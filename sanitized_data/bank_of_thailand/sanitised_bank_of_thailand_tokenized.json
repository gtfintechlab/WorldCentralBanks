    "2013": [
        "The US dollar appreciated against most major and regional currencies following continued recovery in the US economy, particularly in the labour market, and market anticipation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could wind down its quantitative easing (QE) sooner than previously assessed.",
        "Thai baht depreciated slightly since the last meeting.",
        "After strengthening in early April on account of capital inflows into Thai bond and equity markets, the baht subsequently corrected, driven by market concerns over potential capital flow management measures and US dollar strength.",
        "Government bond yields edged lower across the curve thanks to increased demand from foreign investors, particularly in early April, as well as market’s expectation of a policy interest rate cut leading up to this meeting.",
        "The expected cut in policy interest rate was attributed to Thai exports going forward; (2) lower-than-expected Thai economic growth in the first quarter of this year, and (3) low inflationary pressure.",
        "The MPC discussed capital flow developments in the regional bond markets.",
        "The committee noted a recent surge of bond inflows into Malaysia especially in the first two weeks of May, while there were net bond outflows from the Thai market.",
        "This was partly attributable to a resumption of capital inflows into Malaysia following a general election on 5 May.",
        "One member cited the larger size of the Malaysian bond market compared to Thailand, as one factor explaining the former market’s better absorptive capacity, which helped stabilize the Malaysian Ringgit movements.",
        "The overall global economic growth moderated from the previous meeting, with the first-quarter outturns weaker than expected in many cases.",
        "However, the outlook for global growth points towards a gradual recovery, in line with the MPC’s previous assessment.",
        "The US economy has shown signs of gradual improvement with private consumption being the main growth driver, while downside risks remain from income tax increases and automatic cuts in government spending.",
        "The Japanese economy expanded more than expected in the first quarter of this year, spurred by private consumption, which has begun to benefit from economic stimulus policies.",
        "Exports improved in tandem with firmer demand, particularly from the US.",
        "However, low private investment and wages pose risks to economic recovery.",
        "The euro area economies remained mired in recession, due to deep structural problems.",
        "Core member economies, particularly Germany, grew less than expected from moderating private consumption, while France, Italy, and Spain continued to contract.",
        "The Chinese and Asian economies expanded less than previously assessed.",
        "Growth in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong softened from tepid domestic demand.",
        "Meanwhile ASEAN economies moderated from weakening exports, linked in part to China’s slowdown.",
        "Continued robust domestic demand should help sustain growth momentum in ASEAN, however.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained subdued.",
        "Many central banks in the region have lowered policy interest rates since the last meeting, in response to moderation in domestic demand.",
        "In their discussion, the MPC noted that (1) it was premature to judge Japanese economic stimulus policies a success in lifting growth and inflation, as inflation remained very low and structural reforms would take time to take effect.",
        "Assessing the wealth effects of Bank of Japan’s asset purchase program (Q-squared) is also a difficult task.",
        "The MPC noted that, in contrast to its main objective of lower bond yields, Q-squared measure may have played a part in pushing long-term yields higher, through raising inflation expectations.",
        "Despite this policy dilemma, the benefits from yen depreciation and improved market sentiment should also be acknowledged; (2) Q-squared measure may not be a major driver of a recent surge in capital inflows into Thailand, as the Japanese institutional investors allocated their funds mainly towards more liquid, investment-graded assets in advanced economies, such as the US and the Euro area, as well as domestic equity markets; (3) the fact that global inflation has remained subdued despite ultra-loose monetary policy in advanced economies, may be explained in part by the success of inflation targeting regime and central bank independence in anchoring inflation expectations and containing inflationary pressure; and (4) the low and stable global inflation over different phases of business cycles since the adoption of inflation targeting regime by many central banks in 2000 onwards, has made inflation a less reliable indicator of business cycles and economic imbalances.",
        "For this reason, financial indicators, such as credit growth and real estate prices, should be taken into account in assessing potential imbalances and signs of overheating.",
        "Persistently high credit growth and a rapid climb in real estate prices could lead to a build-up of financial imbalances, despite low inflation.",
        "The Thai economy expanded lower than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, from tepid domestic demand.",
        "Private consumption moderated owing in part to lower farm income, and higher household debts which may have held back consumers’ willingness to spend.",
        "Private investment softened, as slower-than-expected global economic recovery led to higher spare capacity in export-oriented industries, thus postponing planned investment.",
        "Support from government spending was temporarily delayed by local government’s budget disbursement.",
        "Exports continued to recover gradually, while core and headline inflation moderated owing to cost factors.",
        "Nonetheless, a structural change related to oil and gas consumption pattern following government’s policy to cease production and sales of benzene 91 in January 2013 contributed to a larger-than-expected drop in private consumption.",
        "The committee has taken this special factor into account in assessing the outlook for economic momentum.",
        "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to expand on the back of solid economic fundamentals including high levels of employment and non-farm income, as well as robust private sector confidence, which should lead to stronger private consumption in the latter half of the year.",
        "Private investment should pick up as the global economy recovers as expected.",
        "Effects of central government’s spending on domestic demand are also expected to become more evident.",
        "Nevertheless, as a result of weaker-than-expected economic outturns in the first quarter, growth projection for 2013 has been revised downward from the last meeting.",
        "Inflationary pressures eased further compared to the previous projection in tandem with downward trend in oil prices, but the cost pass-through to prices is expected to increase as domestic demand recovers.",
        "One member saw a need to monitor an ongoing structural adjustment of the Thai economy as follows: (1) a tightening in labour market has accelerated a substitution of labour by new machinery.",
        "Thus a measure of capacity utilisation that includes redundant older capital stock may be overstating the real supply capacity of the economy; and (2) the tourism and service sectors continued to expand robustly, and may develop to become a main driver of growth, in place of the export sector.",
        "Another member inquired if factors could be identified as key to generating income for the economy going forward.",
        "Staff cited strong underlying economic fundamentals, robust demand for loans, and the labour market flexibility which helped channel workers away from agriculture in periods of falling farm income.",
        "In addition, exporters have become more resilient to baht movements thanks to their continued adjustment.",
        "Financial stability warranted close monitoring, as household debts continued to grow at a high pace, driven by consumer loans.",
        "An accumulation of household debts could potentially weigh on private consumption and overall growth, as well as increase households’ vulnerability to negative income shocks.",
        "Members largely agreed on the following: (1) overall financial statements of households may mask different types of underlying collaterals, which might affect the economy with varying degrees; (2) the informal segment of household debts, which is sizeable, warranted further research and closer monitoring.",
        "The real estate market continued to gain pace, partly attributable to a structural change in real demand.",
        "However, an increase in number of second and higher home mortgages pointed to speculative demand in certain areas.",
        "The MPC judged that the Thai economy should continue to expand on the back of sound economic fundamentals, although downside risks have increased from lower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of this year.",
        "Inflation remained well within the target range.",
        "With the balance of risks tilting towards growth rather than inflation, the MPC saw further room to ease monetary policy and cushion the economy against downside risks to growth.",
        "Key conclusions reached during policy discussion were as follows: Asian economies expanded less than expected and may adversely affect Thai exports’ recovery.",
        "Global financial market remained volatile, leading to persistent capital flows into the region including Thailand, and high baht volatility.",
        "moderating private consumption and investment, together with a delay in fiscal support, which could weigh on economic momentum in the periods ahead.",
        "Some MPC members saw a need to closely monitor developments of public investment in large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as private investment as there could be further delay.",
        "commodity prices, in line with softening global economic outlook.",
        "household debts potentially affecting private consumption and overall growth in the periods ahead.",
        "Buoyant activities in real estate market may have been partially driven by speculation.",
        "One member viewed that the Thai economy still faced risks from capital flows due to interest rate differential which might cause exchange rate volatility.",
        "Some members noted that given ongoing concerns about financial stability and capital flow volatility, complementary policy measures including capital flow management and macro-prudential measures could be considered alongside policy interest rate as needed.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent from 2.75 to 2.50 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC will closely monitor developments of the Thai economy, financial stability risks as well as capital flow situation, and stand ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted.",
        "The US dollar appreciated against most major and regional currencies due to market anticipation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could wind down its quantitative easing (QE) programme sooner, as signs of US economic recovery have become more evident, particularly in the labour market.",
        "Slowing Chinese and emerging market economies also triggered capital outflows from emerging markets, including Thailand.",
        "Thus, the Thai baht and regional currencies depreciated against the US dollar rapidly in the first half of June, before subsequently stabilizing as outflows moderated.",
        "Volatility of the baht increased, but remained relatively low compared with other regional currencies.",
        "Government bond yield curve steepened.",
        "Short-term yields edged lower following the MPC’s decision to reduce the policy interest rate at the previous meeting.",
        "Medium- and long-term yields rose following market’s expectations of Fed’s QE tapering, which led to increased selling of Thai bonds by foreign investors.",
        "However, subsequently more subdued outflows and lower-than-expected government bond issuance announcement for the third quarter helped lower yields to some extent.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "The MPC discussed potential impact of QE tapering on overall financial markets: (1) steepening government bond yield curves in many countries were partly attributable to decreased demand for long-term bonds as investors sought to reduce long-term interest rate risk exposure.",
        "The Thai bond market was also affected, as it has normally been sensitive to external factors; (2) Emerging Asia and Latin America may experience outflows, following significant surges in capital inflows previously.",
        "Despite the difficulties in predicting the effects of shifting risk appetite on capital flows, some members noted that financial markets may have overreacted to Fed’s signals of QE tapering in the short run.",
        "The members pointed out that the Fed’s intention to wind down its QE programme is conditional on more evident and sustained US economic improvement, which may have been misinterpreted by some market participants as a committed timeframe; and (3) rising long-term interest rates may have played some part in delaying the public sector’s new bond issuance.",
        "However, the corporate sector continued to issue its new bonds as planned.",
        "The MPC will closely monitor developments in financial markets and implications for private sector’s financing conditions in the periods ahead.",
        "Overall global economic growth moderated since the last meeting.",
        "While downside risks to growth in advanced economies have decreased, they have edged up in the Chinese and Asian economies.",
        "However, global growth is expected to improve gradually in the latter half of this year.",
        "The US economy grew at a slower pace in the second quarter of this year from softening private consumption following income tax increases.",
        "Nevertheless, improving underlying economic fundamentals, particularly in the labour and housing markets, should help support domestic demand and economic recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "The euro area economies remained weak but exhibited incipient signs of stabilization on the back of improved private sector confidence and production in core member economies, particularly Germany.",
        "In Japan, economic stimulus policies started to have more evident impact on private consumption, production, and exports.",
        "The Chinese economy moderated primarily from exports and investment, though domestic demand should be an important driver of growth going forward on the back of high employment, favourable household and corporate income, and government measures to support investment.",
        "However, China’s economic growth is expected to be less buoyant than in previous years, as the government has signaled its intention to place greater emphasis on sustainability of economic growth.",
        "The Asian economies continued to expand on domestic demand, but weaker exports, linked in part to China’s slowdown, resulted in a more subdued growth compared to the last meeting.",
        "Firmer recovery of advanced economies in 2014 should benefit Asian exports in the periods ahead.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low, partly from softening commodity prices.",
        "Most central banks have consequently kept policy interest rates unchanged since the last meeting.",
        "The MPC saw the need to monitor developments in China closely, including: (1) the ongoing high credit growth in China arising from shadow banking activities, which, if not addressed by appropriate measures, could undermine financial stability; (2) the potential impact of China’s slowdown on Thai exports and tourism, given a high share of Thai exports to China and the large number of Chinese tourists.",
        "One member noted in addition that a prerequisite to a robust economic recovery is the strength of balance sheets of households, businesses, financial institutions as well as governments.",
        "Current balance sheet conditions in both the US and the euro area remained fragile however, thus risks of a more protracted recovery path could not be ruled out.",
        "Growth of the Thai economy moderated from a slowdown in both domestic demand and exports.",
        "Softer private consumption, particularly of durable goods, was an adjustment from the previous extraordinary growth.",
        "Consumers exercised more caution partly as a result of rising debt burden at a time when the impact of government consumption stimulus measures dissipated.",
        "Exports decelerated from supply constraints as well as a slowdown in exports to China since the first quarter of 2013.",
        "Meanwhile the gradual US recovery has not resulted in higher export demand.",
        "Slowing domestic and external demand in turn led to delay in parts of private investment.",
        "Nevertheless, businesses’ investment plans to raise capital intensity remained, with most firms facing no financial constraints.",
        "Thus, private investment should resume as planned once demand improves.",
        "Economic fundamentals such as low unemployment, high non-farm income, as well as accommodative monetary conditions, remained supportive of growth.",
        "The MPC revised growth projection for 2013 down from the previous assessment to 4.2 percent, as a result of a slowdown in domestic demand and exports, and delay in government investment plans especially in water and flood management projects.",
        "Inflationary pressure eased further from softening domestic demand and lower production costs, from both oil and commodity prices.",
        "Risks to financial stability warrant continued close monitoring, as private credit growth and household debt, though decelerating somewhat, remained on a high side.",
        "Some MPC members noted that better performance of Thai exports relative to many countries in the region, may owe partly to increasing product diversification.",
        "Some members expressed a view that long-run potential growth may be adversely affected not only by a slowdown in private investment, but also supply-side issues such as labour shortages and challenges to improving productivity and creating higher value-added products.",
        "The supply constraints cannot be resolved by monetary policy easing or demand stimulus measures, but instead require structural reforms.",
        "Members saw the need to closely monitor developments of the global economy and public investment outlook, both of which remained key risks to Thai economy in the periods ahead.",
        "The MPC deemed the decisions by most commercial banks to keep both deposit and lending rates broadly unchanged despite the policy rate cut on 29 May 2013, as essentially due to concerns about liquidity outlook amid intensified competition in deposit market.",
        "Key factors responsible for banks’ desire to retain their deposit bases included: (1) commercial banks’ ongoing plans to expand lending, (2) government’s need to raise funds for large-scale infrastructure projects through Specialised Financial Institutions (SFIs), and (3) uneven liquidity distribution and different business strategies among commercial banks.",
        "Given high level of competition in both credit and deposit markets, commercial banks were reluctant to lower their interest rates.",
        "The MPC judges that the Thai economy was in transition from the previous extraordinary growth induced by government stimulus measures, and thus should resume its normal growth path in the periods ahead, supported by sound underlying fundamentals such as high employment and income.",
        "The outlook for global growth points towards a gradual recovery, though fragility remains.",
        "The current monetary policy stance remains sufficiently accommodative and supportive of a recovery to normal growth path.",
        "Key conclusions reached during policy discussion are as follows: (1) The global economy expanded less than previous assessment due mainly to China’s economic slowdown which weighed on Asian exports including Thailand, despite some improvement in the US and Japanese economies.",
        "Some members pointed out that several organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had revised down their growth forecasts.",
        "(2) Growth of the Thai economy moderated from domestic demand and exports, partly as a result of rising debt burden coupled with waning government consumption stimulus measures.",
        "Weak domestic and external demand in turn caused a delay in private investment.",
        "The latest downward revision of growth projection is due to weaker-than-expected GDP outturn in the first quarter and the recent softening of economic indicators.",
        "The MPC already took the moderating trend of growth into account when it decided to lower the policy rate in the previous meeting.",
        "(3) Monetary and fiscal policies remain sufficiently accommodative to support growth recovery as reflected in continued credit expansion and fiscal deficit, with financial institutions competing actively to mobilize funds and extend more credits.",
        "(4) Risks to financial stability warrant continued close monitoring.",
        "Notwithstanding a slight moderation, credit growth remained high.",
        "In particular, the rising trend of household debt burden, if continues, could add to overall financial imbalances.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC agreed that risks stemming from financial market and capital flow volatility, with potential implications for exchange rate and financial stability, warrant a continued close monitoring.",
        "The global economy was expected to improve gradually into next year.",
        "G3 economies have shown signs of a continued improvement, notwithstanding elevated downside risks.",
        "Meanwhile, ASEAN economies expanded at a slower pace.",
        "The US economy expanded at a moderate pace on the back of private consumption.",
        "Fiscal uncertainties continued to pose significant downside risks to growth.",
        "While economic impact from the government shutdown should be limited, failure to lift debt ceiling would materially undermine global financial and economic stability.",
        "Given uncertainties in fiscal outlook and tighter financial conditions, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain the pace of asset purchases in their September meeting.",
        "In the Euro area, recovery was supported by better business confidence and lower structural fiscal deficits.",
        "The Japanese economy continued to expand in the second quarter, with growth outlook tempered somewhat by an introduction of consumption tax next year.",
        "The Chinese economy continued to improve from exports, manufacturing production, and investment.",
        "North Asia economies similarly benefited from exports recovery, in line with global demand.",
        "In ASEAN economies, on the other hand, domestic demand has moderated.",
        "External stability risks edged up somewhat, especially for those with a high reliance on exports of goods using medium or lower technologies.",
        "Investors’ greater focus on risks to external and fiscal stability exposed the region to fluctuations in cross-border capital flows and volatile global financial conditions.",
        "In response, policymakers in several countries adjusted their macroeconomic policies by raising policy rate, scaling back oil price subsidies, rectifying current account deficits, and providing domestic as well as US dollar liquidity.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low and most central banks kept the policy interest rates unchanged.",
        "The committee saw failure to negotiate public debt resolution in the US as a key risk that could have implications for global financial market volatility going forward.",
        "In addition, an ongoing recovery of G3 economies remained dependent on unconventional policy support of central banks, which eventually will need to be withdrawn.",
        "The inevitable QE tapering by Federal Reserve could trigger another bout of capital flow volatility, and the committee will need to closely monitor the impact on confidence as well as the real economy.",
        "Volatilities have picked up since the last meeting in major and regional currencies, as well as for money and fixed income markets, from uncertainties about the timing of QE tapering and US public debt problem.",
        "The US dollar initially appreciated, while regional currencies depreciated, during late August to early September, as better-than-expected US data heightened expectations of QE tapering.",
        "But the US dollar then depreciated from the latter half of September, after the FOMC decided to maintain the pace of asset purchase.",
        "Financial market concerns over US government’s debt ceiling also contributed to the US dollar depreciation.",
        "Yields to regional government bonds fluctuated in tandem with the US Treasury.",
        "Thai government yield curve steepened with the market expectations of imminent QE tapering.",
        "As the market adjusted its expectations in late September, the yield curve flattened in line with the resumption of demand from both foreign and domestic investors.",
        "The lower-than-expected government bond supply also contributed to a fall in medium- and long-term yields.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to maintain the policy interest rate at this meeting.",
        "The MPC discussed policy measures adopted by countries in the region, citing in particular an ASEAN economy that was recently given a rating upgrade.",
        "The economy’s fiscal and political stability was viewed as an important factor that has enabled the government to promote investment and successfully boost growth, which in turn improved tax collection and maintained a low cost of borrowing, thus creating a virtuous cycle.",
        "The Thai economy grew less than previously assessed, but began to stabilize and showed signs of improvement in some sectors.",
        "Exports exhibited incipient signs of a broad-based recovery in most product and market segments in line with better global demand.",
        "Nevertheless, Thai exports may grow at a slower pace relative to certain Asian countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, which have a larger share of high-tech exports.",
        "Technological and supply-side bottlenecks in some industries, such as hard disk drives, integrated circuits and textiles, may be constraining exporters’ competitiveness in the world market.",
        "Domestic demand has shown signs of stabilizing.",
        "Private consumption grew primarily from non-durable goods, supported by favorable non-farm income.",
        "Private investment, particularly for construction, continued to expand.",
        "Looking ahead, private investment should continue to improve, underpinned by a gradual recovery of exports and ongoing businesses’ investment plans, with most firms facing little financial constraints.",
        "Inflation edged lower in tandem with subdued production costs and domestic demand.",
        "Accommodative financial conditions and expected global economic recovery should lend support to the Thai economy’s gradual recovery.",
        "Key downside risks stemmed from a delay in fiscal disbursement especially for infrastructure projects as well as uncertain global recovery.",
        "The MPC consequently revised growth projections for 2013 and 2014 down from the previous assessment to 3.7 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.",
        "Inflationary pressure edged lower from softening domestic demand.",
        "One member viewed the slowdown in the economy to have stemmed primarily from the fragile state of the global economy and, to a lesser extent, less support from fiscal policy.",
        "Against this backdrop, monetary policy stance, in terms of the policy interest rate, credit growth, and exchange rate, has been appropriately supportive to the economy.",
        "The deceleration in credit growth has lessened financial stability risks, and has not been a constraint for growth momentum.",
        "In this environment, measures to stimulate demand in the short term may yield limited benefits, especially when the economy’s potential growth may have been affected by supply-side constraints, and still fragile global economy.",
        "The committee agreed that public investment in large-scale infrastructure projects could play a key role in addressing both cyclical and structural challenges to the economy at this juncture.",
        "Current monetary policy remained accommodative, reflected by the still high private credit growth.",
        "The committee concurred that long-term structural constraints to growth could not be addressed by monetary policy.",
        "The MPC discussed potential risks to Thailand’s economic growth and financial stability, which warranted close monitoring as follows: (1) a delayed and lower-than-expected fiscal disbursement could weigh on economic momentum in the short run.",
        "A delay in large-scale public investment projects could also restrain potential growth in the periods ahead.",
        "Members viewed fiscal sustainability, consisting of a more balanced budget and greater emphasis on public investment, as a key factor to bolster market confidence; (2) the recent emergence of current account deficit could be explained in part by unusually high gold imports and repatriation of profits and dividends abroad.",
        "However, the deficit is likely to persist in the coming years due to higher imports of capital goods related to government infrastructure projects.",
        "Such deficit should not as yet be a cause for concern, as it is not driven by domestic overspending; and (3) private credit growth, while decelerating somewhat, remained on a high side, especially for household credits.",
        "The MPC saw the need to closely monitor the development of credits extended by both commercial banks and specialized financial institutions to ensure a smooth transition towards a more balanced financial condition, consistent with a sustained economic recovery.",
        "The MPC judged that the Thai economy has shown signs of stabilization and should recover gradually in the periods ahead.",
        "Fiscal policy was lending support to growth, notwithstanding some delay.",
        "The committee therefore deemed current accommodative monetary policy to be necessary in supporting the ongoing economic recovery, amidst high uncertainties in the global economic and financial conditions.",
        "Six members viewed maintaining the policy rate at 2.50 percent as appropriate with the following rationales: (1) key risks to the Thai economy were volatilities in the global financial markets, in part related to uncertainties over the timing of QE tapering.",
        "Against this backdrop, maintaining the policy rate and monitoring the situation closely remained an appropriate strategy in safeguarding domestic financial stability; (2) the Thai economy was projected to recover at a gradual pace, subject to various constraints.",
        "Financial conditions remained sufficiently supportive, but needed close monitoring to ensure a sustained economic recovery; more sustainable level that is consistent with the real economy.",
        "However, the pace of new household credits and debt accumulation still posed risks and needed to be monitored.",
        "In light of current funding conditions in the banking sector, as well as continued uncertainties in the global financial markets, some members deemed it prudent to conserve policy space.",
        "One member saw limited effectiveness from monetary policy easing in compensating for lower fiscal stimulus at the current juncture.",
        "Instead, expediting public investment and introducing structural reform measures would bring about a more lasting benefit, by boosting long-term potential growth and providing more incentives for private investment.",
        "The committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum.",
        "A member was absent from this meeting.",
        "The US dollar depreciated against major currencies, as uncertainties about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s QE tapering continued, while euro area and Japanese economies showed signs of improvement.",
        "The US dollar appreciated against regional currencies, from financial market concerns over risks to regional economic growth, following a slowdown in Chinese and other Asian economies, with deteriorating fundamentals in some countries.",
        "Thai baht was volatile and depreciated following the release of lower-than-expected second-quarter GDP.",
        "The short-term outlook for Thai baht would largely hinge on (1) economic outlook of major countries, as well as China and regional economies and (2) the timing of Fed’s QE tapering.",
        "Money market rates remained stable while government bond yield curve steepened.",
        "Short-term yields edged lower following increased demand from both domestic and foreign investors, while medium- and long-term yields rose in tandem with the US Treasury bond yields.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to maintain the policy interest rate at this meeting.",
        "The MPC discussed recent rise in financial market volatility in the region, particularly Indonesia, India, and Malaysia.",
        "The market was concerned about current account deficits in the first two economies and fiscal sustainability in the latter.",
        "Relatively high share of non-resident holdings of Malaysian bonds heightened the economy’s exposure to capital flow and exchange rate volatility, despite otherwise sound economic fundamentals.",
        "The global economy continued to improve gradually.",
        "The US economy expanded on the back of manufacturing and housing sectors, while healthier balance sheets of the private sector should help support an ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The euro area economies continued to stabilize, supported by improvement in manufacturing sector.",
        "Growth resumed for the euro area in the second quarter, the first expansion since the third quarter of 2011.",
        "Nonetheless, recovery continued to be weighed by financial health of both real and financial sectors.",
        "The Japanese economy expanded at a gradual pace, due to government’s economic stimulus policies.",
        "The Chinese economy moderated in the second quarter, though recent indicators pointed to some improvement.",
        "Public and private investment should lend support to growth going forward, and downside risks to growth have decreased since the previous meeting.",
        "In Asia, domestic demand slowed down while exports generally remained weak, notwithstanding tentative signs of recovery in exports for some countries.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low and most central banks kept the policy interest rates unchanged.",
        "GDP Q2 2013 was broadly in line with the MPC’s expectation of an economic slowdown in the short term.",
        "Domestic demand and exports were expected to recover gradually, although supply-side constraints could restrain potential growth and limit benefits from prospective global recovery.",
        "Private consumption of durable goods and automobiles continued to decelerate, as adjustment from waning government’s first car tax rebate measure took longer than expected.",
        "Some increase in delinquencies and tightening of credit standards for consumer loans could add to a drag on durable goods consumption.",
        "Recovery in exports has not taken hold, while supply-side constraints in some industries are constraining exporters’ competitiveness in the world market, with repercussion on domestic investment.",
        "Fiscal policy remained supportive of growth, though room for additional stimulus was limited in short term.",
        "The MPC projected the Thai economy in 2013 and 2014 to expand less than previous assessment, from longer-than-expected moderation in private consumption and exports, coupled with a risk of delay in planned government stimulus.",
        "Nevertheless, the overall pace of economic slowdown so far was close to the committee’s previous assessment.",
        "The economy continued to benefit from accommodative financial conditions, which would lend support to economic momentum to some extent.",
        "Inflationary pressure eased from softening domestic demand and subdued production costs, with lower-than-expected headline and core inflation in July.",
        "Some members expressed concerns over the impact of potential default in automobile loans, which could adversely affect prices of second-hand cars, values of collaterals, and potentially the lenders.",
        "While prices of second-hand cars have recently fallen noticeably, members noted that second-hand car loans still accounted for a small share of automobile loans.",
        "A significant portion of first-car loans has also been extended to car dealers rather than consumers, thus limiting wider impact.",
        "While agreeing that the risk was not systemic, the MPC members saw the need to broaden surveillance to cover additional segments of credit markets.",
        "For instance, lightly-regulated car-for-cash loans have allowed easy access to finance based only on registration certificates, while saving cooperatives which have extended substantial loans to civil servants, were not under the central bank’s regulatory domain.",
        "The MPC discussed the likely impact of global market volatility on the Thai economy after the start of QE tapering.",
        "Some members identified two important determinants of asset allocation to emerging markets, namely (1) Fed communication regarding the speed, procedure, and strategy in winding down large-scale asset purchase program, and (2) underlying economic fundamentals in individual emerging economies, which may also have market implications including in Thailand.",
        "Other members emphasized exchange rate expectation as the key driver of capital outflows from emerging markets in recent months, as economic fundamentals usually changed too slowly to justify large swings in market sentiments.",
        "Moreover, some foreign investors may be inclined to consider Asian markets collectively as a group, with little discrimination based on fundamentals.",
        "Members agreed that a close monitoring of capital flow developments was warranted.",
        "One member noted in addition that volatile exchange rate may put upward pressure on inflation in the periods head.",
        "The MPC judged that The Thai economy continued to soften in the second quarter, broadly in line with the committee’s previous assessment, from moderating domestic demand and exports.",
        "The MPC deemed the current accommodative monetary policy to be necessary and Six members viewed maintaining the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum as justified, after weighing the likely effectiveness of further monetary easing against the costs.",
        "Key rationales are as follows: (1) private consumption moderated owing in part to higher household debt burden and advanced consumption of future income.",
        "Further easing of monetary policy may thus have only marginal impact on consumption, but could instead lead to a build-up of financial imbalances; (2) the recovery of Thai exports and private investment mainly hinged upon the global economy, which has already shown signs of gradual improvement; (3) against the backdrop of uncertain global financial conditions and capital flow volatility, further monetary easing might add to market uncertainties, with potentially adverse effect on private sector’s confidence; (4) given an already prolonged period of negative real deposit rates, a cut in policy rate could further discourage saving, with implications for investment and potential growth in the longer term; and (5) the Thai economic slowdown may owe partly to supply-side constraints.",
        "Without pressing ahead with structural reforms to enhance the economy’s potential growth, monetary policy easing would yield only limited payoffs.",
        "One member deemed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate to support the continuity of growth next year, mainly through boosting labour income and helping reduce household debt burden.",
        "Given the time lags involved in monetary policy transmission to the real economy, a policy rate reduction would have a limited impact on growth this year.",
        "In addition, under the current circumstance, domestic interest rates were not a primary factor affecting capital flows, allowing the policy rate to be lowered.",
        "The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum.",
        "Aswin Kongsiri (due to obligations abroad) Global financial market sentiment weakened slightly since the last meeting from political uncertainty in Italy, financial crisis in Cyprus and soft economic releases in the euro area.",
        "Most major and regional currencies depreciated against the US dollar as a result.",
        "Better US economic indicators raised expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could start winding down its quantitative easing (QE) sooner than the market previously assessed, lending further support to the US dollar.",
        "The Thai baht exchange rate was relatively close to the level prevailing at the previous meeting.",
        "However, the baht appreciated notably toward the end of March, boosted by Thailand’s credit rating upgrade by Fitch and more stable economic and political environment relative to other economies in the region.",
        "The baht subsequently corrected and stabilized due to higher demand for the US dollar from domestic businesses.",
        "Short-term money market rates remained close to the policy rate.",
        "Government bond yields declined, driven by lower-than-expected bond supply as well as subdued global market sentiment amid further financial turmoil in the euro area.",
        "Short-term yields edged up from the last meeting before trending lower following an increase in investor demand.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "The MPC discussed the potential drivers of recent capital inflow and baht appreciation, ruled out strong policy responses.",
        "The MPC, however, was satisfied that the BoT’s current exchange rate management framework already entailed systematic steps of policy responses, with specific measures ready to be implemented if and when warranted by the circumstances.",
        "The global economy has shown signs of gradual improvement with similar momentum compared to the previous meeting.",
        "The US economy has improved, evidenced by a number of better-than-expected key economic indicators including housing and labor markets.",
        "Relatively firm domestic demand should help offset the drag from fiscal sequestration to some extent.",
        "However, the issues of debt ceiling and further need for fiscal consolidation remained major risks to US economy and should be closely monitored.",
        "The euro area economies remained weak and contracted by more than expected.",
        "Financial crisis in Cyprus and particularly the government’s decision to bail in depositors have undermined financial market confidence, raising tail risks to the global economy.",
        "The Japanese economy exhibited incipient signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector, while private sector confidence and inflation expectations were boosted by more concrete plans for further stimulus measures.",
        "The Chinese and Asian economies have expanded in line with the MPC’s previous assessment, on account of robust domestic demand and improving prospects of exports.",
        "Several countries announced measures to cool the real estate sector after a recent acceleration in real estate prices.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low.",
        "Most central banks kept the policy rates unchanged; while in India and Vietnam the policy rates were lowered in response to evident slowdown in these economies.",
        "The MPC assessed the US economic recovery to be gradual with risks remaining, a view broadly similar to the Fed’s assessment.",
        "However, the committee also noted that the assumptions regarding US and global growth used by the BoT staff for forecasting purposes were generally more conservative than market consensus.",
        "The Thai economy was assessed to have moderated toward a normal trend in the first quarter of 2013, mainly due to the slowdown in domestic demand after accelerating faster than expected in the previous quarter.",
        "Looking ahead, domestic demand should continue to be a key engine for economic growth, with private consumption holding up and private investment remaining on an upward trend backed by businesses’ shifts toward greater capital intensity given rising labor costs.",
        "The overall domestic demand momentum should therefore continue, supported by favorable household income, high employment, as well as accommodative monetary conditions.",
        "Fiscal stimulus, through public investment in flood management and the two-trillion-baht infrastructure projects should provide support to growth in the latter half of this year and lend further impetus to private investment.",
        "Thus, the MPC adjusted growth projections for 2013 and 2014 slightly upward to 5.1 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile exports should recover slowly in tandem with the global economic conditions, reflected by forwardlooking indicators including export orders.",
        "Japanese yen depreciation has not significantly affected Thai exports, which have closely been integrated into the Japanese supply chain, thus indirectly benefiting from yen depreciation through increased exports of intermediate goods to Japan.",
        "In addition, the cost of imports from Japan, mainly capital and intermediate goods, would also decrease.",
        "Thai exports are also not in direct competition with Japanese goods due to largely different products.",
        "Inflationary pressure may edge up going forward due to supply constraints, higher labor costs, and greater cost pass-through given entrepreneurs’ diminishing ability to hold down prices.",
        "Some members noted that the planned increase in government spending could add to inflationary pressure and risks to fiscal sustainability in the periods ahead.",
        "On the other hand, some members deemed it necessary to monitor the sustainability of domestic demand momentum and whether disbursement of government expenditures would fall short of target.",
        "Risks to financial stability warranted close monitoring, including from (1) the ongoing high household credit growth which could adversely impact households’ debt service ability, particularly for the low-income group; (2) stock market volatility and signs of increased speculation in small-capitalization stocks by individual investors; and (3) continued buoyancy in real estate activities, reflected by a growing number of newly launched residential projects, especially in major regional provinces, with incipient signs of speculation.",
        "The MPC agreed that, if exacerbated, these conditions could lead to a build-up of financial imbalances and undermine the economy’s ability to absorb shocks.",
        "The MPC therefore saw a need to remain vigilant over these financial stability risks, and be prepared to implement appropriate measures as necessary.",
        "The MPC agreed that balance of risks to the Thai economy remained skewed toward financial stability rather than growth.",
        "Nonetheless, members differed in their assessment of the impact of policy rate changes in preventing a buildup of economic imbalances stemming from accelerating domestic asset prices and capital inflows as follows.",
        "Five members deemed maintaining the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum as justified, with varying rationales.",
        "The majority of these members judged that: (1) the global economic recovery path remained close to the previous meeting, despite an increase in tail risks from banking sector problems in the euro area; (2) the Thai economy moderated after accelerating in the previous quarter, but growth momentum is expected to be sustained on the back of sound economic fundamentals; (3) planned public expenditures should add to the overall economic momentum in the periods ahead, but the continuity of private consumption and investment momentum warranted monitoring.",
        "Against the backdrop of ongoing risks to financial stability and the current policy rate that was already supportive of economic growth, maintaining the policy rate to wait for greater clarity on near-term momentum was an appropriate policy.",
        "Meanwhile, one of the five members assessed the Thai economy to be moderating, after postflood recovery reaching its peak in the third and fourth quarters of 2012.",
        "The potential causes of slowdown included the fragile state of the global economy and a softening in domestic demand, as reflected by almost all economic indicators in January and February.",
        "Nonetheless, this member saw a need to carefully assess incoming economic data in the months ahead to ascertain whether the slowdown in domestic demand and exports during the first two months were temporary or persistent.",
        "Until there is greater clarity, maintaining the policy rate at 2.75 percent was therefore deemed appropriate.",
        "One member viewed reducing the policy rate by 0.25 percent as appropriate given that: deteriorate since the last meeting, while core and headline inflation rates trended downward; economy; (3) exchange rate volatility has intensified and baht appreciation has begun to have an evident impact on exports.",
        "A policy rate reduction of 0.25 percent was therefore deemed necessary.",
        "In addition, other complementary measures such as macro-prudential policy should be considered in order to safeguard the Thai economy against these risks.",
        "The MPC thus voted 5 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC will remain vigilant in monitoring global and domestic economic developments and stands ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted.",
        "The global financial market sentiment improved thanks to better-than-expected economic releases from the US and China.",
        "Nonetheless, political uncertainties in parts of the Euro area and concerns that central banks in the region might introduce measures to rein in excessive exchange rate volatility led to more subdued capital inflows into regional bond and equity markets, and corresponding depreciation of regional currencies toward the end of January.",
        "The pace of baht appreciation also decelerated in tandem.",
        "Short-term money market rates remained stable and close to the policy interest rate.",
        "Government bond yields edged lower across the curve following increased demand from both domestic and foreign investors, and markets pricing in a possibility of policy interest rate cut.",
        "Nonetheless, most market participants expected that the MPC would maintain the policy interest rate at this meeting.",
        "The global economy has been more stable and showed signs of improvement since the previous meeting.",
        "In the US economy, there were some improvements in the labour and housing markets.",
        "Private consumption and investment continued to expand and, if sustained, should play a significant role in supporting the economic recovery.",
        "However, the US economy remained subject to downside risks from uncertainties regarding the fiscal consolidation.",
        "The Japanese economy has yet to gain traction but exhibited incipient signs of recovery in manufacturing sector and private investment.",
        "Monetary and fiscal stimulus policies, especially through public investment, should help support the economic growth going forward.",
        "The Chinese and Asian economies have expanded well on the back of strong domestic demand and improving prospects of exports, together with further support from Japanese government stimulus measures.",
        "The eurozone economies remained weak and continued to be in recession.",
        "Better economic confidence and financial market sentiment have not had a clear impact on lifting the real economy, while sovereign debt crisis would take time to resolve.",
        "Some MPC members saw no new evidence to suggest that structural problems in the eurozone and Japanese economies could be resolved sooner than previously assessed.",
        "In some members’ views, the global financial market sentiment remained fragile and would not lend a significant boost to the real economic recovery.",
        "Emerging markets, some members noted, would play an increasingly important role in the global economic and financial systems, which would bring a number of new challenges, including those related to capital movements.",
        "The Thai economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter and for the whole of 2012.",
        "Government and private consumption were the main growth drivers, supported by strong underlying economic fundamentals as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policies.",
        "Exports has gradually recovered in line with more stable global economic outlook and expanding manufacturing production.",
        "Core inflation remained stable, without evident pass-through effect from a minimum wage hike.",
        "The MPC agreed that the economy would continue to expand, and discussed potential risk factors that might undermine growth momentum going forward, including labour shortages, risks to financial stability in some sectors and sustainability of the tourism industry.",
        "Financial stability overall warranted close monitoring with key risks stemming from; household debts which have had some effects on households’ debt servicing abilities.",
        "A number of studies and experiences from other countries suggested that a prolonged period of low interest rates could lead to a build-up of financial imbalances in the economy.",
        "In addition, a pre-condition for macroprudential tools to be effective, is that the policy interest rate is first set at an appropriate level for maintaining macroeconomic stability; various studies found that interest rate differential was a less important determinant of capital inflows when compared to other factors such as investors’ assessment of the economic outlook and expectations of future currency movements and; the relatively low interest rate environment, investors can be induced to search for higher returns as well as speculate in riskier assets, especially in real estate and equity markets.",
        "The MPC therefore deemed it necessary to closely monitor development of these risks and, if warranted, will implement an appropriate policy mix to guard against potential imbalances in the economy going forward.",
        "Looking ahead, the Thai economy is projected to expand on the back of strong domestic demand, particularly from private investment, owing in part to greater machinisation to replace labour which has become more expensive and scarcer.",
        "Exports should also gradually recover and contribute more to growth in the latter half of the year.",
        "As a result, growth projection was revised upward from the previous assessment.",
        "Inflationary pressure has risen slightly in line with improving economic outlook and an increase in oil prices.",
        "The MPC agreed that uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook remained, while the Thai economy continued to expand on the back of strong domestic demand.",
        "Capital inflows were expected to continue, while risks to financial stability warranted close monitoring.",
        "Six members viewed maintaining the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum as justified, given that: (1) despite improving overall global economy, the global economic recovery is still subject to downside risks, from the lingering euro debt crisis and uncertainty regarding the US fiscal consolidation, (2) the Thai economy continued to expand robustly, spurred by the strong domestic demand, which should help sustain growth momentum going forward.",
        "However, one member noted that it was necessary to closely monitor the developments of the Thai economy after some indicators of economic activity moderated in December 2012, and (3) risks to financial stability remained, including from rising asset prices and the high pace of credit growth, especially for household credits.",
        "Policy rate should therefore be kept unchanged, until there is a greater clarity on the overall risks to the economy.",
        "One member noted that interest rate differential played a part in affecting capital inflows, though the strength of this relationship varies over different phases of the business cycles and with financial market sentiments.",
        "With a systematic and appropriate approach for managing capital flows in place, the same member deemed maintaining the policy rate as justified.",
        "Other complementary measures could also be considered as needed.",
        "One member deemed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate on the basis that, despite signs of stabilisation, risks to the global economic outlook particularly for Asian economies remained.",
        "This was evidenced by the downward revision to 2013 global growth projections released by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in January 2013, relative to their previous publications.",
        "Moreover, a recent surge of capital inflows has been larger than in the past, which could cause larger adverse impact on the Thai economy than previously assessed.",
        "In addition, the low interest rate environment was not the only factor driving credit growth, rising household debt or asset prices.",
        "Macroprudential measures should also be used to counter any build-up of financial imbalances.",
        "Against this backdrop, a policy rate reduction would help mitigate risks of capital inflows and still fragile economic momentum, and would send a public signal about the MPC’s concerns on these issues.",
        "The MPC therefore voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum.",
        "Going forward, the MPC will continue to closely monitor risks to financial stability and capital flow situation, and stand ready to take appropriate policy actions as warranted.",
        "Market expectations of the unwinding of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing (QE) were the main drivers of major and regional currencies.",
        "The US dollar appreciated since the last meeting, as financial markets shifted forward their anticipation of QE tapering, following more optimistic statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in October, and better-than-expected labour market data.",
        "As a result, regional currencies and the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Domestic political situation and weaker-than-expected Thai economic data also triggered capital outflows from the equity and bond markets especially in November, and contributed to the baht depreciation.",
        "Government bond yield curve fluctuated with global market sentiments.",
        "Yields initially rose in tandem with the US Treasury, thanks to market expectations of early QE tapering.",
        "However, the depreciation of Thai baht in November may have precipitated some selling of short-dated bonds by foreign investors.",
        "Most market participants expected the Monetary Policy Committee interest rate in the latter half of next year, consistent with economic recovery.",
        "Some members saw the need to closely monitor the potential implications of gold exports and imports for current account deficits and Thai baht.",
        "Although the headline deficit might have contributed to some foreign investors’ concerns about external stability, current account balance remained in surplus after excluding exports and imports of gold.",
        "Members agreed that greater communication regarding this issue would be beneficial.",
        "The global economy continued to recover, led by the major economies, and was projected to grow at a firmer pace next year.",
        "The US economy grew more robustly than expected in the third quarter of this year, owing to a temporary boost from inventory accumulation.",
        "Healthier balance sheets of households and financial institutions should help sustain domestic demand and economic recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "Nonetheless, uncertainties about fiscal policy and the timing of Fed’s QE tapering would continue to weigh on global financial market sentiments.",
        "The euro area economies grew at a gradual pace from domestic demand in core member economies and improving exports, but political situation and fragile balance sheets of financial institutions continued to impede the recovery.",
        "The Japanese economy moderated in the third quarter of this year from contraction in exports and softening private consumption.",
        "Looking ahead, support from domestic demand and government’s economic stimulus policies should continue to provide growth momentum.",
        "The Chinese economy expanded well across all sectors, albeit at a slower pace relative to previous years, given the government’s greater focus on long-term sustainability of economic growth.",
        "The Asian economies continued to grow at a moderate pace.",
        "Exports of the North Asian economies recovered at a more robust pace than those of ASEAN peers.",
        "Given the North Asian products’ technological advantages and greater supply chain integration, these economies were able to benefit more from higher demand from the major and Chinese economies.",
        "Countries with twin deficit problem remained subject to higher risk of capital outflows compared to other countries.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low, and most central banks have consequently kept policy interest rates unchanged since the last meeting.",
        "However, in India and Indonesia the policy interest rates were raised in response to elevated inflationary pressure and widening current account deficits; while in the euro area economies the policy interest rate was lowered in response to the economic slowdown amidst subdued inflationary pressure.",
        "In their discussion, the MPC noted that (1) China’s economic reforms as set out in the Third Plenum, especially the liberalization of exchange rate (linked in part to Yuan greater convertibility), interest rates, and capital account, could have significant implications for the Thai economy, thus warranted close monitoring; and (2) Structural problems remained in China and Japan.",
        "China’s major challenges were to create higher value-added products, reduce income inequality and rein in shadow banking activities.",
        "In Japan, high social welfare spending and public debt, together with low labour productivity, could restrain Japanese economic growth in the periods ahead.",
        "The Thai economy expanded less than expected in the third quarter of 2013 from both private and public spending.",
        "Recovery in exports of goods has not gained traction, though tourism continued to grow well.",
        "The outlook for private consumption was projected to be more subdued than previously assessed, with higher household debt burden holding back consumption of non-essential goods amidst lower consumer confidence.",
        "Private investment has not recovered, as some businesses awaited clearer signs of private demand recovery as well as implementation of public investment in infrastructural projects.",
        "Exports should gradually improve in line with a moderate pickup in external demand, but benefits would be curbed by limitations in competitiveness and lower technological advantage of the export industry.",
        "Core and headline inflation rates edged up in October in tandem with prices of food and beverages, but inflationary pressure overall remained low.",
        "The economy was projected to grow at a slower pace than previously assessed.",
        "Growth was subject to greater downside risks, stemming from further delay in public investment, fragile private confidence which might be compounded by the ongoing political situation, and the uncertain timing of QE tapering which continued to weigh on investors’ confidence.",
        "The committee therefore revised growth projection down from 3.7 to around 3 percent in 2013, which has not taken into account possible additional effects from the political situation.",
        "Projection for 2014 was also revised downward from 4.8 to around 4 percent.",
        "Inflationary pressure remained benign in line with economic outlook.",
        "Concerns over financial stability risks have lessened, as private credits, including to households, continued to decelerate.",
        "Financial conditions, nevertheless, remained conducive to economic recovery, reflected in part by financial institutions’ willingness to lend and continued demand for loans.",
        "Overall credit quality remained healthy, though households’ debt servicing abilities have shown some signs of deteriorating.",
        "Financial institutions have tightened credit standards, particularly for individual borrowers, to strengthen their credit risk management.",
        "Real estate market has cooled from the beginning of this year, in line with lower risk appetite from both buyers and developers.",
        "The committee agreed that clear growth drivers were lacking, and there were several factors impeding an economic recovery, including a high level of household indebtedness, a decline in export competitiveness, and higher downside risks to growth.",
        "Economic expansion in 2014 should be driven in part by a technical rebound in private demand from a low base this year, together with a gradual recovery in exports in line with the global economic outlook subject to structural constraints.",
        "Given this backdrop, macroeconomic policies should remain supportive of economic recovery, particularly through expediting public investment.",
        "The committee saw lower risks to financial stability, as credit growth continued to adjust towards a more sustainable level that was consistent with the real economic activity, after expanding at a high pace throughout the past few years.",
        "Nevertheless, debt servicing abilities might deteriorate further during periods of economic slowdown, and warranted monitoring.",
        "The MPC judged that the Thai economy should expand at a slower pace than previously assessed with greater downside risks compared with the last meeting, with household credit growth moderating somewhat.",
        "The majority of the committee saw further room to ease monetary policy in order to mitigate downside risks and support an economic recovery, given benign inflation outlook.",
        "Six members viewed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate with the following rationales: (1) Downside risks to growth outlook have increased, and it would take time before the economy could resume growing at a normal pace.",
        "Domestic demand remained weak while recovery in exports has not gained traction despite improving global recovery, owing to structural factors.",
        "Some members saw a possibility of slower-than-expected global economic recovery.",
        "Moreover, domestic political situation could further dent sentiments, potentially affecting private spending and tourism, as well as causing further delay to public spending and investment; (2) Inflation edged up slightly following a gradual increase in LPG price but remained low and close to the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Inflation thus was not an immediate threat; (3) Risks to financial stability decreased somewhat, reflected by decelerating private credit growth amid economic slowdown.",
        "There were signs of adjustment in risk appetite for both lenders and borrowers, with financial institutions becoming more stringent in approving loans.",
        "Nevertheless, the MPC deemed it prudent to closely monitor the impact of reducing policy rate on financial stability developments.",
        "Some members noted that while there was room for monetary policy easing at the current juncture, the policy effectiveness in compensating for lower fiscal stimulus would be limited.",
        "One member deemed maintaining the policy rate at 2.50 percent to be sufficiently accommodative as the Thai economy should be able to resume its normal growth next year.",
        "Risks to financial stability remained, while inflation was kept subdued partly due to government measures.",
        "Furthermore, a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy could discourage private savings in the long run.",
        "The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 2.50 to 2.25 percent",
        "The global financial market sentiment improved after the US “fiscal cliff” was averted.",
        "Consequently, most major currencies appreciated against the US dollar except the yen which depreciated due to expectation that the newly elected government would implement additional monetary stimulus measures.",
        "Meanwhile, both equity and bond inflows into the region accelerated on the back of improving global economic outlook.",
        "The Thai Baht strengthened rapidly following the fiscal cliff agreement, but overall movement remained in line with regional trend.",
        "Short-term money market rates stabilised close to the policy interest rate, reflecting market expectation that the MPC would hold the policy interest rate at this meeting.",
        "Government bond yields of all maturities edged higher after the last meeting, in line with investors’ improving assessment of economic outlook.",
        "The global economy overall continued to recover gradually, with signs of improving outlook from the previous meeting.",
        "The US economy gained more traction from sustained improvement in the labour and housing markets as well as businesses’ greater willingness to resume investment after the resolution of fiscal policy impasse.",
        "Nonetheless, uncertainties arising from debt ceiling and sequestration which need to be finalised by February 2013 remained key risks to the economy and could affect short-term confidence.",
        "The Chinese and most Asian economies continued to expand well with domestic demand being the main growth driver.",
        "Nonetheless, there was a view that a potential escalation of the territorial dispute between China and Japan might pose a risk to the region’s growth momentum.",
        "The eurozone economies continued to be in recession, but were projected to recover gradually this year led by core members’ economies particularly Germany.",
        "Progress in the resolution to Greece’s sovereign debt problem also helped reduce the tail risks significantly.",
        "The Japanese economy remained weak, both in terms of exports and domestic demand, while the new government’s stimulus policies were expected to have only a limited impact in accelerating the economic recovery.",
        "Inflationary pressure in many parts of the world remained subdued.",
        "Most central banks consequently decided to keep their policy interest rates unchanged after easing previously, while awaiting greater clarity on the domestic and international developments.",
        "The economy expanded in the fourth quarter by more than previously assessed largely from stronger-than-expected domestic demand, on the back of both private consumption and investment.",
        "In addition to fundamental factors, the outlook for domestic demand is further supported by greater subscriptions to the first-car tax rebate program and accelerating production by car manufacturers, as well as a personal income tax cut in 2013.",
        "Exports have probably passed their trough, with incipient signs of a recovery emerging across major export goods and markets, consistent with higher exports elsewhere in the region.",
        "Meanwhile growth in the service and tourism sectors remained robust, supported in part by strong tourist arrivals.",
        "The overall impact of the first minimum wage hike on businesses’ profit margins, employment, and product prices has not been significant, mainly due to 1) adjustment efforts made by firms including substituting machinery for labour, 2) the currently tight labour market, and flexible labour movements, and 3) highly competitive goods market, which limited the scope for price increases.",
        "Although, based on these considerations, the effect of the second minimum wage increase was expected to be similarly limited, the MPC would nevertheless monitor the situation closely.",
        "The MPC judged that growth momentum in the fourth quarter was stronger than expected and domestic demand outlook should continue to be strong, supported by a number of favourable factors.",
        "As a result, growth projections for 2012 and 2013 have been revised upward to 5.9 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively.",
        "In line with an expected gradual recovery of the global economy, the export sector should lend more support to growth in the latter half of 2013 alongside domestic demand.",
        "While tail risk has declined significantly, overall downside risks to the global economy still outweigh the upside risks.",
        "Inflation pressure was expected to remain subdued, similar to the previous meeting.",
        "The MPC agreed that the accommodative monetary policy stance throughout 2012 had played a significant role in supporting post-flood recovery and helped cushion the Thai economy from the global economic headwinds.",
        "Given that the global economic recovery was still ongoing with lingering uncertainties, and inflation was expected to stay within the target range, an accommodative monetary policy stance remained appropriate in supporting an ongoing Key conclusions reached during policy consideration were as follows: 1) The overall global economy showed signs of stabilization led by improving prospects in the US and China, while Asian economies expanded on the back of strong domestic demand.",
        "Although the eurozone debt crisis and the US fiscal cliff remained major hurdles to global economic recovery, tail risks have declined significantly thanks to progress in policy resolution.",
        "2) The Thai economy continued to expand, supported by robust private consumption and investment as well as fiscal stimulus measures, which were expected to help sustain growth momentum up to the first half of 2013.",
        "Exports showed incipient signs of a broad-based recovery in most product and market segments.",
        "3) The current monetary conditions remained sufficiently accommodative to mitigate global economic risks, with real interest rates continuing to be in negative territory, and private credits expanding robustly.",
        "However, the high pace of credit growth, particularly for certain types of household loans, could raise household debt and lead to a build-up of financial imbalances.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum.",
        "Some members noted that although the current policy rate was appropriate for the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, there was a need to remain vigilant regarding risks to economic outlook and financial stability.",
        "In particular, persistently high credit growth, rising household debt, volatile capital flows in the midst of continued monetary policy easing in major economies, and growing public debt could potentially undermine financial stability going forward."

    "2014": [
        "The Thai baht appreciated owing mainly to better prospects of the Thai economy following the political resolution.",
        "In July, the Thai baht strengthened on improving investor confidence, supported by more concrete public policy as well as the enactment of interim constitution.",
        "This led to capital inflows, particularly into the bond market.",
        "Nevertheless, the baht depreciated somewhat in late July following the release of stronger-than-expected US GDP data and a more upbeat assessment of the US economy by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).",
        "The government bond yields, on the whole, declined since early July, driven by demand from foreign investors on the back of improved confidence in the Thai economic recovery, together with the demand to roll over maturing bonds from local institutional investors.",
        "Most market participants expected no change in the policy rate at this meeting, citing that the current monetary policy stance remained sufficiently accommodative.",
        "Reduced political uncertainty, coupled with clearer government policy direction, led to rising business confidence and more apparent recovery of domestic demand while inflationary pressures remained subdued.",
        "Following the stabilization of the political situation, foreign inflows to both bond and stock markets resumed.",
        "The committee deemed the current framework for exchange rate management suitable for coping with short-term currency volatility.",
        "The global economy continued to improve gradually, led mainly by firmer economic expansion in the US.",
        "The US economy strongly rebounded after a temporary setback in the first quarter.",
        "Looking forward, improving business and consumer confidence, together with strong manufacturing sector, would lend further support for the economic activity.",
        "The euro area economic prospects gradually improved during the second quarter on the back of firmer private consumption and services.",
        "Meanwhile geopolitical risks could affect the fragile economic recovery and warranted close monitoring.",
        "In Japan, economic growth was likely to contract in the second quarter as a result of the rise in consumption tax in April.",
        "Moreover, the benefits of economic reforms, including a corporate tax reduction and demographic policies, would not be immediately materialized.",
        "Against this backdrop, monetary policy stance in Japan was likely to remain accommodative.",
        "Economic expansion in China was expected to continue on the back of recovery in exports and the implementation of stimulus measures, including targeted measures focusing on loans for small businesses.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian economies continued to expand as exports to advanced economies improved even though domestic private consumption softened somewhat.",
        "Global inflationary pressure generally remained subdued.",
        "Most central banks kept their policy rates unchanged, except in Malaysia and the Philippines whose decisions to raise the policy rate were due to rising inflationary pressures and elevated credit growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised policy interest rate for the fourth consecutive times in the light of concern over accelerating inflation, especially in the non-tradable sector.",
        "In the second quarter of 2014, the Thai economy was projected to expand at a stronger pace compared to the previous quarter, as receding political uncertainty encouraged private spending while exports picked up slightly in tandem with improving demand from the advanced economies.",
        "Fiscal spending however fell short of the previous assessment while tourism continued to contract as a result of the lingering concerns over political situation.",
        "Looking forward, domestic demand was expected to be the main driver of growth, with improving private spending and financial institutions providing a continued supportive environment for growth.",
        "Exports of goods, however, were projected to expand less than previously assessed while tourism should gradually recover.",
        "In the short term, the oversight and supervision process of some public investment projects could delay fiscal spending this year, but budget disbursements should accelerate in the following fiscal year.",
        "Inflationary pressures were lower than previously assessed, as a result of lower-than-expected costs passthrough to prepared food prices.",
        "As for 2014 and 2015, the Thai economy was projected to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment.",
        "Economic growth for 2014 may be slightly lower than previously expected due to delays in government spending.",
        "However, private investment and exports should lend greater support to growth in the following year.",
        "Headline and core inflation were slightly below the previous assessment but remained stable.",
        "Some members noted that the recovery of the Thai economy in the periods ahead remained subject to certain risks and warranted monitoring.",
        "The much-needed economic reforms may entail short-term economic repercussion but would lay a strong foundation for the country in the longer term.",
        "Moreover, a few members stressed the importance of close monitoring of geopolitical situations and the ongoing assessment of the ensuing impacts on the global economy.",
        "Regarding the growth outlook, some members considered domestic demand and exports to be the principal drivers of growth.",
        "Domestic demand should be stimulated by the government’s income-generating policies while exports should benefit from increased intra regional trades.",
        "Also, some members reiterated the necessity of continued monitoring of the household debt situation, as the rate of new debt creation still outpaced income growth.",
        "The committee judged that against the backdrop of a more concrete fiscal policy, a resumption of government’s ability to implement short-term economic measures, as well as ongoing economic reforms in various areas, the economy was projected to grow steadily with improving private sector confidence.",
        "The role of monetary policy at this juncture should be to ensure sufficient level of accommodation in order to foster economic growth, which should return to its normal growth path in the periods ahead.",
        "All seven members deemed it appropriate to maintain the policy rate with the following rationales: (1) The economic recovery was firm, with the growth rate in the next twelve months projected to be higher than the historical average level.",
        "Nevertheless, such projection was subject to uncertainty, which justified continued policy accommodation; (2) Current accommodative monetary policy provided sufficient support to ongoing economic recovery without posing risks to overall financial stability and were supportive of the government’s reform effort to lift the potential growth of the economy; (3) Additional monetary policy easing could potentially pose risks to financial stability in the longer term; and (4) A change in policy stance amid the currently stable environment may generate confusing messages to the financial markets.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "The Thai baht depreciated and bond yields rose briefly after the major political change on 22 May 2014, before stabilizing following clearer direction in public policy management and measures to support the economy.",
        "In May, the Thai baht depreciated on weak economic data and political uncertainties.",
        "The political change led to a 20 Satang depreciation, with the baht weakest on 2 June at 32.89 against the US dollar.",
        "The baht appreciated thereafter on improving consumer confidence and resumption of foreign inflows into the stock market.",
        "Government bond yields edged lower slightly in May due to demand to roll over maturing bonds and lower expected supply of new issues.",
        "The political change prompted some short‐term profit taking by foreign investors, pushing up yields.",
        "Also, expectations of greater government spending from the regular budget and infrastructure investment eased market concerns about the new bond supply and economic outlook.",
        "As a result, medium‐ and long‐term government bond yields edged up towards the end of May.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to maintain the policy rate at this meeting, given lower downside risks to growth following the political resolution.",
        "Scope for further monetary easing is also limited given already negative real interest rates and higher inflation.",
        "The MPC discussed the market’s more positive assessments of the economic outlook following a reduction in political uncertainties and clearer direction of economic policies.",
        "Credit rating agencies have also reaffirmed Thailand credit rating and deemed the Thai economic fundamentals to be strong.",
        "The global economy continued to recover led by the US, while the euro area and Japan recovered at a gradual pace.",
        "In China, the risks in the financial sector and economic slowdown moderated somewhat.",
        "The US economy expanded after a temporary setback in the first quarter, with stronger labour market, housing sector, and private investment supporting the economy.",
        "The euro area economies slowed in the first quarter, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to introduce additional monetary measures to stimulate domestic credit and reduce the risk of deflation.",
        "Japan saw contraction in domestic demand as a result of consumption tax hike, but the market held off its expectation of further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan given accelerating inflation.",
        "In China, economic activities began to stabilize after the first‐quarter slowdown, while money market rates stabilized following short‐term improvement in business confidence.",
        "Asian economies remained steady, with domestic demand moderating, and exports providing impetus to growth.",
        "Slower expansion in global trade could, however, pose challenges to exports going forward.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low and most central banks kept their policy rates unchanged.",
        "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, however, increased the policy rate for the third consecutive time from 2.50 in February 2014 to 3.25 percent in June 2014 in response to accelerating inflation stemming from non‐tradable goods’ prices and above‐trend growth.",
        "The MPC agreed that the global economy has strengthened, and discussed remaining risks that warrant monitoring, including: (1) The effectiveness of ECB liquidity‐injection measures, which might have a limited effect on the real economy; (2) Shadow banking risks in China and the potential recurrence of corporate defaults, with possible repercussion on economic growth, although buffer in the banking sector should be adequate; and (3) Changes in trade network, with intra‐ASEAN trade increasingly replacing exports to China, and a shift in supply chain away from China given higher production costs.",
        "Growth in the first quarter of 2014 contracted more than expected, as political uncertainties weighed on domestic demand and tourism.",
        "Government spending, particularly public investment, was constrained by the absence of a fully functioning government.",
        "A tepid recovery in exports offered only a partial offset to the softening growth.",
        "Latest indicators, however, pointed to some stabilization in private demand.",
        "Inflation edged up somewhat from a pass‐ through of energy costs to prices of prepared food.",
        "Looking ahead, the economy was projected to recover on the back of improving domestic demand following the political resolution.",
        "Fiscal policy should lend greater support to growth, through accelerated disbursement of the 2014 fiscal budget, timely preparation for 2015 fiscal budget, infrastructure investment as well as other fiscal measures.",
        "Private consumption and investment should recover on the back of improving private confidence and fiscal relief measures including repayments of overdue debts under the rice pledging scheme.",
        "Recovery in exports of goods should be more evident in the latter half of the year, as trading partners’ demand strengthens.",
        "But export growth may be limited by low commodity prices, slower demand recovery of some trading partners, domestic structural constraints and shifting global trade pattern.",
        "Tourism sector may also recover only slowly due to visiting countries’ security concerns.",
        "On balance, the committee revised growth projections up from last meeting to 1.5 percent for 2014 and 5.5 percent for 2015.",
        "The upgrade can be attributed to an improvement in public spending and a recovery in private demand after political uncertainties waned.",
        "Tourism should contribute more to growth in 2015.",
        "Inflationary pressure was higher than the previous assessment as a result of larger‐than‐expected costs pass‐through to prepared food’s prices.",
        "Regarding financial stability, households’ debt‐servicing ability declined from falling income.",
        "Credit quality, particularly for auto loans, deteriorated somewhat.",
        "Profitability and ability to service debt of some corporations also saw greater impact from economic and political uncertainties.",
        "However, financial stability risks were confined to the low‐income households and SMEs, and did not pose a systemic threat.",
        "Banks continued to tighten credit standards on new loans, but were also providing support to existing customers facing short‐term difficulties.",
        "Looking forward, concerns about private debt‐servicing ability and credit quality should ease with economic recovery, which in turn hinges partly on timely and effective implementation of government policies.",
        "Some members highlighted remaining risks to a recovery, as follows: (1) Large outflows of migrant workers could further tighten the labour market and exert upward pressure on wages, given labour shortages in sectors such as agriculture, fishery, and services; (2) Possible ramifications on Thailand’s international trade relations with its trading partners due to unintended consequences of domestic policies such as those related to labour; and (3) Efficiency of budget disbursement might be lower than target, curbing the contribution of public spending to growth.",
        "The committee noted the importance of monitoring long‐term risks to fiscal sustainability.",
        "Key issues included the structural shortfall of government revenues relative to expenditures, and legal loopholes allowing off‐budget spending without formal parliamentary approval.",
        "Agenda for fiscal reform should aim to create a credible framework to safeguard fiscal discipline, while preserving sufficient flexibility for needed fiscal measures in exigent circumstances.",
        "The committee judged that Thailand’s economic recovery should pick up pace in the second half of this year, given reduced political uncertainties and a resumption of functioning public policy management.",
        "The committee discussed how the role of monetary policy should adapt with changing circumstances.",
        "Members agreed that more active fiscal policy should lend support to the economic recovery while prevailing monetary policy stance remained accommodative as well as conducive to safeguarding long‐term financial stability.",
        "All seven members voted to maintain the policy rate with the following rationales: (1) The Thai economy should recover in the second half of this year, as reduced political uncertainties and clearer public policy led to improving private sentiments, lending support to domestic demand.",
        "Targeted fiscal policies, such as the repayment to farmers in rice pledging scheme and liquidity provision to SMEs through specialized financial institutions, should help support those sectors that are more vulnerable to economic slowdown and reduce their financial fragility; (2) Current financial conditions remained sufficiently accommodative in supporting a sustained economic recovery, with real interest rates continuing to be negative and the Thai baht remaining stable.",
        "Some members noted that higher inflation had pushed real interest rates further into the negative territory; (3) While inflation remained well within target, short‐term inflationary pressure has edged up higher than previously assessed; and (4) Maintaining the policy rate was appropriate against the backdrop of stable domestic financial markets and impending interest rate normalization in major economies.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "Narongchai Akrasanee, and Arkhom Termpittayapaisith.",
        "The MPC recognized the merits for adopting headline inflation as the new policy target.",
        "A consultation with the Minister of Finance should proceed, with a consent on a target range of 3.0 ± 1.5 percent for the year 2015 on an annual average basis.",
        "After a mutual agreement has been reached, the proposal would be sent to the Cabinet for approval.",
        "The following rationales were discussed.",
        "(1) Headline inflation could be easily understood by the public and would better reflect the cost of living.",
        "The new target would promote central bank communication and the anchoring of inflation expectation.",
        "(2) The central target of 3.0% should be appropriate.",
        "It is broadly in line with the targets of the trading partners, and thus should help maintain Thailand’s competitiveness.",
        "The level is consistent with average long-term inflation expectations, and comparable to the previous midpoint for core inflation target.",
        "(3) Economic conditions next year were expected to be favorable for the transition.",
        "Inflationary pressure should remain subdued, amid moderate global commodity prices.",
        "Inflation should remain within the proposed target range even after taking into account the energy price restructuring planned by the government.",
        "Since the previous meeting, the Thai baht has been stable, moving in line with other regional currencies.",
        "The baht strengthened in early August on the back of improved fundamentals of Asian economies and reduced geopolitical tensions.",
        "Since then, the baht has been depreciating, driven by broad US dollar strength, owing to stronger US data and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) signal of an earlier rate hike.",
        "Greater policy divergence among major central banks led to a sharp appreciation of the US dollar, though the baht and other regional currencies depreciated relatively modestly, thanks to stronger fundamentals.",
        "The government bond yields moved in a narrow range.",
        "Short-term yields were stable, while medium-term yields declined somewhat from greater foreign investors’ demand, as the prospect for recovery became more apparent.",
        "Long-term yields rose slightly due to profit-taking, after falling to a low level previously.",
        "Market participants expected no policy rate change at this meeting, deeming the current monetary policy stance to be already supportive of economic recovery for the remainder of the year, and expecting inflation to be contained.",
        "However, a few participants saw the possibility of gradual rate normalization next year, as the recovery should start to gain traction.",
        "The global economy continued to recover gradually but was characterized by greater growth differentials.",
        "The US economy continued to expand, and the market expected the first Fed funds rate hike in the second half of 2015.",
        "Meanwhile, the euro area experienced weaker growth in the second quarter of 2014, weighed down by geopolitical tension and temporary weather-related factors.",
        "After a significant contraction in the second quarter, the Japanese economy should recover gradually, on the back of stimulus measures and stronger exports.",
        "Outlook for China remained unchanged from the previous assessment, with the continuing attempt to maintain a balance between longer-term reforms and short-term support to the economy.",
        "Growth in Asian economies should remain stable, as the cyclical improvement in the electronics exports helped offset domestic demand deceleration.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained subdued and most central banks continued to maintain policy rates.",
        "The European Central Bank, however, lowered the policy interest rate to address the risks of deflation.",
        "The Bank of Korea also cut the policy rate, in order to shore up domestic demand.",
        "The central bank of the Philippines, meanwhile, raised the policy rate to contain inflationary pressure.",
        "Private confidence improved, and domestic economic activities have begun to recover thanks to more stable political environment.",
        "July readings showed improved private sentiments and spending, due in part to government support to household purchasing power, healthy non-farm income, as well as more active public spending.",
        "However, structural impediments and weak agricultural prices have affected exports by more than previously assessed, weighing on the recovery.",
        "Tourism would take time to recover to normalcy.",
        "Inflation edged down from the prices of raw food and energy, as well as the phasing out of pass-through from LPG costs to prepared food prices.",
        "The committee maintained growth projection for 2014 at around 1.5 percent, as the improvement in domestic demand should offset weaker-than-expected recovery in exports of goods and services over the year.",
        "However, growth projection for 2015 was revised down to around 4.8 percent, to reflect slower recovery in exports and tourism.",
        "Inflationary pressure was revised down from lower cost pressure.",
        "Inflation expectations remained stable.",
        "In the committee’s view, the overall financial stability has improved following the political resolution that has shored up private confidence and led to clearer prospects for government’s economic policy.",
        "Corporate bond issuance and demand for credit picked up for some business sectors.",
        "Real estate sector saw some rebound in activities, after a previous slowdown.",
        "Meanwhile, household debt has begun to stabilize as a percentage of GDP, as new debt slowed and household income rose modestly.",
        "There was a view among members that a prolonged period of low interest rates could discourage household savings and induce investment in riskier assets.",
        "Some members expressed concerns over supply side limitations that may impede exports of goods going forward, necessitating concerted efforts from all stakeholders to address the problem.",
        "The MPC judged that the economic recovery was at an early stage, driven primarily by private consumption and public spending.",
        "Meanwhile, exports would recover slowly and it would take time for fiscal policy to bear more material effects on growth.",
        "Monetary policy should therefore be sufficiently accommodative to support the ongoing economic recovery, while at the same time consistent with the safeguarding of long-term financial stability, against the backdrop of contained inflationary pressure and stable financial system.",
        "Five members viewed maintaining the policy rate as appropriate with the following rationales: accommodation was needed to support and sustain economic recovery.",
        "economic recovery, which should pick up pace in the second half of this year.",
        "Fiscal policy should also lend further impetus to growth going forward.",
        "Broad economic reform agenda under the current government should bring about tangible results in due course, and should help bolster long-term potential growth.",
        "The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "The global economic recovery was slightly weaker than expected, with greater growth differentials among the major economies.",
        "The US economy continued to recover steadily, consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)’s assessment that the recovery of labor market conditions strengthened further.",
        "Against this backdrop, the FOMC concluded its asset purchase program (QE) in the latest meeting.",
        "The euro area economic growth was likely to slow down further as domestic demand recovery remained tepid, partly due to fragile private sector confidence and spillovers from the political tension between Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Nevertheless, the additional monetary stimulus might help mitigate the risk of recession.",
        "The Japanese economic recovery was weaker than previously assessed, not only from weak consumption and production, but also from structural problems.",
        "This led Japan to announce extra liquidity injection (QQE) in addition to the existing measures to lift potential growth of the economy in the long run.",
        "The Chinese economy moderated somewhat, mainly from the slowdown in domestic demand.",
        "Going forward, the recovery in consumption and exports, as well as supportive measures from the government, should be the main driver of growth.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian economies experienced more differentiated growth as the ASEAN economies slowed down slightly, while North Asian economies picked up on the back of better domestic demand and exports.",
        "Overall inflationary pressure remained low due to falling oil and commodity prices.",
        "Most central banks left policy rates unchanged.",
        "In the committee’s view, the increasing policy divergence among the major economies could potentially trigger higher volatility in the global financial markets.",
        "While its impact on emerging Asian economies was expected to be limited given relatively sound economic fundamentals, the committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor the development of monetary policy in major economies and its impacts on capital flows and Thai economy.",
        "Higher risks to global economic recovery resulted in the reallocation of assets and higher volatility in global and Thai financial markets.",
        "Nevertheless, volatility in the domestic financial market remained modest relative to that in regional markets.",
        "The Thai Baht depreciated by 1.3 percent over the intermeeting period, following the strengthened outlook of the US dollar as global economic growth became more uneven.",
        "Weaker-than-expected readings and downward revision of domestic growth also weighed on the Thai baht.",
        "Yields on medium- and long-term Thai government bonds moved down by 19-48 bps following a reduction in US Treasury yields after the FOMC highlighted the consequences of weak global recovery on the US economy.",
        "Slow domestic recovery and lower-than-expected government bond issuance also contributed to the reduction in yields since the last MPC meeting.",
        "Short-term interest rates remained stable, reflecting market expectation that the policy rate would be left unchanged at this meeting.",
        "This was in line with the survey result which indicated that most market participants expected the MPC to maintain policy rate until the second half of 2015 to support economic recovery given subdued inflation.",
        "The economy in the third quarter of 2014 was expected to expand less than previously assessed, on account of slow recovery in domestic demand and weak exports.",
        "The recovery of private consumption, in particular, was slow to gain traction due to declining farm income and high household indebtedness.",
        "Exports recovered slowly in most market segments and products, while the delay in fiscal disbursement, particularly public investment, partly caused the corporate sector to postpone new investments.",
        "Against the backdrop of weaker-than- expected economic momentum in the third quarter, the MPC projected the overall economic growth in 2014 to be less than the previous assessment.",
        "Looking ahead, the Thai economy should continue to recover in 2015, albeit with greater downside risks to growth.",
        "Fiscal support, through public spending as well as greater clarity and continuity of policies particularly on public investment, should serve as the main growth driver and help boost private sentiment and spending.",
        "Exports of goods should pick up in tandem with trading partners’ growth, with lower commodity prices posing downside risks to exports prices of some products.",
        "Tourism should gradually recover, supported mainly by tourist arrivals from Asia.",
        "Inflation was lower than previously assessed, as a result of softening world crude oil prices and subdued demand-side pressure.",
        "The committee concurred that government spending, through short-term fiscal stimulus measures and public investment, particularly large-scale infrastructure projects, is necessary in supporting growth and enhancing long-term competitiveness of the economy.",
        "Moreover, clarity and continuity of government policies should lend further support to private consumption and investment.",
        "One member noted that lower agricultural prices could weigh on the value of exports and households’ purchasing power, with repercussion on the recovery of private consumption and inflationary pressure going forward.",
        "This, therefore, warranted close monitoring.",
        "Overall risks to financial stability decreased somewhat as the economy gradually recovered.",
        "The pace of household sector’s new debt creation already slowed.",
        "Nonetheless the elevated level of indebtedness, particularly among the low-income households, could potentially affect private consumption and debt-servicing abilities.",
        "Meanwhile, real estate sector gained pace following a gradual recovery in domestic demand, with the general house price growth remaining close to the historical average rate.",
        "Corporate sector’s financial position remained healthy in general.",
        "Signs of risk-taking behaviors increased somewhat, as reflected in a price surge of small- and medium-capitalization stocks, and warranted monitoring.",
        "The committee assessed that, against the backdrop of low inflationary pressure, the Thai economy should continue to recover in 2015.",
        "Monetary policy was accommodative and not hindering the ongoing economic recovery, while also remaining consistent with long-term financial stability goals.",
        "Nevertheless, the committee expressed concerns over higher downside risks to growth from global economic conditions and the timeliness of public investment spending.",
        "Six members viewed maintaining the policy interest rate as appropriate with the following rationales: accommodative and appropriate given the steady path of economic recovery in 2015. the recovery.",
        "One member voted to reduce the policy interest rate by 0.25 percent per annum.",
        "The member judged that, in the environment of subdued price pressure and contained risks to financial stability, monetary policy should be eased further in order to cushion the economy against greater downside risks from the global economy as well as softer-than-expected domestic recovery.",
        "Higher degree of policy accommodation would add support to the economy as the impact of some fiscal measures was expected to be short-term and public investment continued to be subject to delay in the implementation stages.",
        "The committee thus voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy interest rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC will closely monitor developments of the Thai economy, and will pursue appropriate policy to ensure adequate support to the recovery, as well as long- term financial stability.",
        "The Thai baht stabilized and appreciated slightly on the back of (1) peaceful general election on February 2[nd] and more stable political situation; (2) depreciation of the US dollar following weaker-than-expected data; and (3) improved sentiments on emerging markets and Asian economies.",
        "Capital inflows to Thailand started to resume in March, especially the equity market which saw positive net inflows.",
        "The government bond yields declined, driven by higher demand from domestic institutional investors and lower expected issuance of government bonds owing to delayed public investment.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to reduce the policy interest rate at this meeting, citing economic slowdown and subdued inflationary pressure.",
        "The MPC’s decision to hold the policy rate in the last meeting, while unanticipated by the market, led to little adjustments in the foreign exchange market.",
        "Money market rates ticked up marginally.",
        "In the committee’s view, the global financial markets have been less volatile since the last meeting.",
        "Credit rating agencies’ affirmation of a stable outlook for Thailand had a positive impact on foreign investors’ sentiments.",
        "Nevertheless, some members saw the need to monitor risk factors, including political situation and household debt, which might weigh on economic growth and credit outlook going forward.",
        "Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) for the Thai baht appreciated slightly on improving current account balance but remained supportive of growth.",
        "The global economy continued to recover, led by the major economies.",
        "The US economy expanded steadily, despite slowdown in the housing sector from higher mortgage rates.",
        "Softer recent indicators owed partly to a temporary cold weather, and should not materially affect the recovery path.",
        "At its latest meeting, the FOMC maintained the pace of asset purchase reduction and reiterated its intention to keep policy rate low for some period.",
        "The euro area economies continued to grow while deflation risks remained low.",
        "In Japan, domestic demand accelerated before the introduction of consumption tax hike, resulting in a pickup in production and imports.",
        "Consumption should decelerate after the tax hike takes effect in April.",
        "The Chinese economy continued to expand, but investment moderated due partly to policy reforms in local government and financial sectors.",
        "In Asia, exports improved in tandem with a recovery in major economies while domestic demand held up well.",
        "Nevertheless, domestic demand in ASEAN economies was weighed by slowing private investment and public spending.",
        "Exchange rates of emerging market economies recovered from the previous drop triggered by QE tapering, partly due to credible policy responses in countries such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brazil.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained subdued, notwithstanding somewhat higher inflation in Asia.",
        "Most central banks have kept their policy rates unchanged given steady improvement in domestic demand.",
        "The committee noted that risks related to local government debts and shadow banking issues in China were difficult to analyze precisely given data limitations.",
        "Assessments of these risks by private analysts also varied.",
        "The committee nevertheless acknowledged the importance of the Chinese government’s structural reform efforts towards greater reliance on market forces.",
        "These should yield long-term benefits, although there might be some costs to growth in the short run.",
        "Growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was close to the previous projection, with some improvements in exports helping offset lower-than-expected domestic demand.",
        "The latest indicators pointed to weaker economic momentum, as domestic demand continued to be soft and the effect of political situation on tourism became more apparent.",
        "Meanwhile, exports continued to recover steadily.",
        "Risks from a prolonged political uncertainty remained, and could subject private sentiments to further retrenchment, affecting consumption.",
        "Households’ purchasing power was already made fragile by lower farm income and high household indebtedness.",
        "Private investment was subject to further delay, amid rising political and economic uncertainties, and uncertain outlook for public investment.",
        "Tourism was expected to feel more impact from political uncertainty, particularly for tourist arrivals from Asia.",
        "Exports, especially of consumption goods to the major economies, should improve with the global recovery, and serve as the main growth driver in the periods ahead.",
        "Inflation continued to edge up, as energy cost was passed through to prices of prepared food.",
        "Looking ahead, the Thai economy was projected to grow less than previously expected as a result of weaker domestic demand, despite expected improvement in exports.",
        "The committee revised their growth projection down from around 3 percent to 2.7 percent for 2014, and 4.8 percent for 2015.",
        "Inflation was projected to increase in tandem with expected pass-through of LPG costs to prices of prepared food, but demand pressure on prices remained low.",
        "Financial stability issues were discussed, with respect to the resiliency of various economic sectors to withstand the economic slowdown.",
        "Corporate and real estate sectors’ financial positions remained healthy.",
        "Households’ debt-servicing abilities deteriorated somewhat from previously accumulated fragility, potentially weighing on their spending outlook.",
        "Financial conditions overall remained accommodative, as reflected by generally low financing costs and banks’ loan targets which remained consistent with nominal GDP growth.",
        "Improving efficiency of public finance management, on both the revenue and expenditure sides, remained a longterm challenge to fiscal sustainability.",
        "Members agreed that the ongoing political uncertainty posed a key downside risk to growth, through delayed government spending and deteriorating private sector confidence, with potential repercussions on private consumption and investment.",
        "Nevertheless, exports should continue to recover gradually in line with the global economy.",
        "The committee noted several issues that warranted monitoring in the periods ahead, against the backdrop of ongoing economic slowdown: (1) Liquidity and debt-servicing abilities of businesses, especially small- and medium-sized ones, could deteriorate.",
        "Alleviating these risks somewhat are commercial banks’ efforts to strengthen their risk management.",
        "Corporate funding costs overall also remained low and were generally not an obstacle for businesses; (2) Government tax revenue this year could fall short of target.",
        "Structurally, government’s revenue collection was also significantly lower compared with those of developed countries; (3) A prolonged period of economic slowdown might hinder the corporate sector’s efficiency and competitiveness.",
        "These longer-term implications should be taken into account alongside the assessment of cyclical developments.",
        "The MPC judged that downside risks to growth have risen in the wake of prolonged political uncertainties.",
        "In their discussion, the committee evaluated the need and effectiveness of further monetary policy easing to cushion the economy in the short term, against potential costs to financial and price stability.",
        "The majority saw further room to ease monetary policy, in order to mitigate downside risks and lend more support to the economy, as well as to ensure continuous financial accommodation.",
        "A policy easing was also justified by subdued inflationary pressure and lower financial stability risks, reflected in part by decelerating private credit growth and more stable global financial market.",
        "Four members viewed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate with the following rationales: (1) Monetary policy should play a greater role in supporting the economy, given higher downside risks to growth stemming from the ongoing political situation, and still fragile domestic demand and exports which would take time to recover; (2) Even though core inflation has edged up following an increase in prepared food price, it remained low and close to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "Given subdued domestic demand and stable world crude oil prices, inflation was not an immediate threat; (3) Improved global financial market sentiments helped contain capital flows and exchange rate risks; and exposed to economic slowdown, such as small and medium enterprises and households.",
        "Three members voted for maintaining the policy rate at 2.25 percent for the following reasons: (1) The current monetary policy stance was deemed adequately accommodative and supportive of economic recovery; (2) Maintaining the policy rate was consistent with the committee’s inflation forecast, amid rising core inflation; (3) Global financial market conditions remained sensitive to the shift in monetary policy in the US; and (4) The main headwinds to growth were political uncertainties, and not financial in nature.",
        "Further monetary policy easing would likely have a limited impact on growth at the current juncture.",
        "Monetary policy space should thus be conserved, until such time as it would be more effective in supporting the economic recovery.",
        "The MPC thus voted 4 to 3 to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 2.25 to 2.00",
        "Uncertainties regarding the timing of policy rate hike by Federal Reserve were the main drivers of exchange rates and government bond yields since the last MPC meeting.",
        "The Thai baht depreciated toward the end of March, following the Federal Open Market Committee increase.",
        "The baht appreciated in April, however, led by weaker-than-expected US employment and the FOMC minutes which reiterated the intention to normalize the policy rate only gradually.",
        "Contained domestic political situation also contributed to the baht appreciation in early April, resulting in relative stability of the Thai baht.",
        "Government bond yields declined slightly since the last meeting, in tandem with the US Treasury and as a result of lower expected issuance of government bonds amid a delay in large-scale public investment.",
        "Net capital inflows resumed in both equity and bond markets since April.",
        "Nearly all market participants expected the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to maintain the policy interest rate at this meeting, citing already accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Market participants also noted that a further easing of monetary policy may not provide a meaningful boost to the economy, given that the main headwind to recovery was the ongoing political situation.",
        "In their discussion of financial market developments, the committee noted the relative stability of the Thai financial markets at present.",
        "Volatilities of both the exchange rate and capital flows were contained, while a decline in government bond yields and narrowing corporate bond spreads helped lower borrowing costs for the private sector.",
        "Thus, financial conditions remained conducive to an economic recovery.",
        "At the same time, the committee acknowledged the risks that market developments could change quickly.",
        "Members considered stable and accommodative financial conditions as vital to maintaining market confidence, and fostering economic recovery and macroeconomic stability in the long-run.",
        "The global economy improved at a gradual pace, led by the US and Euro area economies, although the Japanese economy decelerated, and risks in the Chinese financial sector have increased.",
        "The US economy continued to expand after the temporary effect of cold weather.",
        "The Euro area economies continued to recover, on the back of the domestic demand and exports.",
        "The Japanese economy moderated as domestic demand fell short of expectation in the first quarter, with the increase in consumption tax impeding private consumption.",
        "The Chinese economy saw slowing domestic demand and a contraction in exports.",
        "Risks in the financial sector have increased, following defaults in corporate bonds with credit ratings below AA as well as the trust products.",
        "Tighter government regulations led to slowing activity in the real estate sector.",
        "In Asia, especially ASEAN, exports benefited from the advanced economies’ recovery while domestic demand generally decelerated.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low and most central banks kept their policy interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand however increased the policy rate on 13 March 2014 from 2.50 to 2.75 percent in response to inflation concerns.",
        "The MPC discussed economic policies set out by the Chinese government.",
        "These included the rebalancing toward consumption in place of investment as a driver of growth, urbanization policy to expand developments to the inner cities, as well as the promotion of labor mobility to support domestic demand growth.",
        "Furthermore, one member saw the need to monitor elections in India and Indonesia, the results of which could have implications for these countries’ policies, the global economy, as well as cooperation with the ASEAN countries going forward.",
        "Growth in the first quarter of 2014 was expected to contract by more than previously assessed on account of both public and private spending, as well as tourism, which have felt more impact from the ongoing political situation.",
        "Exports of goods gradually improved but could not compensate for the overall slowdown.",
        "Looking ahead, the recovery path would hinge mainly upon the political developments.",
        "Prolonged political situation and delay in forming a functioning government will have repercussions for the enactment of the 2015 Budget Act and public spending.",
        "Private investment has softened from fragile business confidence amid uncertain outlook for public investment.",
        "Businesses have also postponed new investment given ample spare capacity from previous investment.",
        "Private consumption has not gained traction due to subdued income growth and elevated household debt burden.",
        "The outlook for tourism should benefit from the lifting of the emergency decree in Bangkok and its vicinity.",
        "Exports of goods should improve in tandem with trading partners’ growth.",
        "But the slowdown in China could weigh on the exports of some consumption goods, including rubber and cassava.",
        "Meanwhile, border trade has been expanding well, commanding a rising share of total exports.",
        "The MPC projected the Thai economy in 2014 to expand less than previous assessment, from weaker-than-expected economic momentum in the first quarter, with political impasse posing greater downside risks to domestic demand and tourism.",
        "However, the economy should be able to resume its normal growth next year.",
        "Inflation rose as expected, following a passthrough of LPG costs to prepared food price, but demand pressure on prices remained subdued.",
        "One member noted the possibility of higher inflationary pressure, should there be further withdrawals of government subsidies on energy or other public services.",
        "In the committee’s view, the debt-servicing abilities of low-income households as well as small and medium enterprises warranted monitoring, as they could deteriorate further with economic slowdown.",
        "To manage this risk, financial institutions have tightened credit standards, particularly for personal loans, and introduced measures to manage debt-servicing burden for some customers.",
        "The banking system itself remained sound, as commercial banks have previously increased their loan loss provision and strengthened their capital buffer.",
        "The MPC expressed concerns over several structural issues, which, if not addressed in a timely manner, could restrain potential growth in the long run.",
        "These issues included: share of current expenditures relative to investment.",
        "Without a public finance reform, it would be difficult to balance the budget on a sustainable basis, especially given aging demographics and higher social welfare liability; (2) Inequality, in terms of income distribution, access to education and healthcare, has worsened despite continued economic expansion.",
        "Failure to address these problems could undermine long-term social and economic stability; (3) Supply bottlenecks, such as labour shortages and challenges to improving productivity and creating higher value-added products, could reduce Thailand’s attractiveness for long-term foreign capital and competitiveness in the world market; and (4) The sustainable use of natural resources, given rapidly expanding number of tourists.",
        "The MPC concurred that these structural issues could not be resolved by monetary policy, but required concerted efforts and cooperation from all stakeholders.",
        "The committee deemed prolonged political uncertainties to be the main cause for higher downside risks to growth, while room for further policy accommodation was diminishing.",
        "Two key issues were discussed: (1) The need to maintain accommodative financial conditions to support the economy in the short run; and (2) Possible side effects that might arise from a prolonged period of low interest rates.",
        "The majority of the committee agreed that financial conditions were not hindering economic activities.",
        "Based on a range of measures, the degree of monetary policy accommodation was assessed to be relatively high and thus remained supportive to growth.",
        "Six members voted to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum with the following rationales: (1) Monetary policy remained adequately accommodative to support the economy in the short run.",
        "Remaining policy space should be conserved as further policy easing would likely yield limited growth benefits amid lingering political uncertainties; (2) Maintaining the policy rate was conducive to safeguarding stability in the domestic financial markets; (3) Financial institutions continued to function normally in supporting the economy and assisting customers to manage short-term difficulties, despite some tightening in credit standards ; and financial stability, needed to be taken into account.",
        "One member voted to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent as downside risks to growth remained elevated from uncertain domestic demand outlook.",
        "The pace of export recovery was also subject to uncertainties.",
        "Thus, monetary policy should be eased further in order to send a clearer signal of continued accommodative policy stance.",
        "The MPC thus voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 2 percent per annum.",
        "In 2012, the MPC proposed the switch of monetary policy target from core inflation to headline inflation as it would better reflect the cost of living and public inflation expectation.",
        "This in turn would help enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectation.",
        "On 17 September 2014, the MPC confirmed the suitability of headline inflation as monetary policy target and sought consultation with the Minister of Finance to set annual average headline inflation of 3.0 ± 1.5 percent as the target for 2015.",
        "With a mutual agreement, the monetary policy target would be submitted to the Cabinet for approval.",
        "After the September meeting, however, the crude oil price trended down significantly as a result of weak global demand and expanding global oil supply, particularly from the US and other non-OPEC countries.",
        "Rather than opting for production cut to shore up falling oil price as in the past, OPEC countries decided to maintain their current level of crude oil production to preserve market share.",
        "The committee thus assessed that the global oil market had undergone a structural shift that would help limit the risk of oil price surge as seen during 2000-2011, and result in lower global inflationary pressure going forward.",
        "The changing circumstance led the MPC to reconsider the appropriate level for the midpoint of the inflation target for 2015.",
        "The MPC would seek consultation on the adjusted midpoint with the Minister of Finance before submitting it to the Cabinet for approval.",
        "In practice, the monetary policy framework and deliberation would remain the same regardless of the choice of The global economic recovery was weaker than previously assessed, and downside risks to growth in the euro area and Japan edged up.",
        "The US economy continued to expand on the back of private spending as a result of healthier balance sheets of the private sector and stronger labour market.",
        "Growth in Asia (excluding China and Japan) moderated somewhat, but sound economic fundamentals with improved labour markets and exports should provide an impetus for recovery going forward.",
        "China’s economy slowed primarily from decelerated investment; however, government’s measures should help sustain economic momentum, with economic reforms focused on long-term sustainability of growth.",
        "The euro area economies remained weak, with risks of a further slowdown, but the additional monetary and fiscal stimulus should lend some support to the economic recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "In Japan, economic growth was expected to rebound in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the Japanese yen depreciation would benefit exports.",
        "Looking ahead, Japan’s economy should recover slowly given lingering domestic structural constraints.",
        "Overall inflationary pressure diminished due to falling oil and commodity prices.",
        "Most central banks kept their policy rates unchanged.",
        "The People’s Bank of China, however, lowered the policy rate in order to support economic growth and help reduce the costs of corporate and state enterprise borrowing.",
        "The Thai baht weakened against the US dollar since the last meeting, in line with most major and regional currencies, due to stronger-than-expected US economic data and market expectation that the federal funds rate might increase sooner than previously anticipated.",
        "The Thai baht fluctuations remained moderate relative to those of regional peers.",
        "Nevertheless, global financial market volatilities increased in mid-December following a sharp fall in oil prices.",
        "It caused considerable currency depreciation in oil and commodity exporting countries, particularly Russia, and also weighed on global equity prices, including Thai equity indices.",
        "Government bond yields declined following market expectation of a possible MPC’s policy rate cut, more subdued inflation, and lower-than-expected government bond supply.",
        "Nevertheless, most market participants still expected the MPC to maintain the policy rate at this meeting, as reflected by relatively stable short-term interest rates and latest market opinion survey on policy rate action.",
        "The MPC discussed the current Russian economic headwinds and possible repercussion on the Thai economy.",
        "The committee highlighted key risks to the Russian economy, as follows: (1) The downward trend in oil price could affect oil export revenues, Russia’s main source of income; (2) Capital outflows and a considerable depreciation of the ruble could aggravate private sectors’ debt-servicing abilities for foreign currency debt; and (3) The Russian central bank’s drastic policy rate hike could exacerbate the economic slowdown.",
        "While the direct impact on Thailand was expected to be limited given the current level of trade linkages, the indirect impact through higher volatilities of both capital flows and exchange rates in emerging market economies could potentially pose risks to Thai financial markets.",
        "This and repercussion on the euro area, which has strong trade and financial linkages with Russia, warranted close monitoring.",
        "In the third quarter of 2014, the Thai economy recovered gradually at a rate close to projection.",
        "Private consumption expanded from households’ spending on non-durable goods and services.",
        "Private investment was higher than anticipated due to imports of equipments in the telecommunications and transportation sector.",
        "This helped offset lower-than-expected government spending, mainly as a result of low disbursement rate of state enterprises’ investment budget, as well as a slightly-slower-thanexpected recovery in exports of goods.",
        "In October, data pointed to a steady economic recovery.",
        "However, improving economic conditions were in part attributed to transitory factors such as a boost from exports to the euro area ahead of Thailand’s GSP tax privilege expiration and front-loading of government spending during the early period of 2015 fiscal year.",
        "Overall, the committee expected the economic recovery to progress at a slow pace, with a projected growth rate of 0.8 percent for 2014.",
        "In 2015, the economy should continue to recover at a rate of 4.0 percent, below formerly assessed, largely due to lower fiscal spending, which would cause further delay in private investment, and softer global demand growth compared to previous projection.",
        "The adjustment in expected fiscal impetus took into account limited capacity in government’s budget disbursement from recent track record.",
        "Expansion of private investment was adjusted downward accordingly, as most firms were expected to await greater clarity of public investment implementation.",
        "In addition, recovery in households’ spending on durables would be slower than previously expected, owing in part to weakening farm income.",
        "Nevertheless, private consumption should be buoyed by gradually improving non-farm income, an increase in government officials’ salaries and lower oil prices.",
        "Exports of goods were subjected to the more uncertain global economic outlook.",
        "Tourism was expected to turn more positive, but remained somewhat below the normal level.",
        "Headline inflation trended downward in line with domestic retail oil prices, and was expected to remain subdued in some periods ahead along with global oil prices.",
        "Core inflation slightly decelerated from more subdued demand pressure as the economy was slow to recover.",
        "Projection for inflation in 2015 was revised downward to 1.2 percent for both headline and core measures.",
        "Members actively discussed the prospects of fiscal stimulus in light of lower-than-expected public investment.",
        "Members broadly agreed that government agencies could further enhance the efficacy of budget disbursement, which if attained as originally planned should add more support to the economy.",
        "In this light, the committee would closely monitor the progress of fiscal spending going forward.",
        "Another issue of discussion was the impact on the Thai economy of global oil prices, which were projected to remain low for some periods.",
        "On balance, the economy should benefit from lower costs of production, but the already weak farm income might be worsened by a decline in agricultural commodities’ prices such as those of rubber and sugarcane.",
        "The committee assessed that the Thai economy should continue to recover in 2015, albeit at a slower pace than previously projected.",
        "Monetary policy was not hindering the ongoing recovery, and was consistent with long-term financial stability objective.",
        "Going forward, members agreed that monetary policy should remain accommodative in order to reinforce the momentum of economic recovery.",
        "Another important factor would be for the government to ensure that the disbursement of public spending goes as planned.",
        "Five members deemed maintaining the policy interest rate at 2.00 percent per annum as recovery in 2015, while fiscal stimulus should be the thrust of a more steady recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "Further policy easing might have a limited impact on growth, while potentially creating unintended consequences on financial stability.",
        "economy and financial markets.",
        "Two members voted to reduce the policy interest rate by 0.25 percent per annum for the following reasons: (1) Monetary policy should be eased further in order to lend more support to a weaker-thanexpected recovery, with growth staying below potential; (2) Higher downside risks to global economic recovery could undermine domestic economic growth, particularly at an early stage of recovery.",
        "A broad mix of policies should therefore be employed to strengthen the economy in preparation for external headwinds; and (3) Against the backdrop of low inflationary pressure, with a possibility of breaching the lower bound of the inflation target in 2015, monetary policy should play a greater role in supporting the economy and anchoring inflation.",
        "The committee thus voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy interest rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "The Thai baht depreciated since the last meeting, owing to the scaling down of asset purchase by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and domestic political situation.",
        "Following the Fed’s announcement in December and as the financial market shifted forward their anticipation of QE tapering, the baht depreciated in line with other regional currencies.",
        "Volatility subsequently picked up as domestic political situation intensified toward the end of 2013, and the baht depreciated against regional currencies.",
        "In 2014, the baht has stabilized within a narrow range, supported by long-term foreign investment flows and lower-than-expected US employment data.",
        "The government bond yields decreased since the last meeting, mainly driven by domestic factors.",
        "First, the ongoing political unrest has led to an expectation of a reduction in the policy rate at this meeting.",
        "In addition, the new issuance of government bonds related to the 2-trillion -baht public investment was expected to be further delayed after parliament dissolution.",
        "Since the beginning of 2014, non-residents have reduced their holdings of Thai debt securities, particularly long-dated ones.",
        "In their discussion of financial market developments, several members noted the relative stability of the Thai financial markets, and their resilience against both domestic and external shocks.",
        "This may have owed in part to advanced anticipation of QE tapering, as well as a stabilizing role of long-term investment inflows during the intervening period.",
        "Nevertheless, current domestic political situation and global financial market developments kept short-term uncertainties elevated, and market sentiments could change swiftly, warranting close monitoring.",
        "The policy framework in place remained appropriate in countervailing these risks.",
        "The global economy continued to improve, led by the major economies.",
        "The US economy expanded faster than expected, driven mainly by private consumption and investment, particularly in residential sector.",
        "Fiscal drag waned after the Congress passed the bill that allowed higher 2014 and 2015 budgets for the central government, while monetary policy was expected to be accommodative for an extended period.",
        "The euro area economies continued to grow on the back of manufacturing and exports of core member economies, together with gradually improving private confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, tight fiscal policies and slow progress in financial sector resolution would continue to impede economic recovery.",
        "The Japanese economy decelerated, but the manufacturing sector provided growth momentum on the back of accelerating private consumption before a consumption tax hike due in April.",
        "Exports should improve in tandem with trading partners’ growth and yen depreciation.",
        "The Chinese economy continued to recover, buoyed by trading partners’ more robust recovery, but the real estate sector and local government debts continued to pose risks to the economy.",
        "The Asian economies overall expanded well, with firmer export recovery in North Asia compared with that of Southeast Asian counterparts.",
        "The global inflationary pressure remained generally subdued, and most central banks have kept their policy rates unchanged.",
        "The committee agreed that the global economic outlook has improved, though several risks in major economies should be monitored: (1) Deleveraging process in the euro area has not completed and there has been limited progress in the resolution of fiscal and financial sector issues.",
        "Bank lending rates in crisis-affected countries such as Spain and Italy were still significantly higher than their peers’, while fiscal policy stances continued to tighten.",
        "Financial conditions were easing in some countries, but would take time to fully transmit to the real economy; (2) In China, financial stability risks stemmed from fragile real estate sector and large shadow banking debt relative to GDP, which has not been subject to rigorous regulation; and growth engine, with potential effects on sentiments that were harder to assess.",
        "Growth of the Thai economy in the fourth quarter of and for 2013 as a whole was expected to be lower than previous assessment, owing to a downward revision to both private consumption and investment.",
        "Exports has improved in most market segments and products, but could not compensate for a slowdown in domestic demand.",
        "Tourism has begun to see some impact from the political situation.",
        "Looking ahead, exports of goods should gradually improve in line with a moderate recovery in major economies.",
        "Nevertheless, private consumption would take longer to recover, due to more subdued consumer confidence and farm income.",
        "Private investment has been further delayed, amid uncertainties regarding economic recovery and political situation.",
        "Public spending and investment have been similarly postponed.",
        "Tourism could be more affected by prolonged political situation, but should quickly recover once the situation stabilizes.",
        "The Thai economy in 2014 was projected to expand less than previously assessed, with prolonged political situation posing further downside risks to private and public spending as well as tourism.",
        "The committee therefore revised growth projection for 2014 down, from around 4 percent to around 3 percent.",
        "Inflationary pressure overall remained subdued in line with domestic demand and world crude oil prices.",
        "The committee agreed that the downside risks to growth have increased substantially.",
        "Some members noted that any benefits of global growth pickup this year on Thai exports and tourism could be restrained by the ongoing political situation.",
        "Growth impact could be more pronounced if a prolonged unrest were to cause a switch of export orders to other countries, with potential knock-on effect on domestic spending.",
        "Members also discussed the degree to which the recent baht depreciation may have helped support the export sector by increasing their income in local currency.",
        "Many members saw the benefit of stable exchange rates amid currently uncertain economic environment and fragile private confidence.",
        "The MPC judged that the Thai economy was expanding at a slower pace than previously assessed, with greater downside risks stemming from the ongoing political uncertainties.",
        "During the policy discussion, the committee evaluated: (1) The need to maintain accommodative monetary policy given the current economic backdrop; (2) The effectiveness of further monetary policy easing, against potential costs and risks; and (3) The appropriate timing for additional monetary policy easing amid the prevailing high degree of uncertainties.",
        "The committee agreed on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy in order to support the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The majority deemed the underlying economic fundamentals to be robust, which should help the economy weather short-term risks from political uncertainties.",
        "Meanwhile, safeguarding financial stability remains a cornerstone for economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Four members voted to maintain the policy rate at 2.25 percent per annum, with the following rationales: (1) Monetary policy stance remained accommodative and appropriately supportive of economic recovery, as reflected by ample liquidity in the financial system and negative real policy rate; (2) Further easing of monetary policy was unlikely to provide a meaningful boost to private consumption and investment at the current juncture, given that political uncertainties were the main headwind to domestic demand at present.",
        "Instead, effectiveness of a policy easing could be confined to providing a temporary lift to asset prices; (3) Given still fluid political developments, there was a case for conserving the policy space and awaiting clearer economic assessment before considering further action; and (4) Against the backdrop of higher global financial market volatility stemming from QE tapering and market concerns about the emerging markets, financial stability should be given a high priority in monetary policy consideration, as it would provide a foundation for a sustainable recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Three members voted to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent from 2.25 percent to 2.00 percent per annum, as they saw a greater role for monetary policy in shoring up private confidence and supporting the economy, given noticeably higher downside risks to growth.",
        "These members deemed the risks associated with additional easing to be contained, as the inflationary pressure was subdued while financial stability risks were also manageable, as reflected by (1) decelerating private credit growth in line with economic slowdown; and (2) high level of international reserves to cushion potential capital outflows, while long-run demand for emerging market assets should still remain.",
        "Consequently, a greater weight could be put on supporting economic growth.",
        "The MPC thus voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 2.25 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC will closely monitor evolving developments, and stand ready to implement appropriate policy as warranted."

        "Advanced economies (AEs) would continue to recover in line with the previous projection.",
        "The Chinese economic expansion would moderate as a result of the zero-COVID policy which restrained consumption, together with the government’s measures to curb imbalances in the property markets which dampened investment.",
        "Asian economies would gradually recover on the back of higher exports, particularly exports of electronics products.",
        "Manufacturing production would expand in line with the continued recovery in global demand and some alleviation in global supply disruptions.",
        "Nevertheless, the outlook for the pandemic situations remained uncertain and would warrant monitoring going forward.",
        "In addition, the global economy would still face the risks from prolonged global supply disruptions and heightened geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine which could reinforce the elevation in energy prices.",
        "Global financial markets were highly volatile due to the anticipation of faster monetary policy normalization of AE central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve.",
        "Government bond yields in many countries rose in tandem with US Treasury yields, while risk asset prices fell.",
        "Movements of the Thai financial markets were in line with the global markets.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields increased.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term and medium-term bond yields were largely unchanged, consistent with the Thai policy rate outlook.",
        "On the exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar remained volatile, while the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated since the previous meeting.",
        "The relaxation of domestic COVID-19 containment measures contributed to upward pressure on the baht, while the prospects of faster policy normalization by the Federal Reserve exerted downward pressure.",
        "In the period ahead, financial market volatilities could increase.",
        "Key risk factors included Reserve, due to persistently high inflation, (2) uncertainties regarding the outbreak and mutations of COVID-19, and (3) geopolitical risks that could prolong the elevation of global energy prices.",
        "The Thai economy in 2021 would expand faster than previously projected, and the recovery would continue into 2022.",
        "This was driven by exports of goods especially automobiles, electronics parts, and electrical appliances, which improved in tandem with the recovering global demand and the easing of global supply disruptions.",
        "Furthermore, foreign tourist arrivals would increase due to the faster-than-expected relaxation of travel restrictions and the return of the ‘Test & Go’ scheme.",
        "However, the recovery would remain fragile and uneven across sectors.",
        "Private consumption in 2022 would continue to expand, but at a slower rate than previously assessed, as reflected by economic indicators that came out lower than expected toward the end of 2021.",
        "Meanwhile, income had not fully recovered especially for self-employed workers and service sector employees.",
        "The economy in 2023 would continue to expand but would slow down slightly from the previous projection.",
        "This would be partly due to the phasing-out of fiscal stimulus, especially the government consumption which was set to decrease under the Fiscal Year 2023 and 2024 budgets.",
        "Headline inflation in 2022 would be higher than previously assessed and could exceed the target range in the early part of the year.",
        "This would be owing to two particular sector-specific price increases.",
        "First, energy prices (12% share of the CPI basket) increased in tandem with world crude oil prices as a result of (1) the disputes among oil-producing countries, (2) increased demand for crude oil as concerns over the Omicron variant subsided, and (3) heightened geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Second, meat products and prepared food prices (9% and 15% share of the CPI basket, respectively) increased on the back of prices of pork due to the swine epidemic and would take at least ten months to be resolved.",
        "Nevertheless, the average inflation rate for the full year 2022 and medium-term expectations would remain within the target range.",
        "Furthermore, there had not been an indication of broad-based increases in the prices of goods and services.",
        "The proportion of domestic goods and services with above-average prices[1 ]for Thailand stood at 10% of the total basket, compared with that of the US at 35%.",
        "This was partly due to the strong economic expansion in the US, unlike the Thai economy.",
        "Going forward, the recovery of the Thai economy would remain fragile and subject to high uncertainties.",
        "Key risks to monitor included (1) the outbreak and mutations of COVID-19, - The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover, but the recovery would remain uneven across sectors and would take time to return to the pre-pandemic levels.",
        "In addition, uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 situation remained.",
        "Although the spread of the Omicron variant exerted limited pressure on the public health system, there remained a need to closely monitor efficacy of the vaccine and developments of the pandemic situations overall.",
        "COVID-19 containment policies in Thailand and abroad must also be monitored, as they would impact the prospects of foreign tourist arrivals and the recovery of tourism in Thailand.",
        "Domestic private consumption would be lower than previously assessed due to the spread of the Omicron variant and the phasing-out of government support measures.",
        "However, overall domestic consumption would continue to expand in 2023.",
        "The Committee viewed that there remained a need to monitor the inclusiveness of the recovery across sectors and the impact of higher living costs.",
        "These could derail private consumption recovery in the period ahead, given that income had not fully recovered and household debt remained high.",
        "- The Committee assessed that upside inflationary risks had increased and headline inflation could exceed the upper bound of the target range of 3% in early 2022.",
        "This was due to the rises in energy and raw food prices.",
        "The risk of a prolonged elevation in global energy prices increased primarily from geopolitical factors.",

        "The Committee viewed that the higher living costs from increased energy and raw food prices had affected households unevenly.",
        "Low-income households faced relatively larger increases in the living costs stemming from food expenditure compared with high-income households (the proportion of food expenditure in the low-income households’ and high-income households’ consumption baskets stood at 45% and 25%, respectively).",
        "Meanwhile, high-income households faced slightly higher increases in the living costs caused by rising energy prices compared with low-income households (the proportion of energy-related expenditure in the low-income households’ and high-income households’ consumption baskets stood at impact on self-employed workers and service sector employees whose incomes were slow to recover compared with other worker groups.",
        "- The Committee viewed that there remained a need to monitor the recovery of the labor market that was fragile and uneven, as well as risks to financial stability in the period ahead.",
        "The recovery of labor income would be slow for the next 1-2 years due to (1) slow tourism recovery, (2) employers limiting the hiring expansion during periods of high uncertainties pertaining to COVID-19 situations, and (3) a portion of workers returning to their home provinces or leaving the labor force permanently.",
        "Such factors delayed the recovery of the economy and the labor market going forward.",

        "Meanwhile, unlike AEs and EMs in Latin America, EM central banks in Asia had not faced high inflationary pressures and continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",
        "Monetary policy divergence could lead to volatilities in exchange rates and capital flows.",
        "However, the impact on Thailand’s financial markets was judged to be manageable due to strength on the external stability front, including large international reserves, and the fact that most businesses obtained funding primarily through banks that raised funds through domestic savings.",
        "Therefore, the Thai monetary policy could still pursue all three objectives of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover.",

        "The Committee assessed that the baht relative to the US dollar still exhibited volatile movements.",
        "This was due to faster-than-expected prospects of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, as well as better-than-expected Thai economic outlook owing to the relaxation of domestic containment measures.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",
        "The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.",
        "Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities.",

        "In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely, developments of the COVID-19 outbreak, global energy prices, higher cost passthrough, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "In the medium term, the Committee viewed that appropriate monetary policy should consider trade-offs between the objectives of price stability, economic growth, and financial stability in light of the changing outlook and risks.",
        "This should be deliberated in conjunction with the overall assessment of the interaction of monetary policy and other policy tools, as well as their effectiveness.",
        "At the current juncture, accommodative monetary policy reflected the assessment that risks and uncertainties to the economic growth continued to outweigh risks and uncertainties to other policy objectives.",
        "In the period ahead when the robust economic recovery resumed and the associated risks subsided, relative importance of policy objectives should be re-assessed to reflect the evolving situation, taking into account medium-term policy impact and effectiveness.",
        "Thailand's trading partner economies were projected to slow down, with growth for this year revised down from 4.0 percent to 3.6 percent.",
        "This was due to the impacts of sanctions against Russia.",
        "The sanctions resulted in higher energy and commodity prices, which worsened global supply disruption and led to rising inflation in most countries.",
        "However, as the Russian economy accounted only for 2 percent of the world economy, the direct impacts on the global economy were limited, with the exception of Europe which had strong economic linkages with Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Asian economies would recover at a slower pace due to higher energy prices which weighed on growth through higher living costs and production costs, but the impact would be limited.",
        "Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, the situation was improving in many countries and the impact of the Omicron outbreak on economic activities would be less than in previous waves.",

        "On the exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar remained volatile.",
        "In the early part of the first quarter of this year, the Thai baht had appreciated, mainly driven by the prospect of a tourism sector recovery.",
        "The baht then depreciated due to concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and expectations of policy rate hikes in advanced economies.",
        "However, the impacts on the Thai financial markets were largely muted thanks to strong external stability, reflected in a high level of international reserves and low external debt.",
        "In the period ahead, financial markets’ volatilities could increase.",
        "Key risk factors included (1) prolonged sanctions against Russia, which would push up energy prices and costs in the long run, and (2) faster-thanexpected policy rate hikes by major central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, in response to rising inflationary pressures.",
        "The Thai economy would continue to recover, expanding by 3.2 percent in 2022 and 4.4 percent in 2023.",
        "This would be driven mainly by improving domestic demand as well as a resurgence in foreign tourist arrivals, which were expected to reach 19 million in 2023.",
        "Meanwhile, negative shocks in recent periods have had a limited impact on the recovery prospect.",
        "The effects of sanctions against Russia would not derail the overall economic recovery path.",
        "The direct impacts on the Thai economy were limited since the value of exports to Russia in 2021 was only 0.4 percent of total exports and Russian tourists accounted for only 4 percent of total foreign tourists before the pandemic.",
        "However, the main impact on the Thai economy would be the indirect spillover effects on energy and commodity prices.",
        "These would result in higher costs of goods and living expenses, a dampened domestic purchasing power, as well as a slowdown in external demand.",
        "The impact of the Omicron outbreak on economic activities was expected to be more contained than previous waves.",
        "The public health system could still accommodate COVID-19 cases, and thus no stringent containment measures were expected.",
        "Downside risks to short-term growth increased.",
        "First, there could be prolonged shortages of raw materials in certain industries.",
        "In particular, commodities mostly produced by Russia and Ukraine could face more severe shortages, including pig iron, chemical fertilizers, wheat, and minerals used in the manufacture of automobiles and electronics.",
        "Second, households and businesses could be affected by higher living costs and higher production costs, particularly the vulnerable groups.",
        "Non-farm income was still below the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Furthermore, the ability of businesses in certain sectors to absorb rising costs had diminished, particularly those with large shares of fuel and commodities in their cost structure, including transportation, petroleum and chemicals, and construction.",
        "Headline inflation for the full year 2022 was expected to exceed the target range, reaching 4.9 percent, driven primarily by rising energy prices and the pass-through of food prices.",
        "Inflation could exceed 5 percent in the second and third quarters, mainly attributed to the low-base effect of crude oil prices and government assistance measures in 2021.",
        "Such effect would subside by the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "Headline inflation in 2023 was expected to decrease to 1.7 percent and return to the target range.",
        "This would be owing in part to the assessment that the rises in energy and food prices would not persist, and the global shortage of raw materials and commodities would ease.",
        "However, upside inflationary risks increased from (1) higher-than-expected oil prices if the Russia-Ukraine war and the sanctions against Russia exerted greater-than-assessed impacts on global oil supplies, and (2) higher-thanexpected cost pass-through to consumer prices, both directly and indirectly due to rising production costs and transportation costs.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation pass-through to wage rises was assessed to be limited due to a fragile recovery in the labor market and an uneven recovery across industries.",
        "Employment remained lower than the pre-pandemic level and might recover more slowly than in past crises.",
        "Overall, the Committee assessed that the rise in inflation was mainly due to cost-push price pressures.",
        "Even though the proportion of domestic goods and services with significant price increases picked up, this remained concentrated in energy- and food-related product groups.",
        "price increases rose from 9 percent in January 2022 to 13 percent in February 2022).",
        "Demandpull inflationary pressures remained subdued given that income had just begun to recover.",

        "The economy would continue to expand in 2022 and 2023 on the back of improving domestic demand and tourism.",
        "The overall recovery path would not be derailed by the Omicron outbreak and sanctions against Russia.",
        "Despite the Omicron’s high transmissibility, its mild symptoms helped shore up sentiment which lessened the impact on economic activities.",
        "Moreover, sanctions against Russia would have a limited direct impact on the Thai economy.",
        "On inflation, the recent increase was driven by supply-side factors that were expected to alleviate gradually.",
        "Headline inflation would decline and return to the target range in early 2023.",
        "Therefore, the Thai economic outlook did not meet the criteria for stagflation, which referred to an episode of a very low or negative growth together with continuously rising inflation.",
        "- The Committee expressed concerns that the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war might lead to global geopolitical tensions that pose uncertainties in the future.",
        "These would aggravate global supply chains that had yet to resume their pre-pandemic functioning or would reshape global trade and investment into blocs (deglobalization).",
        "Moreover, global supply chains and businesses’ investment decisions could be affected in the long run.",
        "- The Committee judged that the rise in Thailand’s inflation was in a different context from that of major economies, especially the US.",
        "The Thai economy was in a different stage of the business cycle compared with the US.",
        "For Thailand, the economy had just begun to recover and demand-pulled inflationary pressures remained subdued.",
        "For the US, the economy was expanding robustly.",
        "There were both cost-push and demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "The rise in private consumption and wages contributed to broad-based and persistent increases in prices.",
        "The Federal Reserve would therefore accelerate the pace of rate hikes to temper inflation arising partly from demand-pull factors.",
        "- The Committee noted that medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target range.",
        "This reflected confidence that monetary policy would continue to preserve medium-term price stability, similar to the 2008 episode.",
        "During that period, Thailand’s headline inflation rose to 5.5 percent in tandem with the rise in global oil prices which peaked at 140 US dollars per barrel.",
        "However, Thailand’s medium-term inflation expectations only displayed small increases.",
        "By contrast, Latin American economies which had a long history of grappling with hyperinflation saw medium-term inflation expectations rising in tandem with short-term inflation.",
        "In addition, Thailand had mechanisms to stabilize domestic prices, including the Oil Fuel Fund.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee considered that inflation dynamics would need to be closely monitored, including the dispersion and persistence of price increases, cost pass-through from producer to consumer prices, demand-pull inflationary pressures, and wage pressures, together with inflation expectations based on surveys and those implied from various sources.",
        "This would ensure that medium-term inflation expectations would be consistent with the monetary policy target.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the overall financial system remained stable.",
        "Some households and businesses, however, were more vulnerable as a result of higher living expenses and production costs, particularly low-income households and SMEs whose incomes were to fully recover and debt remained high.",

        "Average inflation for the full year 2022 would exceed the target range but was expected to decline and return to target in early 2023 with energy and food prices stabilizing.",
        "The Committee assessed those recent increases in inflation stemmed primarily from cost-push factors, while demand-pull inflationary pressures remained subdued.",
        "The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to help facilitate a sustained economic recovery.",
        "The Committee viewed that the baht had depreciated relative to the US dollar due to concerns over the Russia-Ukraine war and the expectation of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies.",
        "The Committee would therefore closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",
        "The Committee viewed that government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery amid heightened uncertainties.",

        "Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.",
        "Financial and credit measures had helped distribute liquidity and reduce debt burden, especially for those whose incomes had not yet fully recovered.",

        "At the current juncture, accommodative monetary policy reflected the assessment that risks and uncertainties to the economic growth continued to outweigh risks and uncertainties to other policy objectives.",
        "In the period ahead when the robust economic recovery resumed and the associated risks subsided, the Committee should re-assess the balance of risks between the policy objectives to reflect the evolving situation, taking into account medium-term policy impact and effectiveness.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to slow down, with growth revised down from 3.6 percent to 3.4 percent for 2022, and from 3.2 percent to 3.1 percent for 2023.",
        "This moderation in growth was mainly due to tighter financial condition in the US and the EU as central banks accelerated the pace of policy normalization to tackle rising inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian economies, particularly China, would continue to recover at the rate previously anticipated despite the zero-COVID measures imposed in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing during the second quarter of 2022.",
        "The containment measures so far have been more relaxed in several areas, and the new COVID-19 cases have started to drop, which resulted in the gradual recovery of the manufacturing and transportation sectors.",
        "Furthermore, better-than-expected outturns in the first quarter of 2022 and the likelihood of additional stimulus measures by the Chinese authorities further suggested that the Chinese economy would expand in line with the previous projection.",
        "Global inflation was expected to increase, as energy and commodity prices would remain elevated for longer than expected.",
        "This was mainly due to the prolonged sanctions against Russia, which resulted in global supply shortage of raw materials.",
        "Global financial markets were highly volatile due to concerns over rising inflation and monetary policy tightening in many countries, especially the aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in response to soaring inflation and tight labor market.",
        "Likewise, central banks in several other countries also signaled policy rate increases, particularly where economies have returned to pre-COVID levels and inflation has been above the central bank’s target.",
        "As a result, government bond yields in many countries rose while risky assets prices fall.",
        "For Thailand, short-term government bond yields increased in tandem with market expectations of policy rate hikes in Thailand, while long-term government bond yields increased along with US Treasury bond yields.",
        "On the exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar depreciated in line with regional currencies as the markets expected accelerating policy rate hikes in advanced economies.",
        "However, the relaxation of domestic containment measures and the better prospect of tourism with faster-than-expected border reopening since May helped to limit the depreciation of the baht.",
        "Key risk factors in the financial markets to be monitored included the pace of policy rate hikes by central banks in advanced economies and their impact on the global economy.",
        "The Thai economy would continue to recover, expanding by 3.3 percent in 2022 and 4.2 percent in 2023.",
        "This would be driven by, first, the recovery in private consumption that would continue to gain strength, especially in the services sector, as reflected in the better-thanexpected outturns in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Going forward, pent-up demand from high-income households would help support consumption.",
        "Second, foreign tourist figures would increase due to the accelerated relaxation of border controls in Thailand and other countries, the removal of the Test & Go scheme since the beginning of May 2022, as well as further plans to discontinue Thailand Pass for foreign tourists in July 2022.",
        "Third, the labor market and household income showed signs of improvements as economic activities continued to recover in tandem with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "The number of unemployment and underemployed workers has subsided and were close to pre-COVID levels; however, there remained a need to monitor whether labor who had left workforce during the COVID-19 would return to the labor market after the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "The Thai economy in 2022 could expand faster than previously expected owing to stronger domestic demand and the recovery of tourism sector, while the impact of COVID-19 on economic recovery has been limited as expected.",
        "However, the Committee would monitor key risks that could affect the economic outlook.",
        "First, prices of energy and commodity, particularly chemical fertilizers, and animal feed, could remain elevated for longer than previously estimated due to prolonged sanctions against Russia.",
        "Therefore, cost pass-through to households and businesses must be monitored going forward.",
        "Second, the Chinese economy could slow down because of the implementation of zero-COVID measures, which could impact trading partner economies and Thailand’s exports.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to stay above the target range for the full year 2022.",
        "Inflation forecast for 2022 increased to 6.2 percent due to a prolonged surge in global oil prices and domestic oil prices, together with higher cost pass-through that have spread into broader ranges of products.",
        "The rises in inflation have been primarily caused by cost-push factors.",
        "However, prices in the core inflation basket such as condiments and cleaning products started to increase as well.",
        "As a result, several underlying inflation indicators have trended upward, including core inflation excluding rents and government measures, trimmed mean CPI[1], and sticky price CPI[2].",
        "Inflation dynamics and cost pass-through thus warranted close monitoring in the period ahead.",
        "However, headline inflation would gradually decrease and return to the target range in 2023 in the baseline scenario as energy prices were not expected to rise further and cost pass-through would gradually diminish.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations have not significantly increased and were anchored to the target range of 1-3 percent despite a slight increase in short-term inflation expectations.",
        "Upside risks to inflation increased stemming from, first, oil prices that could remain elevated for longer than expected as the surges in global crude oil prices could be prolonged, while domestic oil prices could increase in tandem with refined oil prices in Singapore and the gradual reduction in oil price subsidies by the government’s Oil Fund.",
        "Second, domestic cost pass-through could be broader and faster than expected as businesses would be faced with simultaneous increases across various cost factors, including the impact of an increase in minimum wage that would gradually take off in 2023, and as businesses’ ability to bear rising costs would diminish especially those with low profit margins.",
        "Third, demand-pull inflation could accelerate as economic recovery gained momentum.",
        "leave only with CPI components that change price relatively infrequently.",
        "Increase in sticky price CPI reflects that price adjustments have broadened into products that rarely see price changes, and the overall price tend to increase.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the Thai economy in 2022 could expand faster than the baseline projection as a result of (1) domestic demand could be stronger than expected due to pent-up demand from high- and medium-income households, (2) foreign tourist arrivals that could improve more than expected following faster border reopening, and (3) the revival of income prospects for workers and businesses in the services sector following the recovery of tourism.",
        "Nevertheless, the Thai economic outlook in 2023 remained uncertain.",
        "Particularly, the risk of global growth slowdown led by advanced economies and China would impact Thailand’s trading partner economies and exports going forward.",
        "- The Committee assessed that upside risks to inflation increased.",
        "First, uncertainty about oil prices remained high in the period ahead as global crude oil prices could remain elevated for longer than expected as a consequence of prolonged sanctions against Russia, while oil-exporting countries might not significantly increase their production, and the demand for oil might pick up in tandem with global recovery.",
        "Second, domestic cost pass-through could be higher and faster than expected due to the simultaneous rises in costs for raw materials, energy, and labor costs.",
        "Increased price pressure has reflected in the increase in core inflation for broader ranges of products.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the balance of risks has shifted from the previous meeting, with risks to economic growth subsiding while risks to inflation increasing.",
        "Thus, a very accommodative monetary policy will be less needed.",
        "Meanwhile, an emphasis should be placed on monetary policy being flexible and agile in order to move in a timely manner.",
        "The Committee also saw a need to build policy space to be able to address possible future risks.",
        "- The Committee viewed that monetary policy deliberation should strike an appropriate balance between supporting economic recovery, preserving price stability, and safeguarding the overall financial system stability.",
        "The Committee came to an agreement on the following considerations.",
        "(1) High and elevated inflation would impede economic recovery.",
        "Rising inflation will lower the real incomes of businesses and households.",
        "Weakening purchasing power may undermine private consumption and economic recovery.",
        "Besides, persistently high inflation outturns could drive up inflation expectations, which may affect priceand wage-setting behavior of businesses and households.",
        "In the regime that inflation psychology has changed, it will become more challenging to bring inflation back to a low level.",
        "(2) With heightened inflationary risks, delaying the policy normalization could entail greater costs on the economy going forward.",
        "As the economy has started to recover and inflation is rising, maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance means greater loosening of monetary policy as the real policy rate declines.",
        "The additional monetary policy accommodation could exert upward pressure on demand-side inflation.",
        "Furthermore, in an adverse situation where inflation rises steadily to the point where inflation expectations of households and businesses become de-anchored, the policy rate will be forced to respond abruptly and aggressively to bring inflation down.",
        "Such a situation is undesirable because households and businesses would have to endure adverse impacts on their income, cost of living, and debt burden.",
        "Thus, policy normalization should be implemented at an appropriate timing and in a timely and gradual manner to avoid such tradeoff.",
        "(3) A gradual normalization of the policy rate will allow the economy to adjust smoothly, limiting the negative side effects on the overall economy and financial system.",
        "The Thai economic recovery has been on track, and the continued expansion will lead to income recovery which will act as a buffer against rising debt services for households and businesses in the future.",
        "In fact, the increase in debt services from a gradual rise in interest rate will be significantly less than the increase in the costs of living and the costs of businesses stemmed from inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, some vulnerable households and businesses—particularly the low-income group whose income have not fully recovered while debt burden remaining high—would be more sensitive to higher interest rates than the high-income group.",
        "The Committee viewed that targeted measures, such as debt restructuring, should be implemented to assist the vulnerable groups.",
        "These measures should be adjusted appropriately to help ease the debt burden of the vulnerable groups through different channels including commercial banks or specialized financial institutions.",
        "This would prove to be more effective than using monetary policy which is considered a blunt tool.",
        "The Committee voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.",
        "Three members voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover and tend to expand further than previously expected owing to strong domestic demand and the pickup in foreign tourists.",
        "Headline inflation would increase and remain elevated for longer than previously projected due to the increase in oil prices and higher cost pass-through.",
        "The Committee deemed that a very accommodative monetary policy would be less needed going forward.",
        "Four members voted to maintain the policy rate in this meeting to ensure that the recovery would continue to gain traction as anticipated.",
        "These four members would reassess the risks to growth and inflation going forward while emphasizing the need to communicate clearly to the public about the future course of monetary policy.",
        "Three members viewed that policy normalization is warranted in this meeting given the increased upside risks to both growth and inflation.",
        "The balance of risks has shifted from the assessment in the last meeting.",
        "Economic recovery would be supported by stronger-thanexpected pent-up demand and a pickup in foreign tourist arrivals.",
        "Meanwhile, the cost pass-through could be higher than initially anticipated, particularly pass-through of prices that affect core inflation.",
        "Since monetary policy would take time to have an impact on the overall economy and inflation, these three members deemed it appropriate to begin policy normalization in this meeting and to gradually increase in the policy rate going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that the baht has depreciated relative to the US dollar in line with regional currencies.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from the exchange rate volatility.",
        "The Committee emphasized the importance of targeted measures for vulnerable groups.",
        "The overall financial system remained resilient.",
        "Commercial banks had high levels of capital fund and loan loss provision.",
        "Liquidity in the financial system remained ample, although liquidity distribution still varied across economic sectors.",
        "Some groups of households and businesses remained vulnerable to rising living costs and production costs, as their incomes have not fully recovered while their debt burden remained high.",
        "The Committee deemed that debt restructuring in a sustainable manner to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability was still necessary, alongside a policy coordination with associated parties in preparing targeted measures for the vulnerable groups if needed.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, an appropriate monetary policy must aim at balancing the risks to each of these three objectives as they evolved, while considering the overall relationship and effectiveness of monetary policy together with other policy tools.",
        "In this meeting, the Committee assessed that the economic recovery has continued to gain more traction, while the upside inflationary risks continued to increase.",
        "Thus, the Committee deemed that a very accommodative monetary policy would be less needed going forward.",
        "The Committee will assess the appropriate timing for a gradual policy normalization in accordance with the shift in the outlook and risks surrounding growth and inflation, taking into consideration the effectiveness of monetary policy over the medium term.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to grow 2.9 percent in 2022, 2.5 percent in 2023, and 3.1 percent in 2024.",
        "The downward revision in 2023 was to reflect the weaker global demand given elevated inflation and the tighter global financial conditions due to restrictive monetary policy in several countries.",
        "Additionally, the Chinese economic slowdown due to the strict zero-COVID policy and the protracted stress in the real estate sector would undermine the business confidence and soften domestic demand in China.",
        "This would also affect Asian economies that were highly connected to China.",
        "In 2024, Thailand’s trading partner economies would pick up as the impact of high inflation on consumption would be lessened and financial conditions would be loosened.",
        "Global financial markets were volatile owing to expectations surrounding the Fed’s monetary policy stance.",
        "Investors expected the Fed to decelerate the pace of policy normalization as the US inflation started to subside.",
        "Risky asset prices rose while the US dollar depreciated.",
        "Emerging market economies started to see capital inflows.",
        "Short-term Thai government bond yields and commercial bank interest rates increased in line with the Thai policy rate.",
        "However, the overall financial conditions remained conducive for business financing in the private sector, as reflected in the growth in bank lending and bond market funding.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields decreased in tandem with US Treasury yields.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht appreciated against the US dollar in November owing to the market expectations that the Fed hikes would occur at a slower pace and that China would further relax the zero-COVID measures which would in turn benefit the Thai tourism sector.",
        "Looking ahead, the financial markets would still be subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Key risk factors included global growth and inflation outlook, the pace of monetary policy tightening by major central banks, as well as China’s exit strategy for zero-COVID measures.",
        "The Thai economy would continue to recover at 3.2 percent in 2022, 3.7 percent in 2023, and 3.9 percent in 2024.",
        "The recovery would be supported by, first, the tourism sector gaining more traction as the number of foreign tourists continued to increase in line with rising travel demand, improving airline capacity, and easing international travel restrictions.",
        "The numbers of tourist arrivals for 2022 and 2023 were revised upward by 1 million and projected to be at the tourists would come from ASEAN and other Asian nations.",
        "The forecast for Chinese tourist arrivals was on the lower side in 2023 as China’s reopening remained highly uncertain.",
        "Second, private consumption would continue to recover as economic activities improved, especially in the service sector.",
        "Private consumption was also supported by improvement in labor market conditions as indicated by the share of new unemployment benefit claimants that has fallen below the pre-pandemic level, suggesting higher incomes and a more broad-based recovery.",
        "Meanwhile, the global slowdown would affect Thailand’s merchandise exports, especially those sensitive to trading partners’ economic outlook such as automotives, textiles, electrical appliances, and manufacturing products.",
        "Nevertheless, exports of some products, such as agricultural and agro-manufacturing, would continue to expand.",
        "Overall, the tourism sector and private consumption would still be the key growth drivers and help lessen the impact of the global slowdown.",
        "The broad contour of Thai economic growth thus remained largely Headline inflation was projected at 6.3 percent in 2022 before declining to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.1 percent in 2024.",
        "Headline inflation peaked in the third quarter of 2022 and would return to the target range by the end of 2023.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation in 2023 would be higher than previously projected on the back of the upward adjustment of electricity charges due to elevated production costs.",
        "Core inflation projection was close to the previous assessment at 2.6 percent in 2022, 2.5 percent in 2023, and 2.0 percent in 2024.",
        "Core inflation started to stabilize in October 2022, with most prices largely unchanged or adjusted downward.",
        "This was due to the lower cost pass-through as compared to early-2022 in light of as those that had exited the labor force and migrant workers started to return to work, which helped lower wage pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would continue to closely monitor risks to growth and inflation, namely (1) the highly uncertain global economic outlook as the slowdown could be worse than expected, (2) the momentum of the recovery in the tourism sector, and uncertain.",

        "Major economies could undergo a more-severe-than-expected slowdown due to continued elevated inflation and restrictive monetary policy.",
        "China’s economic growth would decelerate and be subject to a higher degree of uncertainty as a result of the protracted stress in the real estate sector and the zero-COVID policy, which affected some parts of the manufacturing sector and the transport sector as well as consumer and business confidence in China.",
        "The Committee would thus monitor the developments of China’s zero-COVID policy in the period ahead as well as the effectiveness of the additional real estate measures in order to assess the impact on Thailand’s merchandise and service exports.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would continue to gain traction but there remained a need to monitor risks to key economic drivers in the period ahead.",
        "First, there remained risks to the tourism sector.",
        "The Committee viewed that China’s reopening would be highly uncertain and could affect the Thailand’s tourist arrivals in late-2023 and 2024.",
        "Nevertheless, most members viewed that risks remained tilted to the upside as foreign tourists could return in a greater number and earlier than expected.",
        "Key upside risks included pent-up travel demand, especially among Asian tourists that were highly dependent on domestic economy and were not sensitive to global economy, as well as easing airline capacity constraints and the potentially earlier-than-expected reopening of China.",
        "Second, there remained risks to private consumption even though it has continued to expand in the recent periods.",
        "Factors that could affect private consumption in each income group included changing consumption patterns, pent-up demand of middle- and high-income households, as well as the recovery of consumption among low-income households with incomes that have yet to fully recover, high debt burden, and higher sensitivity to rising living costs.",
        "- The Committee assessed that headline inflation would decline and return to the target range in the second half of 2023 but would remain subject to uncertainties regarding domestic energy prices in the period ahead.",
        "The fuel adjustment cost (Ft) would likely increase in 2023 to reflect the elevated production costs.",
        "However, the change in electricity charges remained uncertain and the impact on inflation would depend on government relief measures.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor the upward adjustment of electricity charges and the potential increase in cost passthrough.",

        "The financial positions of some households remained fragile from the impact of COVID-19 as their incomes had yet to fully recover.",
        "They were also faced with higher living costs and debt burden, which exacerbated household debt problems.",
        "In addition, a portion of household debt was owed to specialized financial institutions (SFIs) and non-banks.",
        "As such, public and private entities must all cooperate to tackle household debt problems in a targeted and holistic manner in order to safeguard long-term economic growth.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from The Committee viewed that the growth and inflation outlook were close to the previous assessment.",

        "The Chinese economy was projected to slow down due to its strict zero-COVID policy and fragile real estate sector.",
        "The Asian economy excluding China would continue to hold up with growth at around the same rate as previously assessed, since the impact of global slowdown would be offset by stronger domestic demand as the economy was in its early recovery phase.",
        "Global financial markets were volatile mainly due to the aggressive rate hikes in response to soaring inflation in many countries as well as concerns over recession.",
        "As a result, the US dollar had strengthened, and bond prices had increased, while prices of risky assets had fallen.",
        "Given the recession concerns, investors expected the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to slow down the pace of their interest rate hikes and might even have to cut the interest rates in 2023.",
        "The Thai bond market had become more stabilized as investors had clearer views on normalization path of Thai monetary policy.",

        "Long-term government bond yields had declined in tandem with US Treasury yields.",
        "The baht depreciated against the US dollar in line with most currencies.",
        "This was mainly attributable to aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and concerns over US economic recession.",
        "As such, investors were more cautious toward risky assets including emerging market assets and currencies.",
        "Nonetheless, Thailand’s portfolio flow movements were in tandem with other regional countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the financial markets would still be subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Key risk factors included monetary policy tightening by major central banks as well as inflationary pressures and growth outlook especially in advanced economies, as these would have implications on monetary policy conduct of central banks in the period ahead.",
        "The Thai economy would continue to recover and return to the pre-COVID level by the end of 2022.",
        "The main drivers included, first, the number of foreign tourist arrivals that had continued to increase and would be larger than expected.",
        "This was in tandem with growing travel demand and the relaxation of international travel restrictions in Thailand and abroad.",
        "Second, the recovery in private consumption would be stronger than expected especially for service consumption.",
        "This was consistent with the recovery in the tourism sector and continuous improvement in labor market conditions, as reflected in declining numbers of unemployment and underemployment as well as increasing non-farm incomes across all income groups.",
        "Third, merchandise exports in 2022 would be higher than expected both in terms of value and volume.",
        "This was owing to a smaller-than-expected impact of China’s containment measures on the Thai exporting sector, as well as gradual easing of supply chain disruptions.",
        "Merchandise exports in 2023 were expected to slow down in line with the growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners.",
        "Going forward, some sectors would experience a rapid recovery, especially tourism-related businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and commerce.",
        "As such, these businesses in some areas might face temporary labor shortages.",
        "There was also a need to monitor the growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners as this could affect Thai exports, especially in 2023.",
        "Headline inflation would remain at a high level throughout 2022, largely unchanged from the previous forecast.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to exceed the target range through the end of 2022.",
        "Price increases had been observed across a larger number of products but were still contained within food and energy categories.",
        "This was mainly due to direct cost pass-through of higher raw material and energy prices including meat, electricity charges, and liquefied petroleum gas.",
        "Cost pass-through to core inflation, especially to prepared-food prices, turned out to be greater than expected.",
        "As a result, short-term inflation expectations had edged up in line with rising living and production costs that households and businesses were facing.",
        "However, medium-term inflation expectations had not increased significantly and remained anchored within the target range of 1-3 percent.",
        "Headline inflation would gradually decline into the target range in 2023.",
        "This was attributable to subsiding supply-side inflationary pressures, given that energy and domestic retail oil prices would not increase further and that pork and palm oil prices would also fall.",
        "The inflation outlook would still subject to upside risks.",
        "Businesses could pass on more costs to consumers at a faster pace as they face simultaneous price increases in various inputs.",
        "In addition, demand-pull inflation could pick up as the economic recovery started to gain pace.",
        "At the same time, these upside risks would be partially offset by a potential decline in energy prices resulting from global economic slowdown.",
        "The Committee viewed that the risk of wage-price spiral would not be a major concern for Thailand compared to other countries because the labor market structure in Thailand differed from other countries in many aspects.",
        "First, the ratio of non-farm workers, or those who earn wages, in Thailand stood at 44 percent and was lower than the counterparts in advanced economies at 85-90 percent.",
        "Second, workers in Thailand could move across sectors quite easily.",
        "Migrant workers, the selfemployed, and workers who had left workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic could switch to work in the non-farm sector, although there might be some reluctance at first as workers might perceive the revenue stream to be unstable and not sufficient to cover urban living costs.",

        "In addition, according to information obtained from business contacts, some firms would be restrained from raising prices further.",
        "This was because they had already adjusted their prices and wages, while others might choose to bear increased labor costs given that demand had not fully recovered.",
        "- The Committee had confidence that the economic recovery would continue to gain traction on the back of improving foreign tourist figures while the global economic slowdown would have a limited impact on the Thai economy.",
        "The number of foreign tourist arrivals would primarily depend on the relaxation of international travel restrictions and the implementation of tourism promotion policy.",
        "These two factors would matter more than the economic growth of travelers’ country.",
        "Private consumption would continue to recover as well.",
        "Recovery in tourism would lead to improvement in incomes of businesses and workers in the tourism-related service sector which would in turn drive private consumption in the period ahead.",

        "In addition, geopolitical risks could cause significant impacts, although the possibility of such risks to materialize was low.",
        "- The Committee viewed that inflation risks were still substantial, mainly from the cost pass-through.",
        "Even though headline inflation would gradually fall due to declining energy and domestic retail oil prices following the global economic slowdown, cost pass-through to core inflation would persist for some time.",
        "This was owing to, first, concurrent price increases across various inputs.",
        "Second, changing production and global trade structures resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions could affect future inflation dynamics.",
        "This had been factored in into the core inflation forecast for 2023 which was higher than historical average.",
        "The Committee assessed that such cost pass-through would not lead to entrenched inflation.",
        "Going forward, upside risks to the inflation outlook could increase if rising short-term inflation expectations affect cost pass-through and price setting of businesses.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor potentially higher and faster cost pass-through as well as - The Committee noted that potential labor shortage could affect the economic recovery and create upward pressures on wages in some business sectors.",
        "Workers who had left workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic might have difficulty returning to the labor force owing to a lack of clarity on the upcoming relaxation of containment measures, high uncertainty surrounding their income prospects, as well as a lack of resources to start a new job.",
        "Furthermore, as e-commerce is growing rapidly, many workers have decided to become freelancers or work in delivery service companies since earnings from such jobs are higher than the minimum wages.",
        "This could create additional pressures on wages.",
        "The minimum wage increase and changing structure of the Thai labor market should thus be monitored going forward.",
        "- The Committee viewed that gradual rate hikes were consistent with the growth and inflation outlook.",
        "The Committee viewed that the economic recovery would continue to strengthen.",
        "Holding the policy rate at an extraordinarily low level to alleviate the COVID-19 impact had thus become less needed.",
        "Meanwhile, headline inflation would remain at a high level for some time.",
        "Cost pass-through, especially to items in the core inflation basket, must be monitored.",
        "Nonetheless, the recent rise in inflation was assessed to be mainly due to cost-push factors.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy rate should be normalized to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term, and that monetary policy normalization should be done in a gradual and measured manner consistent with the growth and inflation outlook in the period ahead.",

        "Meanwhile, Asian economies would decelerate in response to weaker global demand.",
        "China would grow at a slower rate given additional impacts on domestic demand following the strict zero-COVID policy imposed in many cities as well as protracted stress in the real estate sector.",
        "Global financial markets were volatile, driven by concerns over soaring inflation and restrictive monetary policy by several central banks.",
        "Most central banks placed more emphasis on tackling rising inflation which led to faster pace of rate hikes.",

        "This was due to, first, the number of foreign tourists that had continued to increase more than expected, with the number of tourist arrivals in 2022 being revised up to 9.5 million from 6 million thanks to growing travel demand and the relaxation of international travel restrictions.",
        "The number of tourist arrivals in 2023 was also raised to 21 million from 19 million, with most of them being Asian ex-China tourists.",
        "Second, private consumption would continue to recover especially service consumption, which had returned to the pre-pandemic level on the back of the recovery in the tourism sector.",

        "The baseline assessment has already incorporated, to a certain extent, factors that could give rise to inflation remaining elevated for a prolonged period of time.",
        "As such, the risks to the baseline inflation forecast were largely symmetric.",
        "On the one hand, inflation could be higher than the baseline projection due to several factors.",
        "First, cost pass- through could increase if businesses were to face rising cost pressure from multiple sources simultaneously.",
        "The Thai baht depreciation would also be monitored as it could exert additional pressures on businesses’ import prices.",
        "Moreover, demand-pull inflation could pick up in the period ahead as the economic recovery started to gain pace.",
        "Second, energy-related government relief measures, such as excise tax reduction or electricity bill subsidy, could end earlier or be less than expected.",
        "Third, labor market conditions could tighten as wages rise in some sectors and areas that had faced labor shortages.",
        "Although there have not been signs of a broad-based wage increase, risks from tight labor market conditions should be monitored in the period ahead, especially in some labor-intensive industries.",
        "On the other hand, inflation could also be lower than the baseline projection if energy prices were to decline more than the baseline assessment due to falling demand as a result of the global slowdown.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the economic recovery would continue to gain traction mainly on the back of tourism and domestic consumption.",
        "Global economic slowdown would have an impact on merchandise exports but would not derail the overall economic recovery.",
        "Inbound tourism could recover more strongly than expected thanks to further relaxation of international travel restrictions and Thailand’s tourism promotion policy.",
        "Also, tourism recovery should be relatively insusceptible to global recession as the recent inbound foreign tourist arrivals were mostly short-haul and premium travelers whose decisions to travel were not significantly affected by the economic conditions in their countries.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption was expected to continue recovering in a more broad-based manner, supported by the income improvement that had spread into the services sector and low-income households.",
        "As a result, this would be an important driver of private consumption in the period ahead.",
        "However, some members perceived that the global slowdown would be a risk that could affect Thai merchandise exports more than expected and would continue to closely monitor the outlook of global and trading partner economies.",
        "- The Committee viewed that inflation risks remained high and must be closely monitored, especially for core inflation.",
        "This was reflected in the rise in several categories of prices in core inflation due to higher and more widespread cost passthrough.",
        "Businesses could pass on costs further in the face of simultaneous price increases from multiple sources, such as raw material prices, oil prices, and wages.",
        "Such pass-through could affect inflation expectations and thus should be monitored along with inflation dynamics and inflation expectations in the period ahead.",
        "- The Committee noted that potential labor shortages in some recovering labor- intensive businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and construction, could create upward pressures on wages and limit the recovery in such businesses.",
        "Workers who had previously relocated still faced difficulty returning to the labor force, such as a lack of resources to start a new job in economic zones.",
        "Additionally, some Thai workers had switched to self-employed jobs with better pay in line with growth of e-commerce sector, which could cause labor shortages and wage pressures to continue for some time.",
        "Developments in the labor market and wage increases should thus be monitored in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, the increase in minimum wage in October 2022 had a limited impact on overall wages as most workers already earned more than the minimum wage.",
        "The knock-on effect on higher wages was hence limited.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the depreciation of the baht against the US dollar had been rapid and continuous due to the strengthening of the US dollar but was still in line with regional currencies.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) had only depreciated by around 2 percent since the start of 2022, indicating that the baht movements were in line with those of trading partner currencies and thus did not affect Thailand’s competitiveness.",
        "Also, there had not been any unusual capital flow movements, with Thailand’s capital flows still registering net inflows since the start of to accommodate volatilities in capital flows.",
        "Thailand’s international reserves were ranked the 12[th]-highest worldwide and amounted to more than 3 times the short-term external debt.",
        "Meanwhile, Thailand’s external debt was low at only 38 percent of GDP.",
        "Moreover, the recovery in the tourism sector would help reduce the current account deficit and curb depreciation pressure in the period ahead.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee was concerned that the rapid depreciation of the baht could create additional cost pressures for businesses and would accelerate more cost pass- through.",
        "This would in turn affect inflation and therefore developments in the foreign exchange market should be closely monitored, especially in the period of - The Committee deemed that gradual and measured policy normalization remained an appropriate stance of monetary policy and would be ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment.",
        "The gradual policy normalization was consistent with the current growth and inflation outlook due to the followings: (1) The economic recovery continued to gain traction and was more broad-based, both in terms of business sectors, especially services, and in terms of income distribution.",
        "As a result, the Thai economy was ready to accommodate a gradual normalization to the level that would be consistent with sustainable growth in the long term.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was close to the previous assessment, driven mainly by supply- side and global factors which would subside in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, the risks to core inflation increased, mainly due to cost pass-through.",
        "Nonetheless, demand-pull inflationary pressures were still limited as the Thai economy was still in the early stage of recovery.",
        "Moreover, the wage-price spiral risks remained limited as non-farm workers, or those who earn wages, accounted for only 44 percent of total workers in Thailand, compared to 85-92 percent in the United States, Germany, and the UK.",
        "Thailand’s labor supply was also more elastic than that of other countries.",
        "Workers in Thailand could move quite easily across sectors in response to changing demand in different situations.",
        "(3) There remained vulnerabilities in some businesses and households, especially SMEs in some sectors that had yet to fully recover and low-income households that were sensitive to the rising living costs who would be affected by aggressive policy rate hikes and could in turn derail the recovery.",
        "The Committee thus viewed that a gradual policy normalization should be done in conjunction with targeted measures and sustainable debt solutions to support vulnerable groups.",
        "Notwithstanding, should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment, the Committee would be ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization accordingly.",
        "For example, if the economy could recover faster than expected or inflation could persistently rise from demand-pull pressures, the Committee could consider raising the policy rate by more than 0.25 percentage point.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee could consider temporarily halting the hikes to await clarity should more uncertainties ensue in the period ahead, such as if the global economy were to slow down by more than currently assessed.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from The Committee viewed that the Thai economic recovery would continue to gain traction, mainly driven by tourism and private consumption.",
        "The tourism sector recovered better than expected from the continued increase in the number of foreign tourist arrivals.",
        "Moreover, the economic recovery was more broad-based, both in terms of business sectors, especially services, and in terms of income distribution.",
        "Headline inflation remained at a high level as cost pass-through had increased in recent periods, despite declining global oil prices and subsiding supply chain bottlenecks.",
        "Core inflation increased mainly due to higher cost passthrough.",
        "Nonetheless, demand-pull inflationary pressures were still limited as the Thai economy was still in the recovery stage, while signs of a broad-based wage increase were not yet observed.",
        "However, there remained a need to closely monitor risks to inflation.",
        "The overall growth and inflation outlook remained largely unchanged from the previous assessment.",

        "Having evaluated proposals by real estate sector representatives, conveyed via the Ministry of Finance, to loosen the current LTV measures to boost activities in the sector, the Committee deemed the likely increased risks to financial stability to outweigh any short-term benefits: (1) The current LTV measure in Thailand remained conducive to housing affordability for the vast public majority, with nearly 90 percent of buyers being unconstrained by the LTV criteria and able to obtain loans at 100 percent of property values without down payment.",
        "The current LTV measures in Thailand, at 90-100 percent for first residential properties, were already lax relative to other countries: e.g.",
        "comparable LTV in South Korea, Singapore, and New Zealand were at 50-70, 75, and 80 percent, respectively.",
        "(2) Housing market activities continued to expand, with rising sales and property transfers.",
        "Supply was recovering, with a higher number of new residential properties for sale.",
        "Improving real estate business confidence index indicated an outlook of steady growth, and (3) LTV loosening could pose risks to financial stability, through increased speculative activities in the real estate sector that push up prices in some segments and overborrowing by some buyers.",
        "The ongoing deleveraging process could thus be disrupted, with implications for financial system’s fragilities in the longer-term.",
        "- The Committee recognized the particularly severe impacts of higher interest rates on vulnerable groups such as less profitable small businesses and highly indebted households.",
        "The Committee thus supported sustainable debt solutions, particularly measures requiring financial institutions to provide targeted debt restructuring offers including through the “Responsible Lending” initiative.",
        "Such targeted measures should be more effective in alleviating the impacts on the vulnerable groups, with less cost to macrofinancial stability than the use of a blunt tool such as the policy rate.",
        "- Most Committee members agreed that maintaining the policy interest rate at the current neutral level would help promote sustainable economic growth, which would require financial stability as a key pillar.",
        "Their rationales included: (1) The recent growth slowdown had mainly external and structural causes, while domestic demand continued to expand; (2) An interest rate cut at this juncture would likely do little to spur growth given already robust domestic demand.",
        "At the same time, any monetary easing cannot resolve structural impediments, a key root cause of lackluster growth.",
        "The benefits for utilizing valuable policy space appeared limited.",
        "(3) More evident structural issues and possibly lower potential growth could have implications for the neutral interest rate level, but such impact remained highly uncertain and would likely be quantitatively small.",
        "More incoming data and further investigation would be warranted to shed more light on the link.",
        "(4) The costs to macro-financial stability associated with overly expansionary monetary policy remained a notable concern.",
        "With monetary policy working by stimulating credit, policy easing could forestall the ongoing deleveraging process and keep debt levels elevated.",
        "Moreover, undue monetary policy easing could intensify search-foryield behavior, lessen incentives to engage in productivity-enhancing activities, deter necessary resource reallocations, and further add financial fragilities to the system.",
        "These members nonetheless highlighted the need for policy to be flexible and attuned to the evolving growth and inflation outlook and associated assessments.",
        "Two members voted to cut the policy rate.",
        "In their views: (1) The level of neutral interest rate may have significantly declined from lower potential growth rate amid intensifying structural impediments; and (2) A more accommodative policy stance, despite having limited impact on growth, could help mitigate the downside risks to the economy, particularly if slowerthan-expected recovery in export and related manufacturing were to affect employment conditions and put at risk the sustainability of private consumption.",
        "The Committee voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.",
        "Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point.",
        "In the Committee’s judgment, the economy overall was expected to slow in 2024, weighed by exports and manufacturing activity amid weak global demand and intensifying structural factors.",
        "Domestic demand continued to expand and remained a key engine of the economy.",
        "Inflation stayed at a low level due to supply factors and was expected to gradually pick up to the target range at a slower-than-expected pace.",

        "Smaller and less profitable businesses as well as highly indebted households however may face higher debt interest burdens relative to others.",

        "Trading partner economies continued to expand, with projected growth rates of 2.6 and 2.7 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.",
        "However, the implication for global trade is expected to be limited.",
        "One reason was that key global growth drivers such as the US economy continued to grow on the back of the services sector.",
        "Meanwhile, the Chinese economy continued to be restrained by lingering problems in the property sector.",
        "At the same time, Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, coupled with its weak domestic demand, have led to an influx of goods into global markets, putting pressure on merchandise exports and production in various countries.",
        "Furthermore, the recovery of the global electronic cycle remains concentrated in high-tech products, leaving certain Asian countries yet to fully benefited from the export of electronic components.",
        "Global risk sentiment has been improving, driven by the continued expansion in the global economy, as well as the decline in global inflation.",
        "Consequently, risky asset prices and capital flows into regional economies picked up.",
        "However, investors expected the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts until the middle of the year due to slower-than-expected disinflation, resulting in the appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to expand by 2.6 and 3.0 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, supported by (1) an improvement in the tourism outlook in terms of both the number of foreign tourists and spending per head, with the expected number of tourist arrivals of 35.5 million and 39.5 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively; (2) continued growth in private consumption, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the previous year.",
        "This growth is mainly driven by services consumption and expenditures of high-income groups; and (3) an acceleration of public expenditure in the remainder of the year, following delays in government budget disbursement.",
        "Meanwhile, the recovery of exports of goods and manufacturing is anticipated to be gradual in the second half of this year.",
        "The outlook for the Thai economy remained uncertain, with key downside risks including a slower-than-expected recovery in exports due to oversupply concerns and Thailand’s structural headwinds, as well as uncertain impacts of government budget disbursement and fiscal stimulus measures.",
        "Headline inflation stayed at a low level but should gradually increase towards the target range by the end of the year, with the projection of 0.6 and 1.3 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.",
        "Core inflation was expected to stay at 0.6 percent in 2024 and 0.9 percent in decline in prices of certain raw food items such as vegetables and pork due to excess supply; and (2) the decrease in energy prices owing to an extension of government subsidies.",

        "Key risks to monitor include geopolitical tensions that could increase global energy prices and potential changes in government subsidies, which could impact domestic energy prices.",

        "Structural impediments, particularly deteriorating competitiveness in the exports and manufacturing sectors, alongside global excess capacity driven by Chinese production, could limit the benefits of the global economic recovery on the Thai economy.",
        "However, the Thai economy is projected to grow in 2024 at a higher rate than observed in the previous year.",
        "The average of this year’s quarter-on-quarter growth rates is estimated to average around 1.0 percent which is relatively high compared to historical averages.",
        "This is supported by improvements in cyclical factors, especially on tourism and government expenditure in the remainder of the year.",
        "At the same time, the strain from unusually high inventory levels is expected to ease.",
        "Nevertheless, the outlook for the Thai economy remained highly uncertain, contingent on (1) export recovery; (2) the impact of government spending which would depend on disbursement in the remaining part of the year; and (3) the government’s economic policies going forward.",

        "Price declines have been observed in specific categories such as raw food and energy, rather than being broad-based.",
        "Meanwhile, overall prices in core inflation have continued to rise, and medium-term inflation expectations remain in the target range.",
        "The Committee recognized that the current inflation rate being close to the lower bound of the target range is not a concern, as it was mainly driven by supplyside factors and was not indicative of demand deficiency.",
        "Additionally, it has helped contain households’ cost of living which had surging previously.",
        "However, the Committee observed that prices of certain goods and services which are the important components of the consumer price index (CPI), such as housing rents, transportation, and communication costs, have shown relatively little movements for an extended period.",
        "The Committee recommended further analysis to ensure that inflation and the households’ cost of living align with current developments.",

        "In addition, SMEs were facing difficulties in financial access.",
        "However, overall financial conditions remained conducive to ongoing economic expansion as reflected from (1) private sector funding costs via commercial banks and corporate bond markets remained stable coinciding with the policy interest rate since September 2023; (2) Businesses and households continued to obtain new credits, amid the moderation of total loan outstanding owed mainly to repayments; and (3) businesses and households overall have been able to service debts normally.",
        "The outstanding of non-performing loans (NPLs), such as auto loans, gradually increased following a period of accelerated credit granting, but a surge is expected to be unlikely.",
        "- The Committee expressed concern over elevated household debt and recognized the importance of debt deleveraging.",
        "The high level of debt outstanding could hinder longterm economic growth, especially if debt does not contribute to future income or wealth accumulation.",
        "Recognizing the need to address household debt effectively, the Committee highlighted the importance of creating jobs, enhancing income for households, providing loans that align with borrowers’ repayment capacity, as well as initiatives to accelerate targeted measures, particularly Responsible Lending measures, which would be more effective with fewer unintended consequences than resorting to the policy interest rate.",
        "- The Committee recognized that the baht’s volatility when measured against the US dollar increased and depreciated more relative to other regional currencies.",
        "This is due to external factors, where Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook plays an important role, as well as domestic economic and financial developments such as lower-thanexpected economic outturns and fluctuations in gold prices.",

        "Their rationales are as follows.",
        "First, despite the decline in Thai economic growth, partly owing to structural headwinds, the current level of interest rate remains broadly neutral.",
        "Second, the current level of the policy interest rate is supportive to continuous debt deleveraging.",
        "Although a reduction in the policy interest rate could mitigate debt burdens in short term, it would encourage additional borrowing, leading to higher debt outstanding.",
        "This could jeopardize macrofinancial stability and hinder long-term economic growth.",
        "Third, the current level of the policy interest rate is robust to the uncertain economic outlook and baht’s volatility.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee stands ready to adjust the policy interest rate should economic conditions warrant, especially in the event of significant changes in the export’s recovery path, government spending, and government economic policies.",
        "Meanwhile, two members voted to cut the policy interest rate to (1) be consistent with the lower potential economic growth as structural headwinds have become more apparent; and (2) help alleviate the burden on debtors somewhat, particularly SMEs and low-income households.",
        "Moreover, the two members judged that lowering the policy interest rate to align with economic potential would not significantly hinder debt deleveraging.",
        "The Committee voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.",

        "Looking ahead, private consumption should continue to expand on the back of improving employment and household income, as well as positive readings of the consumer confidence in the high-income group; and (3) an acceleration of government disbursement in the second quarter after the passage of the 2024 budget.",

        "Meanwhile, core inflation was forecasted at 0.5 and 0.9 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.",
        "Inflation turned positive, in line with expectations, partly from the low-base effect of energy prices.",
        "Nonetheless, inflation was expected to be below the target range in the third quarter before gradually increasing towards the target range from the fourth quarter this year.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to increase as the effects from the diesel price subsidy and the excess supply of certain raw food items started to phase out.",

        "- The Committee assessed risks to the Thai economy to become less tilted to the downside, as reflected in higher-than-expected outturns of private consumption and investment in the first quarter, an acceleration in government disbursement during the second quarter, and a continued recovery in the tourism sector.",
        "However, the Committee expressed concerns over the K-shaped economic recovery, particularly the subdued improvements in exports and manufacturing, with increasing pressures arising from: (1) structural headwinds and deteriorating competitiveness that have limited the benefits of the global economic recovery on the Thai economy; and (2) external factors such as oversupply of goods resulting from Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, along with additional risks to other merchandize goods including those in the automotive sector due to a slow recovery in global demand, and risks to solar cells manufacturers resulting from trade measures between the US and China.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee expressed concerns over the divergence in the recovery of household incomes, as some low-income households face higher debt burdens while income recovers only slowly.",

        "- The Committee assessed headline inflation to gradually increase towards the target range.",
        "The low inflation readings since the middle of 2023 were partly due to the government subsidy program, which is scheduled to be gradually phased out in 2024 following the increased ceiling of diesel prices.",
        "Some Committee members believed there remained inflationary risk due to geopolitical tension and the minimum wage hike.",
        "However, the Committee deemed the current inflation target of 1 to 3 percent robust in anchoring medium-term inflation expectation, which have remained at around 2 percent in recent years, contributing in part to the reduction of inflation from its peak of around 8 percent in August 2022 back to the target range within 7 months.",
        "- The Committee recognized the need to sustainably address the elevated household debt by supporting the Bank of Thailand and relevant authorities to collectively tackle the issues.",
        "The high level of household debt will hinder long-term economic growth and leave households with fewer buffers against future risks.",
        "The Committee agreed that the ongoing debt deleveraging should continue, alongside the Bank of Thailand’s measures aiming to align bank lending practices with borrowers’ debt repayment capacity and to facilitate debt restructuring for debtors with repayment difficulties.",
        "Programs in place include a restructuring initiative accessible to debtors experiencing initial difficulties, prior to classification as non-performing loans (NPLs), as well as those already classified as NPLs.",
        "Furthermore, a program is established to resolve persistent debt by converting high-interest revolving personal loans into lower-interest installment loans with terms and conditions enabling debtors to repay within 5 years.",
        "- The Committee acknowledged that some groups of SMEs have faced difficulties accessing credit and coping with high borrowing costs.",
        "However, the root cause of such issues stemmed from borrowers’ credit risks and lenders’ limitations in assessing the risks of smaller firms, all of which cannot be addressed solely through monetary policy.",
        "Therefore, the Committee has advocated for targeted measures, such as credit guarantee schemes, as a more appropriate approach to reducing credit risks for financial institutions and facilitating greater loan approvals for SMEs.",

        "Risk sentiments in the global financial markets improved as US inflation clearly declined and due to the faster-than-expected China’s reopening.",

        "Second, private consumption would gain further traction propelled by improvements in employment and labor income in the services sector and among self-employed workers, which accounted a significant share of total employment (approximately 18.4 million or 67% of total non-farm workers in 2022).",

        "Second, tourism recovery could increase demand-side inflationary pressures and result in an increase in prices of tourism-related goods and services, including food prices.",
        "The Committee would therefore continue to closely monitor risks to inflation.",

        "Tourism sector would be a key economic driver this year, while growth momentum from merchandise exports would moderate from the previous year.",
        "Tourism recovery would support economic activities in the services sector as well as contribute to a more broad-based improvement in employment and income of services sectors and selfemployed workers, which accounted a significant share of total employment.",
        "Such improvements would foster a stronger economic recovery given that higher purchasing power of households would result in multiplier effects on private consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, there were risks of rising demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "The Committee would thus monitor Chinese tourist arrivals, which could return in a greater number and earlier than expected, as well as the risks of labor shortages in the services sector which could temporarily put pressure on wages in related businesses.",
        "Furthermore, some members were concerned that the economy’s reliance on the tourism sector as the only key economic driver might have implications for the sustainability of economic growth in the long term.",
        "- The Committee expressed concerns over the effects of structural changes on Thailand’s merchandise exports outlook.",
        "Although merchandise exports were expected to moderate in 2023, partly due to the global slowdown, most members viewed that Thai exports going forward would benefit from both the recovery in advanced economies and China’s reopening.",
        "Therefore, the deceleration in merchandise exports that coincided with the economic cycle was not of major concern.",
        "However, the Committee was more concerned on the shifting structures of both global and Thai economies which would affect Thailand’s merchandise exports.",
        "These changes included, for example, (1) shifts in global supply chains due to deglobalization, circulation strategy which would affect Thai exports of petroleum and chemicalrelated products, and (3) a slow adjustment in Thailand’s manufacturing sector in response to technological changes, such as the rising adoption of solid state drives, which affected Thai exports of hard disk drives.",
        "These structural changes would have implications not only for the monetary policy but also for macroeconomic policies aimed at uplifting the long-term potential growth of the Thai economy.",
        "- The Committee assessed that inflationary risks had increased and warranted close monitoring.",
        "Core inflation was expected to remain at a high level for some time as there remained risks of a potential increase in pass-through given elevated costs, while some production costs remained high, such as domestic energy prices, which might decline to a lesser degree than global prices due to the contribution gradually allocated to the Oil Fuel Fund.",
        "Moreover, businesses could increase prices of goods and services in the period ahead in response to rising households’ purchasing power in line with the economic recovery.",
        "The committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor demandside inflationary pressures and businesses’ price adjustment behavior, as well as inflationary psychology which might have changed from the past and could in turn affect the medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "- Some members remained concerned over the financial positions of the vulnerable groups, especially SMEs and low-income households.",
        "Although improvements in the tourism and services sectors would support the income recovery, those vulnerable groups had high debt burden and had been facing the rising living costs.",
        "Meanwhile, benefits from the tourism recovery might concentrate in some popular tourist destinations and among workers in tourism-related businesses.",
        "Furthermore, labor incomes in some sectors, such as the export-related manufacturing sector, might be affected by a slowdown in merchandise exports this year.",
        "Therefore, the Committee saw the need to monitor the income recovery and financial positions of the vulnerable groups.",
        "Moreover, debt restructuring should be pressed ahead in order to ease debt burden in a targeted manner, which would be more effective than using the monetary policy which was considered a blunt tool.",
        "- The Committee judged that gradual and measured policy normalization was an appropriate course for monetary policy while standing ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment.",
        "Gradual increases in the policy rate caused financial conditions to tighten in a slow and orderly manner.",
        "This led bank lending and corporate bond issuances to continue expanding, as well as helped ease impacts on debt burden of the vulnerable groups to some extent.",
        "However, monetary policy would face greater challenges in the period ahead.",
        "Monetary policy would face a tradeoff between tackling inflation amid rising demand-side inflationary pressures on the back of the improving economic outlook and supporting the economic recovery where some businesses and households remained fragile.",
        "The committee would be ready to adjust monetary policy to be consistent with the changing economic and inflation outlook.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would continue to recover.",
        "Tourism and private consumption would continue to gain traction thanks to the return of Chinese tourists.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports would slow down this year but were expected to improve in 2024 in line with the global economic recovery.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to decline, whereas core inflation would remain high for some time with the risks that it would remain high for longer than expected owing to demand-side inflationary pressures and a potential increase in pass-through.",

        "However, bank lending and bond issuances continued to increase.",
        "The baht against the US dollar had appreciated owing to expectations of a dovish Fed tightening as well as China’s relaxation of international travel restrictions which would benefit the Thai tourism sector.",
        "The Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the financial market and volatilities in the Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judged that Thai economic recovery remained on track.",

        "Asian economies, which recently experienced an export downturn, were expected to recover in line with China and the global economy.",
        "However, the global economic outlook grew more uncertain from persistently high inflation and tighter global financial conditions following episodes of banking stresses in some AEs.",
        "Depending on how these developments unfold, there could be implications for monetary policy and the global economy.",
        "Uncertainty about the Fed and ECB’s monetary policy outlook kept volatilities in global financial markets high.",
        "Contributing to this uncertainty were persistently high inflation and increased financial stability risks from banking stresses in some AEs during March 2023.",
        "As a result, bond yields in most countries declined, while risky asset prices fell along with increased capital outflows from emerging market economies.",
        "However, the impact from these banking stresses on the Thai financial system so far had not been significant, as the Thai financial institutions and corporations had limited linkages with the troubled banks and risky assets.",
        "Moreover, Thai financial institutions continued to maintain high levels of capital.",

        "The baht fluctuated against the US dollar, driven by the Fed’s uncertain policy outlook and increased financial market volatility induced by banking stresses in AEs.",
        "The Thai economy was expected to continue expanding, driven mainly by recovery in the tourism sector, which should, in turn, boost labor income and private consumption.",
        "Growth projection for 2023 and 2024 was 3.6 and 3.8 percent, respectively, supported by several factors.",
        "First, the tourism sector continued to recover robustly, with the number of foreign tourists picking up across most source countries.",
        "Tourist arrivals were expected to reach 28 million and 35 million for 2023 and 2024, respectively, an upward revision from the January assessment of 25.5 million in 2023 and 34 million in 2024.",
        "Second, improving employment and labor income, especially for the service and self-employed sectors which benefited from tourism recovery, should help support private consumption.",
        "Third, merchandise exports started to rebound after contracting in the last quarter of 2022 and should gather momentum in the second half of 2023 consistent with trading partners’ growth.",
        "Nevertheless, certain merchandise exports could recover more slowly than others, including electronics whose global demand was undergoing a cyclical downturn, and petrochemical which was affected by China’s dual circulation strategy.",
        "Overall, the risk to Thai economic growth was tilted to the upside from the number of foreign tourist and their spending which could exceed expectations.",
        "The Committee, however, noted the downside risks from highly uncertain global financial and economic outlook.",

        "In most members’ assessment, there were upside risks to growth in 2023 from stronger-than-expected tourist arrivals and associated boost to labor income and domestic demand.",
        "Merchandise exports could similarly recover faster than expected, especially if banking stresses in AEs were contained and left limited broader impact on the global economy.",
        "Nonetheless, the Committee would monitor the global outlook given increased downside risks.",
        "- In the Committee’s view, upside risks to inflation remained given a potential increase in pass-through of costs absorbed in the past.",
        "Some production costs were still persistently high, in part as increased contribution to the Oil Fuel Fund capped downward adjustments in the domestic energy prices.",
        "Businesses could moreover raise prices of goods and services in anticipation of rising households’ purchasing power and stronger economic recovery.",
        "The Committee discussed the possibility of inflation staying elevated longer than historically the case, owing to the same structural changes impinging on the global inflation.",
        "These included technology transformation, deglobalization and green transition.",
        "The Committee agreed to closely monitor firms’ pricing behavior and demand-side inflationary pressures, as well as potential changes in inflation dynamics which could affect medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "- The Committee remained concerned over the financial positions of the vulnerable groups, especially SMEs and low-income households.",
        "Despite the recovery observed, labor income in some sectors remained below the pre-Covid levels and insufficient to cover increased expenses and debt servicing costs.",
        "The Committee deemed it important to still have in place financial support measures, particularly debt restructuring, with a comprehensive coverage for vulnerable households to resolve their debt problems in a sustainable and targeted manner.",
        "- The Committee agreed on a continued policy normalization to lessen the risk of inflation staying persistently above the target range.",

        "Nonetheless, Asian exports were expected to improve and recover in the second half of 2023.",

        "Underlying inflation indicators remained high despite some slowdown, while core inflation was driven importantly by the food-in-core components which have been persistent in their ascent.",
        "The upside risk of inflation could come from two factors.",
        "First, demand pressures could mount given the backdrop of expanding economic activities, particularly if tourism recovery or fiscal stimulus under the new government’s economic policies proved stronger than expected.",
        "Second, the pass-through of costs absorbed by producers in the past could increase given persistently high production costs.",
        "In this context, further supply pressures could have implications for price-setting behavior.",
        "On the downside, new government subsidies of living costs and slower-than-expected global recovery could weigh on inflation.",

        "Cost pass-through could increase as businesses sought to raise prices in light of stronger household demand on the back of economic expansion and possible fiscal stimulus.",
        "Over the long term, climate change would put pressure on raw food inflation, making it higher and more persistent.",
        "For example, the El Niño phenomenon would exacerbate and prolong droughts, raising prices of vegetables and fruits.",
        "In addition, higher costs of animal feed and fewer farmers could result in higher prices for meat, especially pork.",

        "The possible minimum wage increase in particular could prompt a higher pass-through of labor costs onto the price of goods.",
        "Indexing the minimum wage to inflation could further amplify the pressure on labor costs and goods prices, possibly giving rise to a wage-price spiral phenomenon with implications for long-term price stability.",
        "Such risks, however, should be limited by several attributes of the Thai labor market: (1) high labor market flexibility given supply of foreign workers and labor mobility across different sectors, (2) low bargaining power of Thai workers compared with other countries, (3) a low share of labor costs, at 15 percent of the total production costs for an average business, limiting the scope for labor cost passthrough, and (4) a relatively small share of wage earners – 45 percent of the total labor force, compared with impact of a minimum wage increase on aggregate demand and risks of a wage-price spiral appeared limited relative to other countries.",
        "The Committee nonetheless agreed to closely monitor the impact of the new government policies and assess their inflation implications, including through wages, firms’ price setting behavior, and the public medium-term inflation expectations.",

        "- In the Committee’s view, the real policy interest rate that prevails in the long run once the economy returns to its potential should at least be in the positive territory.",
        "Such a neutral real interest rate would appropriately balance savings and investment, thereby sustaining economic activity at its full potential without inducing inflationary pressures.",
        "Sufficiently high real interest rate would also help guard against search-for-yield behavior and excessive financial risk-taking, thus fostering long-term financial stability.",

        "At the same time, the lower-than-expected third-quarter GDP outturns continued to show a recovery of economic activity, notably in private consumption of services, despite merchandise exports having been muted.",
        "The broad trajectory of the recovery was consistent with a broad range of other indicators.",
        "These included steadily improving labor markets, with the unemployment rate having declined from its high of 2.20 percent during the pandemic to the level below 1 percent in the third quarter this year, as well as a recovery in consumer confidence to a two-year high in the same period.",
        "- The Committee recognized greater challenges in reading macroeconomic pulses from GDP releases, due to a greater divergence between expenditure-side and production-side activities.",
        "The resulting changes in stock and statistical discrepancy have grown as a consequence, pointing to potential structural changes such as the emergence of new types of services and the increasing role of online consumption.",
        "Measuring these economic activities may be particularly challenging.",
        "The Committee would prioritize engaging with relevant authorities to address these challenges as well as consulting a wide array of economic indicators to form a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the economic outlook.",
        "- To better communicate the economic outlook, the Committee agreed to publish projections including as well as excluding the impact of the government’s digital wallet scheme.",
        "This facilitated a comparison with forecasts of most other agencies which did not incorporate the effects of said scheme.",
        "Significant uncertainties remained regarding the scheme’s assessed impact, with many factors subject to further clarity.",
        "- The Committee discussed the downside risks stemming from structural impediments hindering Thailand’s potential, which would have to be addressed by supply-side policies to lay a foundation for strong and sustainable growth.",
        "Although the economy has continued to recover in the wake of the reopening, the speed of recovery has been held back by multiple structural headwinds such as (1) shifting global manufacturing supply chains, including China’s greater reliance on domestic production capacities, limiting Thailand’s gains from the global demand recovery, (2) technological progress that could alter the supply chains and negatively affect Thailand’s competitiveness, and (3) the relatively slow adjustments of domestic labor force amid rapid global shifts.",
        "These structural changes could hinder Thailand’s competitiveness and weigh on potential growth of the manufacturing sector, a key growth engine.",
        "The Committee saw urgency in providing a lift to the economy’s long-term potential growth, for example via infrastructure investment, labor upskilling programs, and policies to promote business adaptation to rapidly changing global trends.",
        "- The Committee assessed financial conditions to be moderately tighter in line with previous policy normalization, and overall have not hindered the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "Slowing business loan growth in the third quarter was partially due to increased repayments of loans incurred during the pandemic which saw a strong credit expansion, coupled with the phasing out of financial relief measures.",
        "New credit flows continued normally, while the overall business credit growth has recently started to stabilize in line with economic activities.",
        "The Committee would monitor the fund-raising ability of businesses given the still incomplete passthrough of the policy interest rate to lending rates, for example due to repricing of fixed-rate contracts.",
        "Additionally, certain corporate bonds particularly in the higher-risk segments could face challenges in rolling over their debts.",
        "Overall funding conditions in the bond markets remained normal, however.",
        "- The Committee deemed the current policy interest rate to be appropriate for supporting long-term sustainable growth.",
        "Nonetheless, the macroeconomic outlook remained highly uncertain, with both upside and downside risks: (1) the pace and continuity of global economic recovery; (2) the impact from the Middle East conflicts; (3) the severity of El Niño; and (4) the impact from government’s measures such as the digital wallet scheme and living-cost subsidies.",
        "Consequently, the Committee recognized the need to preserve policy space as an insurance against uncertain outlook.",
        "The current policy rate would also help guard against the buildup of financial imbalances that otherwise could arise under a low-for-long interest rate environment, including an excessive borrowing and search-for-yield behavior, which could exacerbate macro-financial vulnerability down the road.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy looking ahead, the Committee would take into account growth and inflation outlook as well as associated risks.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.",
        "One Committee member was unable to attend the meeting.",
        "In the Committee’s judgment, the economy overall continued to recover.",
        "Growth was expected to be more balanced in 2024 and 2025.",
        "At the same time, structural impediments could limit the positive effects of global recovery on Thai exports.",
        "Inflation was projected to stay within the target range, although upside risks lingered.",
        "Overall financial conditions tightened somewhat but in general do not hinder the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The overall financial system remained resilient.",
        "Nevertheless, there was a need to continue monitoring credit quality for some SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery.",
        "The Committee supported the targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups.",
        "Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth, and preserve financial stability.",
        "In view of these objectives, the Committee expected the Thai economy to gradually recover toward its potential, and inflation to be within the target range.",
        "The current policy interest rate is appropriate for supporting long-term sustainable growth.",
        "The Committee would take into account growth and inflation outlook as well as associated risks in deliberating monetary",
        "Trading partner economies continued to track the recovery path.",
        "The US economic outlook continued to improve from the services sector and strengthening employment as well as private consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, the Chinese economy softened more than expected in the second quarter, pointing to more sluggish recoveries in other Asian economies than previously anticipated, especially as Chinese manufacturing inventories remained high.",
        "Asian exports should nonetheless rebound in the fourth quarter this year, lifted by an expected global electronic cycle recovery.",
        "Sentiments in the global financial markets were buoyed by slowing global inflation following lower energy prices and better US economic outlook.",
        "Investors expected the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of monetary policy tightening, leading to increased risky asset prices and capital flows into some regional countries.",
        "Domestic financial conditions became less accommodative but remained supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The private sector continued to raise funds through the credit markets despite increased financing costs consistent with the policy rate.",
        "In the second quarter of 2023, total corporate funding grew loans contracted 1.1%.",
        "The contraction of business loans partly reflected a normalization of lending activity after an uninterrupted credit expansion throughout the COVID-19 crisis aided by extraordinary financial measures.",
        "The baht fluctuated against the US dollar, initially depreciating due to weak Chinese economic outturns before appreciating in line with regional currencies amid expectations of slower tightening in US monetary policy.",
        "Major risks looking ahead included the US monetary policy stance, Chinese economic momentum, and domestic political uncertainties.",
        "The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption, while softening merchandise exports were expected to improve.",
        "Several factors would lend support to the recovery: (1) the tourism sector should continue to benefit from a growing foreign tourist number, in line with the previous projections of 29 and 35.5 million for 2023 and 2024, respectively.",
        "The fewer-than-expected tourists from China to date have been offset by arrivals from other jurisdictions.",
        "(2) private consumption should continue to be robust, driven primarily by spending of medium- and high-income consumers.",
        "Improving employment and labor income, notably in the services and self-employed sectors, should continue to lend support, as in the second quarter of 2023 when real non-farm labor income expanded 2.4% over the previous quarter.",
        "Merchandise exports were projected to contract slightly this year, weighed by subdued Chinese demand, global electronic cycle, and a severe El Niño episode.",
        "However, merchandise exports should gradually pick up in the second half of this year, including those of air conditioners to the US and Europe given hotter climate, agro-manufacturing products to ASEAN, and electronics due to rising global demand for automotive semiconductors from ASEAN.",
        "Public consumption and investment were projected to decline from the previous year because of the delayed budgeting process but should rebound in 2024.",
        "Looking forward, risks to growth outlook include potential delays in exports due to slower global economic recovery, domestic political uncertainties, and a more severe El Niño episode.",
        "Headline inflation declined but should revert and stabilize within the target range.",
        "The recent fall in inflation could be attributed to a high base last year, cost-of-living subsidies, and lower energy prices, including electricity charges in line with natural gas prices and domestic retail oil prices.",
        "But as the influence of these temporary factors dissipate in the second half of upward pressure on raw food prices – the expected Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for the fourth quarter of 2023 was revised up from 1.1 to 1.9, indicating a more severe El Niño episode stabilize at a higher level than in the past.",
        "Falling food-in-core as well as services excluding housing rent inflation, together with lower cost pass-through by businesses, explained recent moderation in core inflation.",
        "At the same time, underlying inflation indicators continued to hover above historical averages, while persistently high global food prices shaped the prospects for Thai food inflation.",
        "Upside risks to inflation remained from higher food costs amid a more severe El Niño episode, which could accelerate cost pass-through in the context of sustained economic expansion.",
        "- The Committee deemed the economic and inflation outlook to be broadly similar to the previous assessment.",
        "Recent moderation in growth and inflation were expected to be short-lived.",
        "The outlook for growth was one of a sustained economic recovery, with downside risks from uncertain global demand and domestic political situation.",
        "Headline inflation slowed in near term from energy prices, cost-of-living subsidies, and high base last year.",
        "Inflation should, however, rebound in the second half of this year with upside risks from higher food prices amid a more severe El Niño episode.",
        "- The Committee saw substantial uncertainties surrounding the outlook, particularly pertaining to global economic recovery, domestic political developments, and severity of El Niño episode.",
        "Uncertain demand particularly from China would directly weigh on Thailand and the region given the tight trade linkages – China and ASEAN accounted for almost 40 percent of Thai goods exports.",
        "Domestic political developments could generate different shocks.",
        "On the one hand, a delayed formation of government could affect sentiments, with repercussion for private consumption and investment as well as tourism.",
        "On the other hand, the new government could introduce public spending and policies that expose growth and inflation to upside risks.",
        "For inflation, a particularly severe El Niño episode could drive up raw food prices including the costs of livestock feed.",
        "In the context of higher input costs and continuing economic expansion, a resurgence of cost passthrough by businesses remained a possibility.",
        "- The Committee assessed financial conditions to be less accommodative but still supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The Committee remained concerned over the financial positions of vulnerable households and businesses, and supported holistic and sustainable debt resolution.",
        "This would include further debt restructuring, as well as responsible lending measures to address persistent debt problems.",
        "Targeted measures such as these would likely be more effective and create less side effects than using the policy interest rate, a blunt instrument with much stronger and far-reaching effects on the macroeconomy.",
        "- The Committee agreed that monetary policy should give due consideration to macro- financial stability in the longer term.",
        "A low-for-long interest rate could contribute to a build-up of financial fragilities, for example in the form of elevated household debt and more widespread search-for-yield behavior leading to underpricing of risks in borrowing and investment activities.",
        "Over time, these developments would leave the business and financial sectors more fragile and vulnerable to shocks, hindering sustainable growth.",
        "Monetary policy should thus give due weight to longer-term macro-financial stability and guard against the build-up of financial imbalances by internalizing the undesirable side effects of a low-for-long interest rate environment.",
        "- The Committee expressed concerns over structural problems hampering potential growth of the economy.",
        "The Thai labor income share trended downward from 60 percent to 50 percent during the last 20 years, with the majority of employment being in lowerproductivity agricultural and services sectors.",
        "Declining labor income share could weaken private consumption and potential growth, with monetary policy implications.",
        "Addressing these structural problems would require supply-side policies to enhance labor productivity. '",
        "• In the Committee’s view, a higher policy rate would help preserve the policy space in light of highly uncertain outlook.",
        "A higher interest rate would add buffer to monetary policy and the financial system, enhancing the capability to respond to negative shocks.",
        "This buffer has been limited in the recent history, due to succession of adverse shocks depleting the available policy space.",
        "The present context of sustained economic expansion should provide an opportunity for building up policy space in readiness for uncertainties looking forward.",
        "- The Committee noted that the current policy rate was approaching the level consistent with longer-term macro-financial stability.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy to continue expanding toward its potential level.",
        "Headline inflation should stabilize within the target range, but upside risks remained.",
        "Monetary policy should keep inflation sustainably within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability.",
        "- In deliberating further policy rate increases, the Committee would evaluate the stance of monetary policy in relation to economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account associated risk assessments and uncertainties.",
        "It would be important to look through transient forces contaminating incoming data and focus on the medium-term economic outlook (outlook rather than recent data dependent).",
        "In doing so, monetary policy would be playing its appropriate stabilizing role, and not unduly adding or amplifying shocks to the economy.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from The Committee judges the economy to expand toward the potential level driven mainly by tourism and private consumption, while merchandise exports contracted in the short term, but should pick up looking ahead as the global economic activity gathers momentum.",
        "Inflation declined, but core inflation should stabilize at a higher level than in the past.",
        "Upside inflationary risks stem from uncertainty in forthcoming government economic policy and more-severe-than-expected El Niño episode.",
        "Overall financial conditions became less accommodative but remain supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The overall financial system remains resilient.",
        "Credit quality might deteriorate for some fragile SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability.",
        "The Committee supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending measures.",
        "Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability.",
        "In the context of continuing economic expansion and narrowing slack, monetary policy should keep inflation sustainably within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability by preempting the build-up of financial imbalances that could arise in a low-for-long interest rate environment.",
        "A higher policy rate would also help preserve the policy space in light of the highly uncertain outlook.",
        "The Committee therefore voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.",
        "In deliberating further policy rate increases looking ahead, the Committee will take into account economic and inflation outlook as well",
        "Trading partner economies were projected to expand by 2.7 and 2.5 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",
        "The services sector should continue to be the main growth driver for the rest of 2023, limiting the benefits for Asian merchandise exports.",
        "Global growth was expected to moderate somewhat in 2024, in part due to the impact from tighter monetary policy, as well as the softening Chinese economy amid lingering problems in the property sector.",
        "However, Asian merchandise exports should improve in line with an expected rebound in the global manufacturing activity and electronic cycle next year.",
        "Financial market volatilities increased.",
        "Risk appetite in the global financial markets worsened as the US dollar soared and the capital flows into regional economies slowed.",
        "The risk-off sentiments stemmed in part from growth concerns in China and the prospect of a tighter-forlonger US monetary policy stance.",
        "Domestic financial conditions tightened somewhat as private sector funding costs increased consistent with the policy rate.",
        "Slowing private credit growth partly reflected a normalization of lending activity after an extraordinary expansion due to the pandemic policy response, and looking ahead should improve in tandem with the economic recovery.",
        "Bond yields rose while the baht depreciated against the US dollar, driven by the US monetary policy outlook, and as market participants awaited clarity on the details and the funding sources for government policies.",
        "The Thai economy overall continued to recover with growth projected to be 2.8 and 4.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",
        "Growth in 2023 softened somewhat from a slower- than-expected recovery in merchandise exports and tourism, weighed by subdued growth in China and the global electronic cycle.",
        "Growth should however pick up in 2024, supported by several factors.",
        "First, private consumption should continue to expand on the back of the services sector, underpinned by a steady labor market recovery notably for tourism-related employment and with additional impetus from government economic policies.",
        "Second, tourism should continue to recover as reflected in the growing number of foreign tourists and sustained improvement in tourism demand indicators for Thailand.",
        "As a result, foreign tourist arrivals were expected to reach 28.5 million for 2023 and 35 million for 2024.",
        "Third, merchandise exports were projected to improve in line with the recovering global manufacturing activity and an upturn in the global electronic cycle, supported by a continued increase in the demand for automobiles and electrical appliances from key trading partners.",
        "The overall economic outlook remained uncertain, with upside risks from greater-thanexpected stimulus from government policies and downside risks from weaker-than-expected recovery in the global economy, especially China.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to remain within the target range, at 1.6 and 2.6 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",
        "Core inflation was expected to be 1.4 percent in 2023 and 2.0 percent in 2024.",
        "Inflation would remain low for the rest of 2023 due to government livingcost subsidies, subdued raw food inflation, and a high base last year.",
        "Inflation should pick up next year in line with stronger domestic demand, additional impetus from government economic policies and higher minimum wages, as well as higher food prices due to El Niño.",
        "Upside risks to inflation were (1) greater demand-side pressures related to government economic policies and (2) a resurgence of cost passthrough by businesses from higher food prices should the El Niño phenomenon intensify.",
        "- The Committee deemed the overall economic recovery trajectory to be intact.",
        "Despite slower growth this year due to worse-than-expected merchandise exports and tourism, growth in 2024 would be propelled by all key growth engines operating in fuller capacity.",
        "Domestic demand would be supported by higher labor income, underpinned by a steady tourism recovery and a turnaround in merchandise exports.",
        "The lower-than-expected outturns of second-quarter GDP were a key factor for the downward growth revision for outlook since domestic demand continued to expand robustly.",
        "While external demand had recovered more slowly than expected, a steady improvement was anticipated looking ahead.",
        "The Committee recognized greater challenges in interpreting and drawing implications from GDP releases, due to a post-COVID divergence between expenditureside and production-side GDP readings, notably in the growth-driving tourism-related services.",
        "A consequence has been the growing influence of the change in stock and statistical discrepancy on the recent expenditure-side GDP prints.",
        "The Committee would place emphasis on consulting a wide array of economic indicators to form a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the economic outlook.",
        "- The Committee agreed on the need to monitor the impact of government policies on economic growth and inflation.",
        "Particularly in the context of the economy approaching its potential, such policies could add meaningful inflationary pressures.",
        "The Committee discussed reasonable fiscal multiplier estimates associated with cash transfers, agreeing that they would likely be lower than those for government spending and investment.",
        "The exact magnitude of the fiscal multiplier however remained uncertain, depending on factors such as policy design, program size, funding source, duration, and behavioral response of the private sector.",
        "In view of these uncertainties, the Committee would continue to monitor demand pressures on inflation, along with any shifts in the pricesetting behavior or inflation dynamics, which could have implications for the mediumterm inflation expectations.",
        "In the Committee’s view, fiscal spending geared toward enhancing long-term growth potential, such as infrastructure investment and labor upskilling, could help promote both higher growth and long-term sustainability of public debt.",
        "- The Committee acknowledged greater financial market volatilities, which owed partly to domestic factors.",
        "There were outflows from both the bond and equity markets, with rising bond yields and baht depreciation against the US dollar.",
        "The global factors were in part responsible, particularly the market expectation of a tighter monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve for a more extended period.",
        "However, domestic factors were also at work, with market participants awaiting further details on government policies and assessing possible implications for macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.",
        "Although the impact of financial market volatilities on the Thai economy has been contained to date, the Committee agreed to closely monitor the unfolding developments and their potential macroeconomic effects.",
        "- The Committee assessed financial conditions to be somewhat tighter but still supportive of private sector funding and the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The deceleration in private credit growth partially reflected a normalization of lending activity, following the strong expansion thanks to financial sector policy responses during the recent pandemic period.",
        "Credit growth should pick up once economic activity gathers momentum, in the past typically after two to three quarters following economic recovery.",
        "So far, there were no indications that the recent decline in private credit was primarily a consequence of stricter credit standards – for instance, credit utilization rate remained lower than its historical average.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee remained concerned over financial positions of vulnerable households and businesses, and supported holistic and sustainable debt resolution.",
        "Such targeted measures were expected to be more effective with fewer unintended consequences than resorting to blanket non-discriminative policies.",
        "- The Committee agreed to lift the policy interest rate at this meeting, to a level consistent with supporting long-term sustainable growth.",
        "This policy stance would help keep inflation within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability by preventing the buildup of risks that could otherwise emerge in a low-for-long interest rate environment.",
        "The policy action would also rebuild policy space, a valuable insurance in the face of an uncertain outlook.",
        "- In deliberating monetary policy looking ahead, the Committee would carefully assess the evolving macroeconomic outlook as well as associated uncertainties.",
        "At the current juncture, the Committee was attentive to the upside risks to growth and inflation, in particular as stemming from government economic policies.",
        "Supply-side shocks related to the El Niño phenomenon could also put upward pressures on food prices and inflation more than expected.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor these developments and deliberate monetary policy based on the assessment of the growth and inflation outlook.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from In the Committee’s judgment, the economy overall continued to recover.",
        "Growth slowed somewhat in 2023, but should pick up in 2024.",

        "The Chinese economy continued to decelerate on the back of softened manufacturing production and private investment.",
        "Nevertheless, the slowdown was expected to be gradual, as the economy continued to receive support from the service sector and the ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus measures.",
        "However, weakening private investment led to a large decline in Chinese imports of goods, thereby adding downward pressure on global commodity prices.",
        "This had repercussions on other Asian economies, particularly those with strong trade linkage with China, heavy reliance on income from commodity exports, and a rapid build-up of corporate debt under the low global interest rate environment.",
        "Going forward, such factors are likely to weigh on the recovery of these economies.",
        "However, the overall financial stability of most Asian economies, including Thailand, remained sound.",
        "Meanwhile, the Japanese and the euro-area economies were further affected by the slowdown in China and emerging market economies.",
        "Coupled with lingering concerns over subdued inflation, the impacts might prompt additional monetary easing by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan in order to buttress the recovery of their respective economies.",
        "The US economy continued to expand with ongoing improvement in its economic fundamentals, adding to market expectations that the FOMC would raise the policy rate by the end of this year.",
        "Over the intermeeting period, financial market conditions were largely influenced by shifting market expectations about the timing of the FOMC’s rate hike.",
        "As it became apparent that the rate lift-off would not occur in the October meeting, volatility in the global financial markets subsided.",
        "As a result, there were signs of capital flows returning to Asian emerging economies, especially to the bond markets, causing a decline in Thai government bond yields from the last meeting, particularly in the maturities of 10-15 years.",
        "The baht also strengthened rapidly against the US dollar during the first half of October.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate baht’s movement was in line with the regional currencies.",
        "Meanwhile, the government’s announcement of additional stimulus measures helped shore up sentiment in domestic financial markets, prompting an increase in domestic stock prices.",
        "The Committee were of the view that the global financial markets remained subject to risks from China’s slowdown and the uncertain timing of the Fed’s policy normalization.",
        "Looking forward, volatility might increase; therefore, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial markets as well as the associated risks to financial stability.",
        "The Thai economy in the third quarter of 2015 gradually recovered at a pace close to the assessment at the previous meeting.",
        "The momentum of the tourism sector, as well as tourism- related service sector, softened due to a temporary fall in the number of tourists.",
        "Concurrently, exports continued to contract due to cyclical slowdown in Thailand’s major trading partners, coupled with structural limitations which weighed on the country’s competitiveness.",
        "Nevertheless, domestic demand slightly improved on the back of increased consumer spending on non-durable goods and business investment in certain sectors, especially telecommunications, alternative energy, and construction, which were supported by government policies.",
        "However, other sectors which rely on consumer loans, such as real estate and automotive, remained weighed down by high household debt and subdued consumer confidence.",
        "Nonetheless, it was expected that the fiscal stimulus measures, particularly through credit and tax measures for SMEs and real estate sector, and the acceleration of government spending in the fourth quarter will help support the economy, and partially compensate for the slowdown of external demand.",

        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent per annum as all members agreed that the overall monetary conditions remained accommodative, while the exchange rate movements stayed conducive to the economic recovery, despite prevailing downside risks from global economic uncertainty, structural limitations, and volatility in the global financial markets.",
        "Most members were of the view that further reduction in the policy rate during this period was likely to have a limited impact on the economic recovery, while potentially contributing to risks to financial stability.",
        "Meanwhile, fiscal stimulus measures should help support the economic recovery to a certain extent.",
        "Most members were also in agreement that the policy rate should be kept on hold to preserve the policy space for future use, while some members continued to see the need to monitor risks to economic and financial stability, which might arise from search for yield behavior under the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "Nonetheless, some members were concerned that exchange rate movements were, at times, volatile or became unconducive to the economic recovery.",
        "This issue warranted close monitoring going forward.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee were in agreement that monetary policy stance should continue to be sufficiently and continually accommodative.",
        "The Committee will closely monitor the issue of China’s economic slowdown, global financial markets, and the impact of fiscal stimulus measures on the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability.",
        "The global economy gradually recovered at a pace close to the assessment at the previous meeting, while the divergence in economic growth prospects of advanced and emerging market economies became more apparent.",
        "The advanced economies showed more signs of recovery, especially the US economy which continued to be supported by improvements in the labor market and domestic consumption, adding to market expectations that the FOMC would raise the policy rate at its December meeting.",
        "However, the Committee viewed that the FOMC’s rate hike should be gradual in nature so as to support economic recovery amid subdued inflation.",
        "The euro-area economy improved mainly on the back of private consumption.",
        "Nevertheless, muted investment and close-to-zero inflation prompted additional monetary easing by the European Central Bank.",
        "The Japanese economy rebounded in the third quarter as private consumption and investment picked up.",
        "Meanwhile, the Chinese economy continued to decelerate, putting downward pressure on global commodity prices.",
        "The slowdown also had repercussions on other Asian economies Looking ahead, the Committee viewed that Asian economies, including Thailand, would continue to face risks stemming from China’s economic restructuring which led to a decline in Chinese imports of goods.",
        "Meanwhile, the negative impact from China could not be fully offset by the benefits from a recovery in the advanced economies as they also relied less on imports.",
        "In addition, geopolitical risks might escalate following the Paris terrorist attacks, adding to uncertainty over the euro area’s economic recovery and possibly dampening global tourism, at least temporarily.",
        "Over the intermeeting period, financial market developments remained centered around the market expectation over the timing of the FOMC’s rate hike.",
        "As it became apparent that the FOMC would raise the policy rate in December, following better-than-expected economic data and constant communication by the FOMC members regarding the monetary policy stance, foreign investors cut back on their holdings of emerging market assets, including those of Thailand’s.",
        "Volatility in the financial markets consequently picked up and the baht weakened against the US dollar.",
        "However, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) remained relatively stable as the baht’s movements were largely in line with those of regional currencies.",
        "In the Committee’s assessment, volatility in the financial markets could potentially rise as a result of monetary policy divergence among advanced economies.",
        "Nevertheless, the Fed funds rate lift-off was likely to have limited impact on domestic financial markets under a gradual normalization path.",
        "Although capital outflows could depress domestic stock prices somewhat and put upward pressure on domestic bond yields, resulting in higher financing costs, the Committee judged that such development would not significantly weigh on the currently accommodative monetary conditions since Thailand’s external stability remained sound, as reflected by the country’s persistent current account surplus, low external debt to GDP ratio, and ample international reserves.",
        "From the third quarter to October 2015, the Thai economy recovered gradually, yet unevenly across sectors, at a pace close to the assessment at the previous meeting as it continued to receive support from high disbursement of public expenditure, an expansion in private consumption of necessity goods and services, and an improving number of tourist arrivals, especially from China.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports continued to contract because of a cyclical slowdown in Thailand’s major trading partners, shifting global trade structure, and structural limitations which weighed on the country’s competitiveness.",
        "Consumer spending on durable goods remained low, and commercial banks’ credits to business and household decelerated, due partly to prudent lending standard as credit risk increased.",
        "On the whole, growth projection for 2015 was revised to 2.8 percent, a slightly higher rate than the September assessment at 2.7 percent.",
        "Growth projection for 2016 was lowered slightly to 3.5 percent from the September assessment at 3.7 percent as a projected increase in private consumption and public expenditure could not compensate for a downward revision of export growth due to a slower-than-expected economic recovery of Thailand’s major trading partners.",
        "In addition, both the upside and downside risks around the baseline projection increased.",
        "The key downside risk was an even slower recovery of Thailand’s major trading partners, especially China and Asian countries.",
        "The key upside risk was the faster-than-expected expansion in public investment, which might additionally crowd in more private investment than currently assessed.",
        "Nonetheless, in the Committee’s assessment, overall risks to growth remained skewed to the downside.",
        "Inflationary pressure declined slightly from the previous meeting due mainly to a fall in global oil prices, causing headline inflation to stay in negative territory, probably into the first half of 2016.",
        "Headline inflation projection for 2016 was therefore revised down to 0.8 percent owing to lower cost pressure, while the projection for 2015 remained unchanged at -0.9 percent.",
        "The projections of core inflation for 2015 and 2016 were revised up slightly to 1.1 and 0.9 percent, respectively, as a continued expansion in household spending already allowed businesses to adjust prices of certain products and services upward, while there was also the impending increase in excise tax rate on vehicles next year.",
        "The Committee assessed that deflationary risks remained contained as demand continued to expand and core inflation was still positive, with the prices of most non-energy items stable or trending upwards.",
        "In addition, the public’s medium-term inflation expectations stayed close to the inflation target.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent per annum at this meeting.",
        "In their deliberation, members judged that monetary policy remained accommodative, as monetary conditions and the exchange rate were still conducive to the economic recovery.",
        "Meanwhile, growth and inflation outlook did not change materially from the previous meeting.",
        "Moreover, the Committee were in agreement that monetary policy at this juncture should give due weight to maintaining financial market stability, as volatility in the financial markets could potentially rise due to monetary policy divergence among advanced economies.",
        "Some members were of the view that further reduction in the policy rate was likely to have a marginal effect on the economic recovery, while fiscal stimulus would lend more support in the periods ahead.",
        "Moreover, the policy rate should be kept on hold to preserve the policy space for future use, if needed, as uncertainties, especially around the global development, were expected to remain high.",
        "Going forward, the Committee judged that monetary policy should continue to be sufficiently accommodative in order to support the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The Committee will continue to closely monitor downside risks to growth, particularly those stemming from a slowing global economy and uncertainty in the global financial markets.",
        "Moreover, in a prolonged period of low interest rates, most members saw the need to monitor risks to economic and financial stability, which might arise from search for yield behavior.",
        "The Committee stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability.",
        "The Committee discussed and confirmed the suitability of setting the annual average of headline inflation at 2.5 ± 1.5 percent as the monetary policy target for 2016 and the medium-term target, as it was considered to be consistent with the country’s economic fundamentals and close to those of Thailand’s trading peers, thereby preserving price competitiveness of Thai merchandise exports.",
        "Moreover, this particular target had been effective in anchoring inflation expectations of the public.",
        "In designating it as the medium-term target, the Committee reflected upon the transmission time lag of monetary policy to the economy and inflation rate, with an aim to facilitate efficient planning of consumption and investment by businesses and households.",
        "The Committee would seek consultation on the target with the Minister of Finance before submitting it to the Cabinet for approval.",
        "The global economy recovered at a slower pace than previously assessed due mainly to slowdowns in China and Asia.",
        "China’s growth slowed as a result of decelerating private investment and ongoing economic reforms, which aimed at containing financial stability risks and lifting the country’s long-term growth potential.",
        "Consequently, China lowered its growth target for 2015.",
        "Growth in other Asian economies also weakened from lower commodity prices and subdued exports and private investment, in part as a result of the slowdown in China.",
        "Japan’s economy continued to grow slowly with a weak recovery in private sector demand.",
        "Meanwhile, the euro area economies improved slightly on the back of exports and private consumption, which benefited from falling oil prices.",
        "Nonetheless, uncertainty surrounding the ongoing negotiation over the bailout program for Greece warranted close monitoring.",
        "As for the US, growth was entrenched as reflected in the better-than-expected outturns of economic data, especially in the labour market, prompting market expectation that the Fed could raise the policy rate as early as June 2015.",
        "However, given low inflationary pressure thanks to subdued global oil and commodity prices, many central banks decided to reduce their policy rates on the back of disappointing economic growth figures, including the central banks of Australia, India, Indonesia, and China.",
        "The Thai baht slightly strengthened against the US dollar and other major trading partners’ currencies over the intermeeting period, leading to an appreciation of the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER).",
        "Despite higher short-term volatility of the Thai baht as a result of hefty capital inflows in some periods, for example in the form of foreign investment in an infrastructure fund, the MPC viewed the stronger baht in recent periods as largely attributable to fundamental flows, particularly the current account surpluses and foreign direct investment, while portfolio investment flows were quite balanced overall.",
        "Nonetheless, the committee saw the need to closely monitor movements of the Thai baht and its impact on the Thai economy going forward.",
        "Since the last meeting, Thai government bond yields rose and moved broadly in line with US Treasury yields.",
        "On the whole, bond yield volatility increased somewhat as investors were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding Greece’s bailout negotiation.",
        "Most market participants anticipated the MPC to hold the policy rate at this meeting.",
        "In line with the committee’s assessment at the last meeting, there were no significant capital inflows to Thailand as a result of the ECB’s latest asset purchase program.",
        "In the periods ahead, capital inflows to Asia were expected to be limited as European investors generally prefer to allocate funds to financial markets in advanced economies.",
        "However, developments in global financial markets, particularly the implementation of monetary policy in major economies and its potential impact on capital flows and exchange rate volatility, warranted close monitoring going forward.",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Thai economy continued to recover modestly, with the momentum of private consumption and investment being softer than expected due in part to weaker private sector confidence and less-than-expected public investment.",
        "Economic data in January 2015 were largely comparable to December 2014, indicating a slow economic recovery.",
        "In the periods ahead, the economy was projected to recover at a slower pace than formerly assessed mainly due to softer domestic demand.",
        "Households were expected to remain cautious on spending, partly because their confidence on future income prospects had weakened.",
        "At the same time, firms were likely to delay investment, awaiting signs of a more solid recovery in domestic and external demand as well as progress on public investment.",
        "Exports of goods looked to recover at a rate close to the previous projection, but with higher downside risks from a slowdown in trading partners’ economies, notably China.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism should improve steadily, partially offsetting the weaker domestic demand.",
        "Overall, growth projection for 2015 was revised downward from the previous meeting to 3.8 percent, while growth projection for 2016 was revised slightly upward to 3.9 percent.",
        "In the first two months of 2015, headline inflation declined and turned negative due to falling global oil prices.",
        "Nonetheless, the prices of most goods and services continued to rise, as reflected by positive core inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, inflationary pressure was forecasted to remain at a low level, close to the committee’s previous assessment, in tandem with low energy prices and slow economic recovery.",
        "In 2015, headline inflation and core inflation were projected to register at 0.2 and 1.2 percent, respectively, while the projections for 2016 were 2.2 and 1.2 percent, respectively.",
        "MPC members discussed the development of key factors affecting the economic recovery.",
        "Weaker consumer confidence with respect to income outlook might further delay the recovery in private consumption.",
        "Furthermore, private investment incentives remained muted, in part due to excess capacity in many industries and the fact that some businesses continued to wait for evident implementation of public investment.",
        "Despite the recent pickup, exports of goods might be somewhat affected by the baht’s appreciation against trading partners’ currencies.",
        "Against this backdrop, members deliberated on the trajectories of growth and inflation under different policy rate paths, taking into account the various channels of policy transmission to real activity.",
        "In addition, the committee expressed concerns over the potential negative impact arising from an extended period of slow economic recovery and weak private sector confidence.",
        "Notably, the country’s long-term competitiveness might deteriorate with delays in private investment to enhance productivity.",
        "The MPC judged that the outlook of the Thai economic recovery was weaker than previously assessed and fiscal stimulus would take time to materialize.",
        "Meanwhile, private sector confidence had deteriorated, and headline inflation was expected to remain low for a certain period of time.",
        "The committee discussed and considered the effectiveness and potential costs of further monetary policy easing to lend more support to the economy under a prolonged period of low domestic interest rate environment.",
        "Although overall financial stability remained sound, the potential risk build-up associated with search-for-yield behaviour warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Four members viewed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate, with the following rationale: the economic recovery, as well as to help shore up private sector confidence.",
        "A weaker-thanexpected recovery, with growth staying below potential for a sustained period of time, could further dent sentiments, with repercussion on economic momentum in the periods ahead.",
        "adversely affected by the economic slowdown.",
        "stocks and a recent stock market correction.",
        "In addition, the expansion of new household debt had already been tempered following more prudent behaviours of both borrowers and lenders.",
        "headline inflation was likely to breach the lower bound of the target band for some periods ahead.",
        "Three members voted to maintain the policy rate at 2.00 percent per annum, with the following rationale: economic recovery.",
        "Fiscal stimulus, especially the implementation of planned public investment, should be a key growth driver at this juncture.",
        "In addition, further monetary policy easing would likely have a limited impact on growth given that private consumption had been restrained by elevated household debt burden and businesses had postponed new investment due to long implementation lag of public investment and excess capacity in several industries.",
        "This, in turn, could affect financial stability and depress national savings level in the long run.",
        "space should be preserved as a shock absorber, to be used when more necessary and in time of more effective policy transmission.",
        "positive supply shocks associated with falling global oil prices.",
        "Moreover, the inflation figure was expected to return to the target band in the period ahead, and hence should not pose concerns on monetary policy credibility.",
        "The MPC thus voted 4 to 3 to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 2.00 to 1.75 percent per annum.",
        "The committee deemed policy coordination and concerted efforts from both public and private stakeholders necessary in supporting the economic recovery.",
        "Going forward, the MPC will closely monitor developments of the Thai economy and will pursue appropriate policy to sustain the ongoing economic recovery, as well as to maintain financial stability in the long term.",
        "The global economy recovered at a slower pace than previously assessed, due mainly to a slowdown in the Chinese and Asian economies, and was subject to higher risks stemming from heightened volatility in China’s financial markets and uncertainty regarding the timing of Fed’s rate hike.",
        "The Chinese economy was projected to expand more slowly, particularly in industrial production that was highly linked with global supply chain and international trade.",
        "Nevertheless, the slowdown was expected to be gradual, as the economy continued to receive support from the service sector, fiscal stimulus and currency depreciation.",
        "Exports of other Asian economies were expected to be affected by softening demand from China and the weaker Yuan, although the depreciation of Asian currencies should partially offset these impacts, including from competition in third markets.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand of Asian economies weakened in line with dampening consumer confidence.",
        "By contrast, G3 economies showed signs of continued expansion.",
        "Although China’s slowdown might delay the recovery, the effect was expected to be marginal, especially for the US economy which was supported by improvements in the labor market and consumer confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, subdued price outlook and increasingly volatile global financial markets reinforced market expectations that the Fed would not raise the policy rate in September.",
        "Volatility in the Thai financial markets heightened in line with the global movements.",
        "Foreign investors reduced their holdings of Asian stocks and bonds amid growing concerns over China’s slowdown.",
        "As a result, the baht weakened against the US dollar, which was generally in line with regional peers.",
        "The sell-off by foreign investors also contributed to a decline in domestic stock market indices and a rise in Thai government bond yields.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee were of the view that heightened volatility in the global financial markets was likely to have limited impact on the Thai economy, as external stability remained sound and there was sufficient cushion against increased volatility.",
        "Indicators of external resiliency include persistent current account surplus, low external debt to GDP ratio, and adequate international reserves.",
        "However, the Committee will continue to monitor developments in the financial markets which could adversely affect investor confidence and cross-border capital flows.",
        "From the second quarter to July 2015, the Thai economy gradually recovered, with softer- than-expected growth momentum as risks were skewed towards the downside.",
        "Growth projections for the year 2015 and 2016 were therefore revised down to 2.7 and 3.7 percent, respectively.",
        "Most members were concerned about the ongoing sluggish trend in the export of goods, which was further weighed down by Chinese and Asian economic slowdown.",
        "This not only affected export volumes, but also contributed to a decline in the prices of commodity and electronic products, of which China was the world’s major consumer.",
        "Moreover, the recovery of the export sector would continue to be impeded by a shift in the global trade structure and loss of competitiveness of some products, though the depreciation of the baht should partly help increase liquidity of businesses.",
        "In addition, farm income was likely to decline further, particularly as rubber prices kept pace with the lower-than-expected crude oil price.",
        "At the same time, sluggish household income prospect was likely to hamper consumer confidence and consumption, with further repercussions on private investment.",
        "Nonetheless, the economy should receive some support from continued improvement in tourism, accelerated disbursement of public investment expenditure, and recent fiscal stimulus measures.",
        "In the periods ahead, the Committee were of the view that the economy might be affected by the negative factors by more than what was reflected in the baseline projection.",
        "Exports, in particular, could be hit more severely by China’s slowdown, while private investment seemed to lack positive factors to drive its momentum going forward.",
        "These scenarios were incorporated into the downside risks to the projection.",
        "Inflationary pressure declined due mainly to lower-than-expected crude oil prices.",
        "Consequently, headline inflation was projected to stay in negative territory for the rest of 2015, before turning positive in the first quarter of 2016, later than previously assessed.",
        "Headline inflation projections for 2015 and 2016 were revised down to -0.9 and 1.2 percent, respectively.",
        "In the Committee’s assessment, however, deflationary risks remained contained as core inflation was still positive, with the prices of most non-energy items stable or trending upwards.",
        "In line with that, the projection of core inflation in 2015 remained close to the previous assessment at 1.0 percent while that of 2016 was slightly below the previous assessment at 0.8 percent.",
        "Furthermore, inflation expectations stayed close to the target, albeit with the short-term indicator declining slightly.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee saw the need to monitor the development of global crude oil prices, as they might decline further from current baseline assumption due to higher-than-expected excess supply.",
        "Risks to overall financial stability increased somewhat, as the slow economic recovery hampered wealth and debt-servicing ability of households and businesses, especially small businesses, although it was unlikely to have systemic implications.",
        "Risks in the real estate sector increased as excess supply rose while short-term speculative demand in the condominium market picked up slightly.",
        "Nevertheless, risks to financial stability remained contained as the majority of developers were large in size, with strong financial position and sound risk management practices.",
        "In addition, most buyers engaging in speculative activities did not rely on debt financing, but rather reallocated their savings to higher-yielding assets.",
        "However, the Committee deemed it necessary to continue monitoring the impacts of slow economic recovery on private sector’s debt-servicing ability and excess supply in the real estate sector, which could potentially contribute to financial system fragility in the period ahead.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee were of the view that the Thai economy remained subject to negative factors, particularly on the external front.",
        "The momentum of domestic recovery was therefore weakened, while risks remained skewed to the downside.",
        "Meanwhile, global financial markets became more volatile as a result of developments in China’s financial markets and uncertainty regarding the timing of Fed’s rate hike.",
        "In this light, the Committee placed emphasis on considering the different global financial market scenarios and possible consequences on domestic economy.",
        "The Committee agreed that monetary policy at this juncture should give due weight to maintaining financial stability, and therefore voted unanimously to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent per annum.",
        "Most members were of the view that overall monetary conditions, including the exchange rate, continued to remain conducive to the ongoing economic recovery and therefore supported the decision to keep rate on hold at this meeting.",
        "Moreover, further reduction in the policy rate during this period was likely to have a marginal impact on the economic recovery, while contributing to financial stability risks.",
        "Going forward, the Committee were in agreement that the Thai economy would continue to face downside risks and therefore warranted the need for adequate and ongoing support from monetary policy.",
        "In this regard, the Committee would closely monitor Thailand’s economic and financial developments and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while maintaining economic and financial stability.",
        "The global economy recovered at a pace close to the previous assessment, with the US economic recovery remaining intact despite being temporarily affected by the unusually cold weather.",
        "The euro area economies exhibited more visible signs of recovery, as private consumption and exports were fuelled by lower funding costs and the weaker euro as a result of the ECB’s Quantitative Easing (QE) measures.",
        "Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounding Greece’s bailout program remained a risk to the recovery in the euro area economies.",
        "The Japanese economy continued to recover slowly, but going forward should receive additional boost from private consumption which was expected to pick up after the annual wage negotiation.",
        "The Chinese economic growth continued to decelerate due to waning private investment, thereby prompting the authorities to implement additional expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in order to propel the economy toward the growth target of 7.0 percent in 2015.",
        "Other Asian economies also slowed down, as their exports continued to be weighed down by weak commodity prices and subdued demand in major trading partners’ economies, particularly China, a major importer of commodities.",
        "Overall monetary conditions had eased further following the policy rate reduction at the last meeting, as reflected by a corresponding fall in the money market rates and the weakening of the Thai baht against the US dollar.",
        "However, the Thai baht subsequently pared losses against the US dollar as the FOMC signaled a possibility that the timing of the federal funds rate increase could be postponed.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), nevertheless, stabilized after having appreciated in the previous period.",
        "Meanwhile, Thai government bond yields declined in line with the lower policy rate, along with soft domestic data releases, and a more dovish FOMC statement.",
        "Moreover, commercial banks also lowered their lending and deposit rates following the policy decision.",
        "Most banks reduced lending rates by smaller amount than the reduction in fixed-deposit rates, while rates on current and savings accounts, which constituted the majority of deposits, were mostly unchanged.",
        "In addition, the Committee agreed with plans to relax foreign exchange regulations under the Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan, which represented continuing efforts to achieve more balanced capital flows.",
        "The measures on capital flows relaxation, scheduled to be announced on 30 April 2015, were acknowledged by the Committee.",
        "The Thai economy is projected to recover at a slower pace than assessed in the previous meeting.",
        "The pickup in public investment and positive trend in tourism should help shore up the economy, but could not fully offset the weaker-than-expected exports of goods and private consumption in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "Exports of goods contracted mainly from quantity reduction while private consumption indicators continued to decline for two consecutive quarters as a result of declining farm incomes, weaker employment outlook, and continued erosion in consumer confidence.",
        "Looking ahead, exports of goods are subject to greater downside risks from (1) the slowdown in trading partners’ economies, especially China and ASEAN; (2) shifting global and regional trade structure as Thailand’s major trading partners rely less on imports, curtailing the benefit of their economic recovery on Thai export volume; and (3) pressure from recent Thai baht appreciation, especially on low value-added and highly price-competitive products.",
        "Furthermore, the contraction in exports could weigh down private investment and consumption.",
        "Although the acceleration in public investment and monetary policy easing should help support private investment, the impact was likely to be limited given the excess production capacity and subdued growth in domestic demand.",
        "Inflationary pressure continues to decline broadly in line with softening domestic demand, while costs of production, particularly oil price, remain low.",
        "Such development increased the risks of prolonged negative headline inflation.",
        "Though not considered to be a deflation at present, more broad-based deceleration of prices, together with a fall in inflation expectations amid weak demand, contributed to a slightly higher risk of deflation in the periods ahead than formerly assessed.",
        "With regards to financial stability, the overall situation did not change significantly from the previous assessment.",
        "The non-performing loan ratio increased somewhat, still at a level deemed manageable by commercial banks given their ongoing conservative provisioning.",
        "The Committee discussed the possibility of the economy regaining momentum in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Some members judged that economic growth was subject to significant downside risks, on the back of the following grounds: (1) the pickup in fiscal stimulus could be temporary, and the disbursement rate, while rising in the first quarter, remained lower than past averages; (2) the benefit of lower oil prices might not be sufficient to offset the impact of falling incomes, as manifested in the recent slowdown in manufacturing employment, and a drop in agricultural employment; and relationship between the global economy and the Thai exports, coupled with the strength of the Thai baht.",
        "In addition, the Committee further discussed the credit quality situation and its implications on the economy.",
        "The Committee were of the view that the somewhat lower credit quality caused commercial banks to be more cautious in extending credit to a certain group of borrowers.",
        "Committee members were in agreement that the Thai economic growth in 2015 was likely to be weaker than previously assessed, and hence warranting the need to employ available monetary policy tools in order to maintain continued accommodative monetary conditions.",
        "This should help shore up public confidence, and support economic recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "At the same time, the Committee also discussed the room to reduce the policy rate further (policy space), as going forward, there remained uncertainties in both the internal and external environment.",
        "Given the dilemma, the Committee extensively discussed the most effective utilization of the policy space.",
        "Following the deliberation, five members viewed a reduction of the policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent as appropriate, with the following rationale: order to preempt the expected economic slowdown.",
        "Delaying an additional policy rate reduction, on the other hand, could hamper economic recovery.",
        "businesses, and also contribute to exchange rate adjustments toward a level more conducive to economic recovery.",
        "This should thus help lift the private sector confidence.",
        "appropriate level, given that headline inflation is likely to remain below the lower bound of the target band for a longer period of time.",
        "Two members deemed maintaining the policy interest rate at 1.75 percent as appropriate, with the following rationale: Meanwhile, previous monetary policy actions have contributed to continuous easing of monetary conditions, while the recent pickup in fiscal stimulus should help shore up the economy to a certain degree.",

        "The Committee therefore voted 5 to 2 to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points from 1.75 to 1.50 percent.",
        "The Committee will continue to monitor Thailand’s economic and financial developments, and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are sufficiently accommodative for a continued recovery.",
        "The global economy recovered at a pace slower than previously assessed, with greater downside risks stemming from a more-than-expected slowdown in China despite additional expansionary monetary and fiscal measures from the Chinese authorities.",
        "The deceleration of growth in China weighed down economic expansion in other Asian economies (excluding Japan) as exports to China and intra-regional trade contracted, in line with softening domestic production.",
        "The US economy decelerated due to larger contraction in net exports and waning investment in the energy sector amid sluggish global oil prices.",
        "Nonetheless, sound economic fundamentals should continue to support the ongoing recovery in the periods ahead, prompting market expectation that the FOMC would begin to raise the policy rate this year.",
        "Meanwhile, the euro area’s economic recovery continued with more visible signs of an upturn in private consumption whereas the ECB’s Quantitative Easing (QE) measures helped support the economic recovery.",
        "However, the economies remain subject to the uncertainty surrounding Greece’s debt servicing ability.",
        "The Japanese economy recovered at a measured pace, and going forward should receive an additional boost from an improvement in private consumption, in part as consumers’ confidence was bolstered by results of the annual wage negotiation.",
        "Overall, the slower global economic recovery was viewed as one of the factors contributing to a more subdued recovery of Thai exports going forward.",
        "The policy rate reduction at the meeting on 29 April 2015 helped ease overall monetary conditions further, as reflected by a corresponding fall in money market rates and Thai government bond yields.",
        "Nevertheless, medium- to long-term yields moved up since the previous meeting due mainly to sell-offs in the region’s bond markets during the first half of May 2015.",
        "The Thai baht against the US dollar, and the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) persistently depreciated as market participants’ view on the baht turned bearish following the rate decision at the previous meeting, as well as the ensuing announcement of contributing factor to the weakening of the Thai baht was the sell-offs of emerging markets securities in May which generated net outflows from the Thai bond market.",
        "Moreover, volatilities in the bond and foreign exchange markets heightened as a result of concerns over the timing of the FOMC’s interest rate lift off, and the Greek debt servicing situation.",
        "Commercial banks’ deposit and lending rates were lowered following the policy rate reduction at the meeting on 29 April 2015, but the response in general tended to be slower and smaller than that following the 11 March 2015 meeting.",
        "The Thai economy recovered at a pace close to the previous meeting’s assessment.",
        "Economic momentum in the first four months of 2015 softened due to sluggish private consumption and continued contraction in exports, as a result of a slowdown in the Chinese and Asian economies and a shift in global trade structure.",
        "Nevertheless, an increased disbursement of public investment expenditure and a continued improvement in tourism helped shore up the economy.",
        "In addition, the consecutive policy rate reductions at the two previous meetings have helped, to some extent, increase liquidity and reduce financial costs of businesses.",
        "In the periods ahead, the economic outlook was projected to improve gradually as government spending, especially public investment expenditure, was expected to maintain its momentum while tourism activities should continue their positive trend.",
        "However, the economic recovery remains fragile.",
        "Households remain cautious in their spending, due mainly to sluggish income growth and continued strict credit standards.",
        "Moreover, exports are subject to downside risks from softer-than-assessed recovery of the global economy particularly the Chinese and Asian economies.",
        "Amid a fragile recovery in private consumption and a weak outlook of exports, private investment is potentially delayed further as a result.",
        "On balance, the projection of economic growth was adjusted downward to 3.0 percent in 2015, but revised up slightly to 4.1 percent in 2016.",
        "Headline inflation continued to stay in a negative territory due mainly to energy costs and raw food prices.",
        "However, it was anticipated to pick up in the second half of the year as the base effect of high oil prices should begin to wane, coupled with expected rises in oil and raw food prices as supply of global crude oil and excess supply of domestic agricultural products were expected to fall.",
        "Core inflation was still positive but declined somewhat owing to subdued demand-side pressure.",
        "On balance, the projections for the headline inflation and core inflation were slightly revised downward to -0.5 and 1.0 percent in 2015 and 1.6 and 1.0 in 2016, respectively.",
        "Nevertheless, in the Committee’s assessment, the risk of deflation remains low, as consumption continues to increase, while the prices of most goods and services still increases or stays unchanged, and inflation expectations are close to the inflation target.",
        "The Committee acknowledged the improvement on the compilation of the quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by National Economic and Social Development Broad (NESDB) and discussed its implication on monetary policy.",
        "The revisions included a change in compilation method of real GDP from the Fixed Weight Volume Measures with 1988 as a fixed base year to the Chain Volume Measures (CVM).",
        "In addition, economic activities included in the new data coverage were broadened and some were reclassified to enhance data comprehensiveness.",
        "Following the revisions, the Thai economy structure implied by the new series better reflected the current composition of the economy compared to that suggested by the original series.",
        "Nevertheless, the overall assessment of the potential economic growth, the output gap, and the business cycles under the revised data did not change significantly from the previous one.",
        "Overall, the Committee deemed the revisions of the GDP data as neutral to the conduct of monetary policy going forward.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee placed importance on the assessment of trade-offs between effectiveness of further policy rate reduction and a need to preserve the limited policy space for future use.",
        "In this light, the Committee judged that the conduct of monetary policy had thus far eased monetary conditions, while the direction of exchange rate movement had become more conducive to the economic recovery.",
        "Nevertheless, commercial banks’ responsiveness to an additional reduction in the policy rate was expected to be lesser and slower under the current context.",
        "At the same time, as there remain downside risks to growth from both external and domestic sources, the Committee considered the policy space that should be preserved to address those downside risks.",
        "Following the discussion, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent.",
        "Members were in agreement that, amid heightened downside risks to growth, the prevailing policy space should be preserved at this juncture, to be employed as warranted by situation and when further policy rate reduction would become more effective.",
        "In turn, the recent pickup in fiscal stimulus should help shore up the economy and thus allowed the Committee some time to assess the impact of previous policy actions on the real economy.",
        "Furthermore, some members were of the view that, under prolonged low interest rate environment, further policy accommodation could create more financial imbalances, by encouraging search-for-yield behavior while discouraging household saving in the long run.",
        "Going forward, the Committee assessed the outlook of Thai economic recovery to remain fragile, and thus saw a need to maintain continued and sufficiently accommodative monetary conditions by employing appropriate policy tools.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor Thailand’s economic and financial developments, and stand ready to utilize the available policy space appropriately in order to support the ongoing recovery and maintain long-term financial stability.",
        "The global economic recovery was projected to continue at a rate close to the last meeting’s assessment.",
        "Nevertheless, downside risks increased, particularly from a weak economic recovery in the euro area which could be further affected by domestic political uncertainties and intensifying international conflicts.",
        "Outlook for other major economies was broadly in line with the committee’s previous evaluation.",
        "The Japanese economy expanded at a low pace due to a gradual recovery in private consumption and investment.",
        "Economic activities in China continued to moderate due in part to economic reform policies to contain financial stability risks.",
        "Meanwhile, the US economic recovery strengthened thanks to improving economic fundamentals.",
        "Going forward, key factors influencing the global economic outlook included (1) movements in global oil and commodity prices which would affect individual economies differently; (2) development in geopolitical situations; and (3) the timing of the Federal Reserve’s policy rate normalization and global financial market volatilities that might follow.",
        "Inflation continued to decline and turned negative in some countries, particularly those highly connected to the euro area economies and were faced with higher deflation risks.",
        "This prompted certain central banks to ease monetary policy.",
        "However, most central banks in the region maintained the policy interest rates.",
        "Since the beginning of 2015, major currencies fluctuated amid heightened uncertainty in the global economic outlook due in part to more intense geopolitical conflicts and unexpected monetary policy actions by some major central banks.",
        "Important events included the European Central Bank (ECB)’s announcement of a larger-than-expected asset purchase program and the Swiss National Bank’s lifting of the exchange rate floor.",
        "Movements of regional currencies diverged, depending on the impact of oil prices on respective economies.",
        "The Thai baht slightly appreciated against the US dollar, consistent with other regional currencies whose economies benefited from falling oil prices.",
        "By contrast, the currencies of net oil-exporting countries in the region depreciated.",
        "The Thai government bond yields fell as there was higher demand from both foreign and domestic investors.",
        "The movement in yields was influenced, in part, by the development in the US Treasury market, as well as a lower-than-expected inflation outturn in December 2014.",
        "Regarding monetary policy outlook, most market participants expected the committee to maintain the policy interest rate at this meeting.",
        "Members actively discussed the prospects of capital flows to the regional and Thai financial markets following the ECB’s expanded asset purchase program and policy easing by some central banks.",
        "In the view of some members, Thai economic fundamentals, particularly a surplus in the current account from falling oil prices, might be a factor attracting capital inflows in the periods ahead.",
        "Nevertheless, the low level of Thai government bond yields might somewhat discourage the inflows.",
        "In addition, the magnitude of the overall impact would depend on the level of liquidity in the global financial markets as well as investors’ risk appetite.",
        "Up to the date of this meeting, the effect on the Thai financial markets was not evident, but the development, particularly in the exchange rate market, warranted close monitoring in the periods ahead.",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Thai economy recovered gradually at a pace close to the previous projection, with slower-than-expected expansion in domestic demand being offset by an improvement in the exports of goods and services.",
        "Public spending rose modestly from the previous period, though the magnitude of fiscal stimulus remained smaller than anticipated.",
        "Looking ahead, the economy would benefit from lower global oil prices via (1) improving trade balance, despite the fact that the prices of certain exports items might fall in line with global oil prices; (2) higher household purchasing power, as the costs of living eased, corresponding with a decline in headline inflation; and (3) reduced costs of production which, in turn, should be translated into higher corporate profits.",
        "This, however, might not lead to additional investment in the near term, as spare production capacity should remain in many industries.",
        "In 2015, nevertheless, private investment was expected to pick up from last year as firms which had already obtained investment incentives from the Board of Investment should gradually carry out their investment plans.",
        "Greater clarity of public investment projects was also expected to help drive the growth momentum of private investment in the periods ahead.",
        "Headline inflation declined in line with global oil prices, and was expected to slip into negative territory in the first half of 2015.",
        "This, however, was not considered deflation for the following reasons.",
        "in tandem with the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "(2) The decline in global oil prices was expected to be a temporary phenomenon and the trend should reverse in the second half of this year.",
        "(3) Inflation expectation remained close to the central target of headline inflation.",
        "The committee expressed concerns over downside risks to the recovery and followed up on the progress of public spending disbursement, particularly the investment expenditure which was critical in adding impetus to the recovery.",
        "Moreover, the committee discussed extensively the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy.",
        "On the one hand, some members took the view that the changing nature of the global supply chain had resulted in more intense price competition, as it gave the customers more bargaining power.",
        "On the other hand, other members argued that, in many industries, switching manufacturers within the supply chain could be complicated by the need to meet specific production standards and also deterred by the long-established trading partnership.",
        "Overall, members were in agreement that dynamic technological and productivity improvements would enable Thai exports to better respond to changing global demand, and therefore would truly reinforce the competitiveness of the exports sector in the long-run.",
        "In the committee’s assessment, the Thai economy should continue to recover in 2015 at a rate close to the previous projection.",
        "Although core inflation remained relatively close to the previous assessment, headline inflation declined more than previously assessed, due mainly to a more-than-expected drop in crude oil prices.",
        "In addition, risks of capital inflows heightened following the easing of monetary policy in several countries.",
        "Against this backdrop, the committee discussed: (1) The impact on the domestic economy and inflation of higher downside risks to the global economy, falling oil prices, easing monetary policy in several countries, capital flows and exchange rate movements; (2) The need for additional support from monetary policy given that monetary conditions had recently become less accommodative; and (3) The conduct of monetary policy in the environment where headline inflation was expected to breach the lower bound of the target band.",
        "Five members deemed maintaining the policy interest rate at 2.00 percent per annum as ongoing economic recovery, while public investment spending would be more effective in shoring up business confidence and thus ensuring a more steady recovery in the periods ahead.",
        "Moreover, an additional reduction in the policy rate was unlikely to provide a meaningful boost to the economic recovery at the current juncture.",
        "According to the business sentiment survey, most firms did not consider the interest rate level an impediment to their current business operations.",
        "decline in headline inflation was a result of positive supply shocks, which should help support the economic recovery.",
        "This should not raise concerns as in the case of deflation caused by aggregate demand contraction.",
        "In fact, there was no evidence suggesting that the public expected a sustained decline in the general price level, which could lead to delays in consumption and investment.",
        "Two members viewed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum as appropriate in lending more support to economic recovery in light of higher risks from global economy and financial markets and the long implementation lag of fiscal stimulus.",
        "Their rationales are as follows: effectively result in rising real interest rates.",
        "Monetary policy should thus ease further to help avert the tightening of the overall monetary conditions.",
        "and add pressure on the Thai Baht, affecting the still fragile economy recovery.",
        "headline inflation was likely to breach the lower bound of the target band.",
        "The committee thus voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy interest rate at 2.00 percent per annum.",
        "Going forward, members agreed that monetary policy should remain accommodative in order to ensure a steady recovery of the economy.",
        "The MPC would closely monitor economic and financial development, and stand ready to implement appropriate policy as warranted.",
        "Open letter explaining the movement of headline inflation in January 2015 below the lower bound Headline inflation had fallen steadily and was expected to become negative in January 2015.",
        "Although this would not officially breach the inflation target which was set in the form of average annual headline inflation, the MPC decided to communicate with the public by issuing an open letter to the Ministry of Finance in order to show commitment to the monetary policy framework and to help anchor public expectation of future inflation.",
        "The open letter would convey the committee’s view as follows: the decline in the price level was not broad-based, as reflected in stable and positive core inflation.",
        "In addition, medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the inflation target, suggesting that the public viewed the current negative inflation rate as a temporary phenomenon.",
        "and therefore should, in part, help lift headline inflation back within the target band by the end of",
        "The global economy recovered at a slower pace than previously assessed, mainly due to the slowdown in the Chinese and Asian economies.",
        "Going forward, higher downside risks to the global growth outlook might weigh down the Thai economy, especially the export sector.",
        "In particular, growth of the Chinese economy decelerated from the previous year, and could be adversely affected by the recent plunge in domestic stock prices.",
        "At the same time, excess housing supply could pose additional downside risks to growth, thereby warranting close monitoring.",
        "The slowdown in China, coupled with its ongoing structural shift resulting in lower reliance on imported goods, contributed to sluggish export performance of Asian (excluding Japanese) economies, aggravating the already-weak domestic demand.",
        "The advanced economies, nevertheless, continued to improve broadly as expected.",
        "The US economy showed signs of a more solid recovery, especially in the labor market.",
        "This could potentially prompt the FOMC to begin raising the federal funds rate by year-end.",
        "The euro-area economy recovered gradually, while near-term risks of Greece’s sovereign debt default subsided and posed no material impacts on the Thai economy thus far.",
        "The Committee would continue to monitor the progress of Greece’s economic and fiscal reforms – which might prove to be difficult against the backdrop of the country’s weak recovery – as well as its implications on the euro-area economy in the longer term.",
        "Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continued to recover, supported by the annual wage increases.",
        "During the inter-meeting period, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar as well as in nominal effective terms.",
        "The weakened baht was consistent with market expectation of the forthcoming Fed rate hike and investors’ perception of higher downside risks to the Thai economic outlook, leading to sell-offs in domestic bond and stock markets.",
        "Exchange rate volatility also heightened in light of more uncertainties in the global financial markets, owing to speculation over the timing of the FOMC’s rate increase and the risk of Greece’s sovereign debt default before the financial assistance plan was agreed upon, coupled with instances of rapid baht depreciation due to domestic factors.",
        "Nevertheless, overall volatility of the baht was relatively moderate when compared with regional currencies.",
        "Meanwhile, government bond yields declined across all maturities with movements of medium- to long-term yields being influenced mainly by the decrease in US government bond yields.",
        "In the second quarter of 2015, the Thai economy recovered at a pace close to the previous meeting’s assessment.",
        "Nevertheless, going forward, the economic outlook was subject to more negative factors, leading to a slight downward revision of the growth projection for 2015 from the previous meeting.",
        "The main drivers of growth would continue to come from investment spending.",
        "Nonetheless, they could not fully offset the weaker momentum of domestic demand and exports of goods amid two main factors restraining economic recovery: (1) the slowdown in the Chinese and other Asian economies which should subject exports of goods to further contraction, although the recent weakening of the baht might help buoy exports to some extent, and (2) domestic drought which could weigh down the already-weak recovery of private consumption through a decline in farm income and private confidence.",
        "Due to the fragile economic recovery, most firms tended to delay investment to expand production capacity.",
        "Headline inflation continued to stay in the negative territory due mainly to energy costs.",
        "However, it was likely to have bottomed out and was expected to gradually pick up in the second half of the year as the base effect of high oil prices should begin to wane.",
        "Nonetheless, the period at which headline inflation was expected to turn positive might be delayed as a result of more subdued demand-side pressure and slower-than-projected global oil price recovery.",
        "As the outlook of Thailand’s economic recovery was expected to remain subdued amid greater downside risks to growth, the Committee saw a need to closely monitor and assess economic conditions, particularly labor market conditions and household income in various sectors.",
        "Recent data pointed towards lower average working hours of non-farm workers, due possibly to (1) softening demand conditions, and (2) temporary migration of farm workers, who suffered from low agricultural prices and domestic drought, to non-farm sectors with less-than-average working hours.",
        "Overall, this might dent income, consumption, and confidence of households.",
        "The issue would thus be under close surveillance, together with signs of fragility of small- and medium-sized firms, which felt considerable negative impacts from the slow economic recovery, as reflected by their deteriorated loan qualities.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent per annum as all members agreed that the overall monetary conditions remained accommodative.",
        "This was reflected by the exchange rate movements that stayed conducive to the economic recovery and firms’ costs of funds in the money market that had declined following the previous policy rate reductions, despite potentially limited and inert commercial banks’ responsiveness to additional policy easing in the current situation.",
        "Furthermore, some members deemed further rate reduction could pose risks to financial market stability in the short term amid heightened global market volatility, while some members continued to see the need to monitor risks to economic and financial stability, which might arise from search for yield behavior and lower trend of household saving in the long term.",
        "Going forward, the Committee were of the view that monetary policy stance should continue to be adequately accommodative to support the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor Thailand’s economic and financial developments and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while maintaining long-term economic and financial stability."

        "The Thai money market was largely unaffected by the stress in global financial markets.",
        "Domestic liquidity, as well as those in the foreign exchange market, was sufficient and volatility in the swap market remained contained, albeit at slightly elevated levels.",

        "More volatility was seen for government bond yields in the medium and long-term maturities as investors grappled with heightened uncertainty in the global economy.",
        "Risks to the global economy increased relative to the previous meeting as doubts about the ability of Greece to remain in the eurozone grew and the Spanish economy became increasingly affected by the growing fragility of its banking system.",
        "As a result, the contraction in the eurozone economy was likely to be more protracted than previously anticipated, with greater potential repercussions on the global economy.",
        "The US economy, in particular, would be susceptible given its close link with the eurozone economy and the still fragile state of its recovery, as reflected in latest signs of weaknesses in the labor market.",
        "While strong domestic consumption and consumer confidence continued to form the foundation of the recovery, the potential drag to economic activity from the anticipated expiration of fiscal stimulus measures was a source for concern.",
        "Economic growth in Asia moderated and the rebound in exports was expected to soften in line with the slowdown in China and the global economy.",
        "On the positive side, robust domestic demand and remaining fiscal and monetary policy space would help to cushion the impact of weaker global economic growth on Asia to some extent.",
        "Global price pressure moderated as oil and commodity prices fell on the back of a weaker global economic outlook.",
        "Most central banks kept policy interest rates unchanged, opting to wait for greater clarity on the global economic outlook and preserving the room to act should the situation in the eurozone economy deteriorate markedly.",
        "The Thai economy recovered faster than expected in the first quarter.",
        "The recovery in the manufacturing sector was swift with production back almost to pre-flood levels, driven in part by the pressing need for inventory buildup.",
        "Restoration spending and capacity expansion fueled a robust pickup in private investment, while private consumption growth continued to be buoyed by a strong labor market, increased farm income and higher consumer confidence.",
        "Government spending also picked up following the implementation of the Budget Act.",
        "At the same time, monetary conditions remained accommodative, with credit continuing to expand rapidly.",
        "Although much of the supply constraints had been addressed, exports were weighed down by weakening external demand, particularly from Europe.",
        "The Thai economy continued to gain traction from the recovery in production and domestic demand.",
        "Despite the much stronger outturn in the first quarter, economic growth for 2012 was expected to remain at 6.0 percent.",
        "This reflected a weaker outlook for the remainder of the year as export growth was revised downwards in light of the worsening global economic outlook.",
        "Moreover, government spending was expected to be lower than previously projected.",
        "Risks to the outlook also increased from uncertainties surrounding the global economy.",
        "In particular, should the situation in the eurozone economy deteriorate markedly, Thai exports would be affected directly as well as indirectly through the contraction in exports of other countries, such as China, and the resulting drag on the economic recovery could be substantial.",
        "Inflationary pressure persisted, albeit at a more moderate level relative to the previous meeting as production costs eased.",
        "Oil and commodity prices fell against the backdrop of a softer global economic outlook.",
        "Nonetheless, robust domestic demand kept the degree of pass-through of costs to final goods prices elevated.",
        "Notably, the price of processed food, a staple item for Thai consumers, continued to rise, while inflation expectations remained elevated compared to historical levels partly due to the recent minimum wage hike and the anticipated energy price structure reform.",
        "The MPC assessed that the balance of risks for the Thai economy was skewed towards growth rather than inflation, primarily reflecting heightened global economic uncertainties.",
        "The most likely scenario involved a drawn out crisis in the eurozone economy given the weak state of public finances in several countries, fragilities in the banking system, and persistently high unemployment.",
        "Solving such deep-rooted problems would take time.",
        "Meanwhile, with confidence fragile and sentiment weak, a number of factors, especially on the political front, could trigger a rapid worsening of the situation.",
        "Given the shift in the balance of risks, the MPC considered whether there was a need for monetary policy to be eased further.",
        "Key issues raised in discussion were as follows.",
        "(1) Although risks to the global economy had heightened, its impact on the Thai economy had not changed materially, with domestic economic activity remaining strong and on course to return to potential by the end of this year.",
        "Some recent moderation in price pressure notwithstanding, the strength of the economic recovery continued to put pressure on inflation, which was projected to remain higher than the mid-point of the policy target.",
        "A few members noted that shortages of raw material and labor were constraining some sectors and, in the context of the elevated inflation expectations, would drive pass-through of costs to final goods and services prices in the period ahead.",
        "(2) Monetary conditions remained accommodative and commensurate with the needs of the economy.",
        "Private loan growth was robust and low long-term real interest rates were supportive of investment spending.",
        "Some members viewed that funding costs were not a key obstacle for businesses at this point, especially when compared to constraints from limited availability of labor and raw material.",
        "(3) Given the risk that the global economy may deteriorate substantially, it was important to preserve room for interest rate policy to act by waiting for greater clarity on continuing developments abroad.",

        "(2) The fragile recovery of the U.S. economy, as reflected by lower than expected employment and consumption figures, and uncertainty over whether or not key fiscal stimulus measures scheduled to expire at the end of this year would be extended.",
        "The slowing global economy weighed on Asian and Chinese exports, which were anticipated to be weaker than previously assessed.",
        "Some MPC members viewed the moderation in export growth as suggestive of Asia’s limited capacity to act as the main driving force for the global economy going forward.",
        "As global price pressure softened in line with weaker global demand, a few central banks, such as in South Korea, China, as well as the eurozone, eased policy with a view to containing downside risks to growth.",
        "The Thai economy continued to recover from the floods and the level of activity had returned to normal.",
        "Domestic demand was supported by accommodative financial conditions, strong private credit growth, good employment opportunities and government stimulus measures.",
        "These factors should continue to sustain private consumption and investment expenditures going forward.",
        "Nonetheless, a few MPC members viewed that constraints on the supply of key inputs, particularly shortages of labour in some industries, would limit growth of the country’s production capacity in the long run.",
        "While the MPC projected economic growth to be close to potential with continued expansion of domestic demand, the slowdown in the global economy would detract from Thai export growth to a greater extent than previously anticipated.",
        "Relative to the previous meeting, export growth for 2012 was revised downward from 8.3 percent to 7 percent, while projected GDP growth was lowered from 6.0 percent to 5.7 percent in 2012 and from 5.4 percent to 5.0 percent in 2013.",
        "Price pressure moderated in tandem with the softer economic outlook, and inflation was projected to return to the mid-point of the target sooner than previously assessed.",
        "The MPC deliberated on the recent rapid growth in private credit.",
        "While a major driving factor was attributed to credit extension by government specialised financial institutions, commercial bank loans had also expanded at a fairly high rate.",
        "This was viewed as reflective of the upcycle in private investment, as well as accommodative loan supply conditions.",
        "Although there were currently no clear signs of excessive credit growth, with the level of non-performing loans still at a low level, the committee would continue to closely monitor the expansion of loans by both commercial banks and specialised financial institutions.",
        "The MPC viewed that the outlook for global economic growth had weakened with heightened risks compared to the previous assessment, and anticipated that the impact on Asian and Thai economies would become more evident in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand expanded close to potential and inflationary pressure subsided.",
        "With the balance of risks skewed more towards growth rather than inflation, monetary policy could play a role in supporting economic activity if necessary.",
        "However, members differed somewhat in their assessment of the balance of risks.",
        "Two members viewed that a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum was warranted as the weakening global economy could act as a drag on the Thai economy through its larger than expected impact on the export sector.",
        "Moreover, there was the risk that the support from fiscal stimulus measures could be delayed and their impact more muted than currently assumed.",
        "Further easing of monetary policy at an early stage would thus help to shore up confidence and sustain private investment growth.",
        "Five members assessed that the current policy rate of 3.0 percent per annum was appropriate, viewing the prevailing macroeconomic policy mix as suitably supportive of domestic economic growth and already providing a degree of cushioning against global economic risks.",
        "This assessment was supported by an overall economic picture in which growth was close to potential, inflation projected to remain within target, and monetary conditions accommodative with low real interest rates and robust credit growth.",
        "In addition, given the structural nature of the problems besetting the global economy, comprehensive solution would take time.",
        "As such, the option for monetary stimulus should be retained until there was greater clarity on the impact of the global economy on Thai economy.",
        "The MPC therefore voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 3 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments in the global economy and domestic demand conditions, and stood ready to take appropriate policy actions.",
        "Global financial market sentiment improved since the last meeting on the back of further progress toward the euro debt crisis resolution, as Germany’s constitutional court had ruled in favour of German participation in the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).",
        "Further monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank also contributed positively to investor confidence, which led to more foreign capital inflows into Asian equity and bond markets and the appreciation of regional currencies including the Thai baht against the US dollar.",
        "However, pressure on the Thai Baht stemming from the third round of US quantitative easing (QE3) was expected to be more limited in comparison with QE1 and QE2 partly due to more attractive investment returns in other emerging markets, especially Latin America.",
        "Short-term government bond yields edged up from the last meeting and stayed at a level close to the policy rate in the period leading up to this meeting, reflecting market expectation that the MPC would keep the policy rate unchanged.",
        "Medium- and long-term government bond yields were volatile, rising in tandem with higher US bond yields and greater-thanexpected bond supply announced by the government, then edging lower on the back of capital inflows into the bond market.",
        "The global economy remained weak despite some bright spot in the US economy with improvements in production, employment, and consumer confidence.",
        "QE3 was expected to play a limited role in stimulating the US economy as commercial banks’ credit standard remained tight and the impact on the real estate sector, capital market and investment would take time to materialise given uncertainties pertaining to the fallout of the euro debt crisis and the US fiscal cliff.",
        "The euro zone economy remained in recession and was likely to weaken further due to challenges in policy implementation.",
        "The situation in Spain, in particular, could potentially deteriorate and undermine market confidence.",
        "Weak global demand had weighed more heavily on Asian economies than expected.",
        "Contraction of Asian exports to major economies persisted and could be compounded by China’s economic slowdown.",
        "However, some regional economies continued to expand fairly well on account of robust domestic demand which helped to cushion somewhat the negative impact from the global economy.",
        "Global inflationary pressure was subdued in line with weak global demand.",
        "A few central banks recently cut policy rates in response to the below-target inflation rates and more evident slowdown in domestic economy, but most central banks kept the policy rates unchanged.",
        "The MPC assessed the economic growth in the third quarter to be close to projection.",
        "Private consumption and investment continued to be the main growth drivers.",
        "Key supporting factors included high household income, favourable labour market conditions, strong consumer confidence, government stimulus measures such as the first-car tax rebate programme, as well as accommodative monetary conditions as evident from strong private credit expansion.",
        "The MPC viewed that credit growth in the corporate sector was consistent with domestic investment cycle, and the expansion in mortgage loans was not yet a cause for concern, as commercial banks still maintained prudent credit standards and households’ debt servicing abilities remained intact.",
        "However, the exceptionally high growth in non-mortgage loans should be closely monitored, with particular attention to be paid to low-income households, in order to guard against a potential build-up of financial imbalances.",
        "In contrast with domestic demand performance, external demand was weaker than previously assessed, as reflected by more-than-expected contraction in exports and export production.",
        "Business sentiment in the export-oriented sector started to show sign of weakening, pointing to more sluggish investment in the export sector relative to the domestic sector in the period ahead.",
        "Leading indicators such as new export orders suggested that recovery in exports would be unlikely this year, although there might be some seasonal pickup in the last quarter.",
        "Overall, the MPC assessed this year’s economic growth to be close to the previous projection of 5.7 percent, but growth for 2013 was revised down to 4.6 percent from 5.0 percent.",
        "The revision was mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the global impact could spill over to private investment, which was already moderating as post-flood reconstruction and investment tapered off, and (2) government investment spending was likely to be partially delayed.",
        "However, it should be noted that additional spending under the government’s 2.27 trillion baht infrastructure investment plan had not been incorporated into this projection.",
        "In the event that part of this plan could be rolled out within 2013, the economy would gain more traction and the growth outturn could be higher than the baseline projection.",
        "Private consumption was expected to grow steadily.",
        "Inflationary outlook was unchanged from the last meeting, with core inflation forecast remaining at 2.1 and 1.7 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively.",
        "All MPC members agreed that uncertainties surrounding the global economy remained high and the impact of global slowdown on regional economies was significant.",
        "Exports could be more negatively affected by weakening global demand in the period ahead, but Thai economy would continue to expand on the back of strong domestic demand under benign inflation outlook.",
        "However, members differed in their assessment of risks going forward and thus the need for policy easing.",
        "Five members deemed a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum to be appropriate given that Thai exports and export production would deteriorate due to greaterthan-expected slowdown in the Chinese and regional economies.",
        "Although domestic demand was helping to sustain the overall economic momentum, it might not be sufficient to cushion the impact of export slowdown going forward as the strength of private demand would be undermined by moderating private investment and expiring government stimulus, such as the tax rebate programme.",
        "Furthermore, significant acceleration of government spending appeared unlikely.",
        "Against this backdrop, a policy rate reduction at this meeting would act to shore up domestic demand and would also serve to signal firms to prepare for the possibly heightened risk of economic slowdown in the period ahead.",
        "Two members viewed that a reduction in interest rate differentials between Thailand and major economies would also help to slow down foreign capital inflows, although the effect was likely to be limited given that interest rate differential was shown by studies not to be the main driver of capital inflows, especially in comparison with market expectation of currency gain, global investor sentiment, and cross-country differentials in economic fundamentals and growth prospect.",
        "Two members deemed that maintaining the policy rate at 3.00 percent per annum was justified on the basis that, despite high uncertainties besetting the global economy, signs of recovery had begun to emerge.",
        "Next year’s global economic expansion was projected to be slightly higher than this year, and the probability of tail events had diminished thanks to additional policy measures undertaken by the G3 economies.",
        "Overall Thai economy continued to grow on a well-balanced path despite negative global impact, with domestic demand expanding firmly and inflation remaining within target.",
        "Moreover, in light of the already accommodative monetary conditions and high private credit growth, lower interest rates could induce risks to financial stability.",
        "Policy rate should therefore be put on hold, until there is greater clarity on the overall balance of risks to the economy.",
        "The MPC therefore voted 5 to 2 to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 3.00 percent",
        "Stability of global financial markets improved since the last meeting on the back of positive outturns in key economic indicators in Germany and France, as well as better than expected US retail sales.",
        "The resultant strengthening of investor confidence led to a reallocation of investments towards higher-risk assets, and capital inflows into Asian equity and bond markets resumed.",
        "Against this backdrop, regional currencies, including the Thai baht, appreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Short-term money market interest rates and government bond yields remained generally steady, reflecting overall market expectations that the MPC would keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting, although some investors projected policy easing within this year.",
        "Despite improvement in global financial markets, the global economy remained weak.",
        "US economic recovery proceeded at a gradual pace with consumption and investment expenditures remaining below normal levels.",
        "The impending expiration of fiscal stimulus measures posed a significant risk to the recovery.",
        "The euro zone economy entered recession and was projected to weaken further in the latter half of this year as a result of tighter government spending and markedly lower private sector confidence.",
        "In addition, the viability of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) remained uncertain pending a ruling by Germany’s constitutional court on the legality of German participation in the mechanism.",
        "Such implementation risks could delay the resolution of the euro zone debt crisis.",
        "The impact of a weakening global economy on Chinese and Asian economies became more evident, with export growth slowing down to a greater extent than anticipated.",
        "Nonetheless, in a number of countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, growth in the latest quarter remained solid on the back of strong domestic demand.",
        "Global inflationary pressure remained low.",
        "Despite some increase in prices of agricultural products due to unfavourable weather conditions, pass-through onto consumer prices was limited by weak global demand.",
        "Most central banks kept their policy rates unchanged, opting to wait for greater clarity on key developments that could significantly impact the global economic outlook.",
        "In some cases where domestic demand had clearly deteriorated, monetary policy was eased.",
        "The Thai economy in the second quarter expanded more than previously projected.",
        "Strong momentum in consumption and investment was likely to sustain a positive trend in domestic demand going forward.",
        "Key supporting factors included strong private sector confidence, favourable labour market conditions, higher household income, and accommodative monetary conditions, which was particularly evident from the robust expansion of credit.",
        "Government stimulus measures also continued to contribute positively to domestic growth, though disbursement on some projects, such as on investment slated under the Water Management Decree, had been partially delayed.",
        "The impact of slowing global demand on Thai exports became more apparent, with exports to major industrialised countries particularly affected.",
        "As a result, overall export growth in 2012 could turn out to be lower than that projected in the last meeting.",
        "The MPC assessed that GDP growth for 2012 remained close to the previous forecast as robust expansion in private consumption and investment would help to cushion the impact of the weakening global economy on Thai exports.",
        "Nonetheless, economic growth in 2013 would likely be softer than previously projected given a more pronounced impact from the global economy as well as some delay in the disbursement of government stimulus measures.",
        "Price pressure moderated in line with the weaker global economic outlook, and inflation was forecasted to remain close to the midpoint of the target range going forward.",
        "The MPC viewed that strong private credit expansion reflected a positive underlying momentum for domestic demand as well as strong willingness on the part of financial institutions to extend loans.",
        "Nonetheless, some members expressed concerns regarding the unusually high growth rate observed on certain types of credit, such as automobile loans, personal loans and a subset of real estate loans, which warranted close monitoring to guard against a potential build-up of financial imbalances.",
        "All MPC members agreed that the balance of risks for the Thai economy was skewed more towards growth rather than inflation.",
        "While domestic demand remained robust, the impact of slowing global demand on Thai exports was expected to increase in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, inflationary pressure remained moderate.",
        "In this context, further monetary policy easing could help to support economic activity.",
        "However, members differed in their assessment of the conditions that would warrant such an easing.",
        "Two members viewed that a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum was justified given that: (1) Thai exports would become increasingly weighed down by the weakening global economy.",
        "Despite domestic demand remaining firm currently, support from fiscal stimulus measures would be more muted, while the temporary boost from flood-related private investment would wane going forward, and the positive contribution from the government’s first-car tax rebate programme would run out in the near term; and (2) considering the time lag with which monetary policy actions transmit to the economy, a policy rate reduction at this meeting would act to shore up economic activity next year and would also serve to signal firms to prepare for possibly heightened risk in the period ahead.",
        "Three members assessed that maintaining the policy rate at 3.0 percent per annum was appropriate on the basis that: (1) a policy rate reduction could not directly compensate for the adverse impact of weaker external demand on export.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand remained robust and sufficient to support economic growth; (2) monetary conditions remained accommodative and already supportive of economic activity with continued strong expansion in private credit.",
        "Given high growth rates in certain types of credit, close monitoring was warranted to guard against potential imbalances and a policy rate reduction may exacerbate such risks; and (3) the global economy remained susceptible to tail risks and it was important to preserve the room for monetary policy to act quickly should global economic conditions deteriorate rapidly.",
        "The MPC therefore voted 3 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 3.0 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments in the global economy, domestic demand conditions as well as private credit growth, and stood ready to take appropriate policy actions as warranted.",
        "On April 17, 2012, the Cabinet approved the monetary policy target for 2012 proposed by the Ministry of Finance to maintain the target range for quarterly average core inflation of 0.5–3.0 percent per annum, which was deemed appropriate given the current economic situation.",
        "Market confidence improved temporarily before declining from concern over sovereign debt problems in Spain and Italy.",
        "Major currencies strengthened as investors once again turned to safe-haven assets.",
        "The bilateral Thai baht exchange rate remained roughly unchanged from the previous meeting, with lower volatility in line with regional currencies.",
        "This was attributable to more balanced capital flows, partly due to an increase in demand for US dollars by gold and oil importers.",
        "Short-term money market interest rates stabilized in line with the policy rate, reflecting market expectations that the MPC would keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bangkok Interbank Offer Rate (BIBOR) of maturity greater than 3 months increased in tandem with higher short-term government bond yields, reflecting market expectations that the policy rate might be adjusted upward in the next 3 – 6 months.",
        "The global economy continued to grow at a gradual pace with improving signs of recovery in the major economies.",
        "US economic outlook improved on the back of positive developments in the labor market and income prospects, as well as stronger private sector confidence.",
        "Meanwhile, the eurozone economy entered a recession and it would take time for the structural problems to be resolved.",
        "Nevertheless, the MPC assessed that the overall eurozone economy might suffer less severe contraction than previously thought, based on more positive leading indicators in manufacturing and export sectors in core countries.",
        "Although problems in Spain might affect market confidence somewhat, it was anticipated that they could be contained by the Spanish and European authorities.",
        "Economic growth in Asia softened in line with moderation in exports.",
        "Nonetheless, a gradual pickup in exports towards the end of the second quarter was expected following an increase in new export orders, particularly for exports of intermediate goods and electronic parts to China.",
        "This was in line with the anticipated strengthening of the global economic recovery in the latter half of this year.",
        "Some MPC members expressed concern over growing political uncertainties in both Europe and Asia, which could hinder the resolution process for sovereign debt in Europe and remained a risk factor to Asia’s economic recovery.",
        "Global inflation remained stable relative to the previous meeting, though pressure from an elevated oil price level persisted.",
        "The MPC noted that the extraordinary easing of monetary policy by major industrial economies could be one of the factors adding to higher global inflationary pressure in the periods ahead.",
        "Most central banks kept policy interest rates unchanged opting to wait for greater clarity on the outlook for global economic recovery and inflation.",
        "The recovery of the Thai economy in the first quarter was faster than expected.",
        "Production of most flood-affected manufacturing firms has returned to pre-flood levels while some of those unaffected has accelerated their production.",
        "On the whole, manufacturing production was projected to return to normal levels by the end of the second quarter this year, earlier than the third quarter projected previously.",
        "Private consumption and investment accelerated as supply shortages eased, consumer and business confidence strengthened, and domestic purchasing power increased due to favorable income conditions in both farm and non-farm sectors.",
        "Exports were expected to rebound sooner than previously assessed in tandem with the recovery of manufacturing production and the anticipated pickup in global demand.",
        "Government stimulus measures and accommodative monetary conditions would continue to support sustained economic recovery going forward.",
        "In light of the broad-based recovery, which has been faster than expected with good momentum evident in all components, the MPC adjusted GDP growth projection for 2012 upward to 6.0 percent from Inflation slowed down in April partly as a result of the high base of the previous year and the reduction of some fresh food prices back to their normal levels.",
        "The moderation in inflationary pressure was expected to be temporary given that several items in the CPI basket, such as electricity charge and public transportation fare, are in the process of upward price adjustment.",
        "Moreover, elevated oil prices and the minimum wage hike in the context of a strong pickup in domestic demand, as well as heightened public concern over the rising cost of living, could add to higher inflation expectations.",
        "This, in turn, could result in a greater pass-through of higher costs to prices of goods and services.",
        "The MPC deemed it too early to assess the full impact of the minimum wage hike on inflation at this point, and would continue to monitor and appraise the effect as more information becomes available.",
        "The MPC suggested that communication regarding the role of monetary policy in tackling inflationary risks should be enhanced to foster a common understanding with the public.",
        "Emphasis should be placed, in particular, on the importance of demand management and anchoring inflation expectations in attaining price stability.",
        "Regardless of the immediate cause of inflation pressure in the short-term, its persistence and impact on overall price stability in the long run hinges on the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "The MPC assessed that the recent easing of monetary policy has helped to shore up private sector confidence and contributed to a broad-based recovery which has been faster than expected.",
        "The global economic outlook appeared more positive, particularly with respect to major economies, while the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone was not expected to deteriorate much further.",
        "However, the recovery of global economy remains fragile amidst high uncertainties especially regarding the lingering structural problems in the eurozone economy which would take time to resolve.",
        "This continues to be a risk factor for Thailand’s economic recovery.",
        "Some members viewed that the faster-than-expected recovery of the Thai economy in the first quarter was partly due to the acceleration in production as well as private consumption and investment as part of flood-related replacement and restoration spending, which could moderate in the following quarters.",
        "It was thus important to closely monitor incoming information to obtain a clear bearing on the strength of the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Although inflation might have moderated in April and remained within a manageable level, upside risks to inflation continued to persist.",
        "Thus, it is necessary to closely monitor factors that could affect the dynamics of inflationary process, especially public concern over the rising cost of living which could fuel inflation expectations in the periods ahead.",
        "In weighing the balance of risks, the MPC deemed the current policy interest rate to be appropriate in supporting a sustained recovery of economic activity to normal levels in the face of remaining risks in the global economy while still consistent with keeping inflation within target.",
        "The MPC, therefore, voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 3.0 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments of the key risk factors and stands ready to take appropriate policy action in response to material shifts in the balance of risks.",
        "The MPC discussed the appropriateness of policy rate renormalization in the upcoming periods.",
        "The recent temporary easing of monetary policy was aimed at preventing deterioration in domestic demand, especially weaker business confidence, from aggravating the impact of the flood on the economy.",
        "Given that economic recovery has gained traction with robust momentum going forward amidst sustained rise in private sector confidence, the need for current exceptional policy accommodation should continue to decline.",
        "Meanwhile, the rise in inflationary pressure reinforced the need to renormalize the policy rate at an appropriate time.",
        "Market confidence improved following significant progress in debt restructuring for Greece and long-term liquidity provision by the European Central Bank.",
        "Improved market sentiment prompted a resumption of capital inflows into regional equity and bond markets, contributing to the appreciation of most regional currencies including the Thai baht.",
        "Some MPC members viewed that while the euro zone’s debt crisis may have abated, structural problems underlying the crisis remained unresolved.",
        "Thus, the possibility that the crisis may escalate again remained a key risk to the global economic outlook.",
        "This was reflected by continued market unease about sovereign debt problem in other countries, such as Spain and Portugal.",
        "Volatility of the Thai baht picked up recently, particularly from late February to early March, driven by fluctuations in the US dollar, surges in capital flows in tandem with shifting market sentiment, and flood-related insurance payouts.",
        "The MPC noted improvements in Thai firms’ ability to adjust to the baht volatility.",
        "Money market interest rates and short-term government bond yields stabilized around 3 percent per annum, reflecting market expectations that the MPC might keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "Medium and long-term government bond yields increased in tandem with higher US treasuries’ yields on the back of an improved economic outlook and an anticipated pickup in inflationary pressure.",
        "The expected rise in government bond supply associated with flood-related spending also contributed to higher bond yields.",
        "The global economy continued to grow at a slow pace but with lower downside risk as reflected in positive signals from a number of economic indicators.",
        "The US economic outlook became more positive in light of improvements in the labor market, both in manufacturing and service sectors, as well as higher business and consumer confidence.",
        "The euro zone economy entered into a recession, though the contraction probably might not be as severe or prolonged as earlier feared, given that the debt crisis had abated somewhat and the German economy remained robust with relatively low unemployment, low private sector debt, and continued improvement in business confidence.",
        "Economic growth in Asia softened slightly in line with recent moderation in exports.",
        "Going forward, however, export outlook was positive as the shortage of parts caused by flooding in Thailand had abated and the US economy continued to recover.",
        "Latest figures indicated further improvements in new export orders in Taiwan, Korea, China, and Singapore, especially for electronic goods, which formed the bulk of exports from Asia.",
        "Inflationary pressure increased from rising global oil prices as a result of tensions in the Middle East, and slightly higher commodity prices.",
        "Nonetheless, the MPC judged that the pressure would not be as severe as in 2008, since the conflict was expected to be contained and unlikely to result in war.",
        "It was also noted that oil price increases driven by supply factors typically do not persist for very long, compared with those resulting from higher demand.",
        "Against the backdrop of a more positive global economic outlook and higher risks to inflation, most central banks decided to keep the stance of policy unchanged.",
        "The exceptions were due to country-specific reasons, such as the Philippines where monetary policy was eased in light of a decline in inflationary pressure on account of domestic factors.",
        "The economic recovery in Thailand gained traction with consumption and private investment accelerating faster than previously anticipated.",
        "The payment of insurance claims may be delayed in a number of cases due to the drawn-out assessment process and a shortage of manpower to verify claims.",
        "However, this did not impede business investment since most flood-affected firms had a number of funding sources: own funds, financial support from parent companies abroad, credit from commercial banks, and interim payments from insurance companies.",
        "Nevertheless, the purchase and installation of machinery for some companies that rely on advanced technologies may take longer.",
        "Overall the MPC anticipated most economic activities to return to normal by the second quarter of this year.",
        "The main exception was the manufacturing sector, where normal production levels were expected to resume in the third quarter, paving the way for a steady recovery in exports.",
        "Accommodative monetary policy and government stimulus measures continued to underpin economic growth.",
        "The government’s budget disbursement on water management projects was expected to take place at a faster pace than previously forecasted as some projects had already been approved in March.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to grow by sectors, while external demand was expected to play a larger role in the latter half of this year as the anticipated recovery in the global economy takes hold and exports return to their normal levels.",
        "Overall, recent improvements in the global economy had reduced downside risks to Thailand’s economic growth.",
        "Inflationary pressure and their expectations were projected to remain stable in the short-run, but there are upside risks stemming from rising global oil prices, a pick-up in domestic demand in the latter half of this year, and government stimulus measures, especially the minimum wage hike which comes into effect in April 2012.",
        "On the other hand, the postponement of the reinstatement of the oil excise tax would help lessen the effect of rising global oil prices on domestic inflation.",
        "The MPC assessed that the reduction in the policy rate over the last two meetings had helped to shore up the Thai economy, with good momentum evident in all major components.",
        "In light of lower risks from the global economy, further easing of monetary policy was not needed.",
        "Nevertheless, the structural problems underlying the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone had not been directly addressed and could flare up again.",
        "With the recovery of the Thai economy only just beginning and considering potential implementation delays in government stimulus measures, an accommodative monetary policy stance was deemed appropriate in supporting economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "At the same time, risks to inflation became more elevated mainly from global oil prices and progressively more pronounced demand pressure as the Thai economy moves closer to potential, implying a possible pickup in inflationary pressure in the latter half of this year.",
        "Although this price trend was in line with the earlier assessment and the level remained manageable, more caution was warranted.",
        "A few members expressed their concern that inflationary risks may rise further from domestic factors, such as the unprecedented hike in the minimum wage, as well as external developments including the enormous injection of liquidity by central banks of advanced economies.",
        "These were important risk factors that the MPC would monitor closely.",
        "The MPC deemed the current level of the policy rate to be appropriate in supporting economic recovery in the face of remaining risks in the global economy while still consistent with keeping inflation within target.",
        "The MPC, therefore, voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 3.00 percent per annum.",
        "In regard to the monetary policy target for 2012, the MPC viewed that the proposal to adopt headline inflation (annual average headline inflation of 3.0 ± 1.5 percent per annum) as a monetary policy target remained appropriate.",
        "In the long run, this would help enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy communication and strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "The Ministry of Finance and related agencies, after discussing the matter in accordance with the cabinet resolution, agreed in principle on the adoption of the new target, but suggested the postponement of the change.",
        "This was due to a number of special factors this year, such as a sharp rise in global oil prices from international geopolitical tensions and reform of the structure of domestic energy prices, which may result in undue volatility of headline inflation.",
        "In order to ensure a smooth transition, the MPC agreed to postpone the adoption of the new monetary policy target to a more appropriate time and retained the current target (quarterly average core inflation of 0.5 – 3.0 percent) for this year.",
        "The MPC would continue to monitor both core and headline inflation as usual, and communicate its policy deliberations in terms of both measures with increasing emphasis on the headline inflation to foster public understanding from this point forward.",
        "In terms of oil price developments, the MPC would continue to monitor their impact on headline inflation and the transmission to core inflation.",
        "Recently, the pressure had indeed increased, resulting in a slight upward revision to the inflation forecast.",
        "In any case, the focus of monetary policy would be on addressing potential second round effects from demand pressure and developments in inflation expectations, regardless of whether headline or core inflation was used as the policy target.",
        "The lack of a clear resolution to the euro zone’s sovereign debt problem has resulted in further declines in investor confidence and continued volatility in financial markets.",
        "Nevertheless, central bank liquidity injection along with increased preparedness of the private sector to deal with eventual outcomes has helped calm market sentiment.",
        "The recent credit ratings downgrade of several economies in the euro zone pressured markets only temporarily and to a lesser extent than expected.",
        "US dollar liquidity in global financial markets eased slightly.",
        "The Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar and other regional currencies as a result of a slowdown in Thai exports due to the recent floods and capital outflow on the back of elevated concern about the global economy, which increased desired holdings of US dollar assets.",
        "Money market interest rates and short-term government bond yields tended downward, reflecting the market’s expectation of a reduction in the policy rate in this MPC meeting.",
        "The global economic outlook has weakened further with the euro area facing the risk of a prolonged recession.",
        "The conjunction of tighter credit markets, limited fiscal policy space, and credit rating downgrades of several euro economies and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has complicated the resolution to the region’s sovereign debt problem.",
        "On the other hand, the US economy showed signs of improvement with continued expansion in employment and stronger consumer confidence.",
        "However, limited fiscal policy space, continued weakness in the housing market together with the impact from the euro zone’s debt crisis would constrain economic growth in the periods ahead to remain below potential.",
        "Meanwhile, the repercussions of the euro zone’s problem on Asia became more evident through trade-related channels, while its impact on the financial sector remained contained.",
        "The softening global economy contributed to a moderation in the prices of food and various commodities, leading to lower global inflationary pressure.",
        "The impact of the floods on the Thai economy was greater than previously anticipated, leading to a sharp contraction in economic activity in the last quarter of 2011.",
        "Although the recovery process in the manufacturing sector has already begun, the restoration of production to normal capacity is expected to be more prolonged than previously assessed.",
        "The delay reflects the greater severity of damages, which would take more time to repair and also require more extensive replacement of machineries, as well as the drawn-out damage assessment process in claiming insurance payouts.",
        "Exports decelerated on the back of flood induced supply chain disruption and the softening global economy.",
        "Nonetheless, improving consumer confidence, government stimulus measures, and accommodative monetary conditions would help support the revival of private consumption.",
        "Short-term inflationary pressure declined, reflecting a more prolonged recovery in domestic demand and reduction in production costs from lower non-oil commodity prices, in line with the softer trend in global inflation.",
        "Nonetheless, upside risks to inflation remained from the possibility of higher oil prices resulting from unrest in the Middle East, as well as changes in the excise tax on oil and a higher contribution rate to the oil fund.",
        "In addition, higher wages and government stimulus measures would add to upward inflationary pressure as economic activity returns to normal in the second half of 2012.",
        "The MPC assessed that the downside risks to growth has increased due to protracted weaknesses in the global economy as well as a post-flood recovery process of the Thai economy that will be more drawn out than expected.",
        "With upside risks to inflation contained, monetary policy could be eased further to help accelerate the return of economic activity to normal levels, especially as private sector confidence, albeit improving, continues to be fragile.",
        "The MPC therefore voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 3.25 percent to 3.00 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC noted that rapidly increasing market share of specialized financial institutions banking system, especially in deposit mobilization where the SFIs have a clear cost advantage.",
        "In this circumstance, commercial banks’ ability to adjust their interest rates in line with official policy rate may have been limited.",
        "Thus, monetary policy’s support to economic restoration efforts through lower cost of funds for the private sector has also been limited.",
        "The MPC stressed the importance of policy coordination from all relevant authorities in resolving this structural problem in the banking system.",
        "Global financial market sentiment improved thanks to progress in policy measures to resolve the eurozone debt crisis and apparent efforts in the US to avert the “fiscal cliff” problem.",
        "Stock market indices of major countries edged higher while major currencies appreciated, except the Japanese yen which depreciated as investors anticipated further monetary policy easing after the upcoming election in December.",
        "Capital inflows to the region’s equity and bond markets started to moderate.",
        "The Thai baht moved within a narrow range in tandem with regional currencies.",
        "Money market rates in Thailand as well as short to medium-term government bond yields edged lower following the MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate at the previous meeting.",
        "However, long-term bond yields rose due to greater-than-expected supply of government bonds in November.",
        "The commercial banks’ lending and borrowing rates were lowered in response to the policy rate cut.",
        "Most market participants expected the MPC to maintain the policy rate at this meeting.",
        "The overall global economy showed signs of stabilisation and improving prospects.",
        "Most US economic indicators released were better than expected and pointed to increasing consumer spending.",
        "Signs of recovery in the housing sector and the labour market, together with higher consumer confidence could contribute to greater private investment in the periods ahead.",
        "The eurozone economy contracted in 2012 Q3, but the economic and financial outlook of the region was projected to be more stable next year as crisis resolution measures should become more concrete and the economies of core countries continued to hold up.",
        "Nonetheless, the MPC viewed that the eurozone debt crisis and the fiscal cliff problem in the US remained uncertain and continued to pose major risks to the global economic outlook.",
        "Japan’s economy contracted from the previous quarter following the slowdown in exports, domestic consumption and investment.",
        "China’s economy appeared to regain traction with recent strengthening in key areas including exports, production, domestic consumption and investment, which should bode well for a continued recovery in the fourth quarter and into next year.",
        "Asian economies improved on the back of better export performance and a pick-up in the Chinese economy, as well as continued buoyant domestic demand.",
        "The MPC noted that Thailand’s trade with neighbouring countries continued to expand despite the global economic slowdown, reflecting an increased importance of these economies going forward.",
        "Since the last meeting, most central banks assessed that the global economy had shown signs of stabilisation while inflation remained subdued.",
        "Hence, most had decided to keep policy interest rates unchanged while awaiting greater clarity on domestic and international developments.",
        "The Thai economy in 2012 Q3 expanded at a rate close to the previous meeting’s projection as greater-than-expected strength in domestic demand offset the adverse impacts of the global economy.",
        "This was partly attributable to faster delivery of cars under the government’s first-car tax rebate scheme and more-than-expected post-flood reconstruction investment, along with an upward trend in industrial production for domestic markets.",
        "Adverse impacts of the global economy appeared to have been limited to export-related sectors, while exports should begin to pick up during the first half of 2013 on the back of anticipated improvement in the global economy.",
        "The MPC viewed that private consumption and investment would continue to serve as the main drivers of growth.",
        "Key supporting factors included favourable household incomes, good employment prospects, strong consumers’ confidence, and accommodative financial conditions as evident by high credit growth.",
        "Against this backdrop, the MPC noted lessons from past economic crises that a prolonged period of low interest rates could lead to a build-up of financial imbalances in the economy, and thus deemed it necessary to closely monitor high growth of certain types of credits.",
        "In addition, if warranted, macroprudential measures could also be used along with the policy interest rate to ensure financial stability.",
        "Overall, the MPC assessed that GDP growth for 2012 and 2013 could be slightly higher than the previous forecast, due mainly to better outlook for private consumption and investment.",
        "Looking ahead, subject to continued stabilisation of the global economy, export sector could regain its role as a growth driver in the latter half of 2013, should domestic demand moderate following the expiration of government’s stimulus measures.",
        "Inflation outlook for 2012 and The MPC assessed that the balance of risks for the Thai economy remained skewed towards growth rather than inflation.",
        "While global risks had lessened somewhat, uncertainties surrounding the global economy remained high.",
        "As such, an accommodative monetary policy stance was deemed necessary and appropriate to sustain ongoing economic expansion.",
        "Key issues raised during policy deliberation could be summarised as follows: than the last meeting while the latest Thai economic indicators showed better-than-expected domestic demand.",
        "Both private consumption and investment remained robust with continuing momentum.",
        "While exports and export-related production figures suggested continued external headwinds, domestic demand should help mitigate their impacts.",
        "Furthermore, the policy rate reduction in the previous meeting had provided insurance against external risks to a certain extent.",

        "meeting, tail risks remained substantial.",
        "Thus, it was important to preserve policy space for extended by Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs), maintaining a low policy interest rate for an extensive period could accumulate greater risks to financial stability.",
        "The MPC therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.75 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring global and domestic economic developments and stand ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted."

    "2017": [
        "The overall growth outlook for Thailand’s trading partner economies improved from the previous meeting.",
        "Most economies recorded stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2017, with indicators of manufacturing production and global trade volume reflecting a continued recovery.",
        "G3 economies continued to expand on the back of private consumption while private investment gradually improved.",
        "The US economy slowed down more than expected in the first quarter on account of private consumption, which softened from temporary factors including previous acceleration in auto sales and delayed income tax refunds.",
        "Nevertheless, sound economic fundamentals, particularly employment and private sector confidence, should help support domestic demand and economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "Asian economies continued to recover, driven by improved exports to G3 and regional economies, especially China.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy was expected to continue expanding.",
        "However, certain structural problems, including elevated private sector debt particularly in emerging market economies and moderation in productivity growth after the global financial crisis, might impede the global economic recovery going forward.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to slowly rise in most economies.",
        "Core inflation remained broadly stable partly due to the weaker relationship between economic growth and inflation than in the past.",
        "In addition, major and regional central banks kept their policy interest rates The balance of risks to global economic recovery was largely unchanged from the previous assessment and remained skewed to the downside.",
        "The Committee assessed geopolitical risks to increase amid conflicts over the Korean peninsula.",
        "Some members viewed that global financial markets might become more volatile if such risks were to intensify.",
        "Risks associated with the US economic and foreign trade policies as well as China’s economic structural reform remained in line with the previous assessments but still warranted close monitoring.",
        "Political concerns in Europe eased following the results of the French election.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee viewed China’s one-notch credit rating downgrade on 23 May 2017 as a realization of risks previously identified.",
        "Under the Committee’s view, key issues that warranted monitoring in the period ahead included (1) the impact of interest rate and balance sheet normalization by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and (2) the US tax reform policies with respect to repatriated earnings and their implications for cross-border capital flows.",
        "Moreover, the Committee assessed that the Fed would raise its policy rate twice over the remainder of 2017 in line with market expectations.",
        "The Committee also expected that the Fed’s balance sheet normalization would likely proceed at a gradual pace, which would help facilitate expectations formation and orderly adjustments in financial markets.",
        "The overall sentiment in global financial markets improved.",
        "The global economic recovery became more positive and political concerns in Europe eased, while conflicts over the Korean peninsula did not trigger significant concerns among investors.",
        "Consequently, prices of safehaven assets including gold and the Japanese yen fell.",
        "Nonetheless, in mid-May investors were increasingly concerned over the political situation in the US and came to expect that further hikes in the federal funds rate this year might be less certain.",
        "Market expectations about the gradual monetary policy normalization in G3 economies and the improved global economic outlook led to capital inflows to bond and equity markets in the region including Thailand.",
        "However, capital inflows to Thailand were smaller in size compared with inflows to other countries in the region.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index declined on account of a fall in the prices of energy and bank equities respectively following the drop in global oil prices and increases in non-performing loans (NPLs) in the first quarter.",
        "With regard to the exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar to a greater extent than other regional currencies due to the accelerated US dollar purchases by gold-trading companies when gold prices dropped and the repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign businesses in Thailand.",
        "Thus, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) depreciated from the previous meeting.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term Thai government bond yields edged lower mainly due to reduced issuance of Bank of Thailand (BOT) bills.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term money market rates remained close to the policy rate and mediumto long-term Thai government bond yields were around the same levels as in the previous meeting.",
        "The overall costs of borrowing declined following the recent cuts in lending rates by some commercial banks, which resulted in more accommodative financial conditions.",
        "It was expected that capital flow and exchange rate movements would remain volatile in the period ahead depending on (1) the actual implementation of US economic policies, (2) the political situation in the US, and (3) market expectations about the pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization.",
        "Consequently, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor short-term capital flows especially those invested in short-term instruments.",
        "The Committee discussed the reasons why investors did not give much consideration for geopolitical risks, as reflected by the continued increases in global equity indices.",
        "Some members viewed that investors might regard such risks as tail risks, which could be difficult and costly to hedge against, and that investors might be confident about the clearer global economic recovery.",
        "As a result, investors did not significantly adjust their risky asset position.",
        "Were geopolitical risks to materialize, risky assets in global financial markets might experience a sharp correction in prices.",
        "The Thai economy grew faster than previously expected in the first quarter of 2017, recording a growth rate of 3.3 percent from the same period last year.",
        "Growth was primarily driven by an increasingly broad-based expansion in merchandise exports to almost all destinations, especially China, and in many export categories, particularly electronics that picked up thanks to the uptrend of Internet of Things (IoT) products.",
        "Private consumption continued to expand on the back of expenditure on services and durable goods, especially cars, which rose across many regions supported by higher farm income and improved consumer confidence.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism and public expenditure continued to expand.",
        "Nevertheless, private investment growth remained mostly limited to export-related businesses, consistent with loan growth that was concentrated in certain industries.",
        "The Committee assessed that Thailand’s growth outlook improved further mainly on account of better-than-expected growth in merchandise exports as Thailand’s trading partner economies gained momentum.",
        "However, the export recovery still faced risks stemming from uncertainties in US foreign trade policies which continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "The recovery in tourism was expected to continue.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption was expected to grow at a gradual pace.",
        "Nevertheless, the purchasing power of some agricultural households remained limited due to the debt burden following the severe drought last year.",
        "At the same time, non-farm income growth slowed down somewhat as growth in the manufacturing sector was largely limited to capital intensive industries.",
        "Unemployment, while remaining low overall, recently saw some increases among the new entrants which might reflect structural unemployment.",
        "Private investment was expected to slowly gain momentum as demand picked up, which would help to gradually reduce excess capacity.",
        "However, businesses still faced significant uncertainties on many fronts that might affect their investment decisions, including geopolitics, future technological trends, the direction of US foreign trade policies, and potential labor shortage in Thailand due to population aging.",
        "Additionally, some Committee members viewed that the slowdown in investment could be attributed to the fact that businesses still kept their hurdle rates at a high level as in the past, despite significant declines in financing costs over recent periods which could partly reflect some increase in risks.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee expected public expenditure to continue to play an important role in boosting economic growth, although public investment would likely moderate somewhat due mainly to limited budget disbursement by some state-owned enterprises.",
        "Headline inflation was softer than expected in March and April 2017 on account of lower prices of fresh food, especially vegetable and fruits, due to (1) this year’s higher output as rainfall exceeded normal levels and (2) last year’s base effect because of the drought.",
        "Headline inflation might thus fall below the lower bound of the target in some period primarily due to supply-side factors.",
        "Core inflation remained stable at low levels in line with low demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee assessed that headline inflation would trend up in the latter half of the year driven by cyclical factors, which included an expected rise in global oil prices alongside the global economic recovery, an increase in electricity costs in the second half of in tandem with economic growth.",
        "The positive effects of these cyclical factors on inflation were expected to help counteract the negative effects of structural factors, including aging population and an expansion of e-commerce, which could become more prominent in the period ahead.",
        "Overall, most Committee members assessed that the decline in headline inflation over the past two months was a result of temporary supply-side factors.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to rise over the latter half of the year in tandem with economic growth and as the base effect of higher fresh food prices last year dissipated.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s mediumterm inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "Nevertheless, some Committee members viewed that headline inflation might fall below the lower bound of the target in some period and saw the need to assess factors, both cyclical and structural, that might affect the inflation outlook in a comprehensive manner.",
        "The expansion of commercial bank loans remained low overall.",
        "Loans extended to large businesses and small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) continued to grow but were largely concentrated in some business sectors.",
        "Nevertheless, business financing through the bond market continued to increase.",
        "Meanwhile, consumer loan growth slowed down in almost all categories except for auto loans, which remained contracting albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Credit quality continued to deteriorate as reflected in rising NPLs especially among business loans extended to SMEs and mortgage loans, as well as increasing credit migration to lower credit quality among SMEs, which continued to warrant close monitoring going forward.",
        "In any case, financial institutions maintained high levels of loan loss provision and capital buffers, which provided cushion against potential risk from deterioration in credit quality.",
        "Some Committee members noted that the deterioration in credit quality partly reflected the fact that current economic growth was not yet broad-based and might be a result of ongoing structural changes, including (1) the greater use of automation in manufacturing production that might limit the positive spillovers from the export recovery to employment and household income, (2) excess capacity in some business sectors following significant capacity upgrades in earlier periods, together with businesses’ limited ability to adapt to the changing economic environment, and (3) lower competitiveness of SMEs compared with large firms that in part reduced debt serviceability to some extent.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that these structural challenges could not be addressed by monetary policy or demand-side policies alone but required structural reforms as well.",
        "At the same time, some Committee members saw the need to develop economic indicators to assess economic conditions at the micro level, especially with regard to labor and household income.",
        "These indicators would be beneficial to policy makers, as they would allow for a deeper understanding of behavior and welfare of citizens in various parts of the economy and would aid in assessing the ongoing recovery in a manner that would be comprehensive and reflective of the structural changes in the economy, with implications for the conduct of monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion on the BOT’s preliminary study on Thailand’s long-term potential growth.",
        "The assessment in the study was based on the projected trend growth of factors of production such as hours worked, labor quality, capital, and total factor productivity (production function framework) that incorporated several structural changes in the economy such as population aging, adoption of productivityenhancing technology, and large-scale infrastructure investment.",
        "According to some Committee members, Thailand’s potential growth would likely decline due to a wide range of factors such as (1) a declining labor force due to population aging, (2) skill mismatches in the labor market that could lead to underutilized capacity, and (3) slower productivity growth due to investment shifts toward the service sector that required less capital investment and had lower sectoral productivity.",
        "Going forward, however, should the government be able to successfully carry out large-scale infrastructure investment and promote new industries under the S-curve project as planned, Thailand’s potential growth could increase.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members viewed that the assessment of Thailand’s potential growth must also account for factors such as (1) the increasing use of automation in manufacturing, (2) investment in intangible assets such as human resource development and intellectual property, and (3) the use of immigrant labor in place of the aging workforce.",
        "Taking the above factors into account would allow a more comprehensive analysis that yielded meaningful implications for the conduct of monetary policy to close the output gap within an appropriate time horizon, and for structural reform policies to uplift potential growth in the long term.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound as reflected in the financial health of commercial banks and businesses, especially listed companies, and the slowdown in debt accumulation by both households and businesses.",
        "However, there remained pockets of risks that still warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in the quality of loans extended to households and businesses, especially low-income households and SMEs.",
        "Meanwhile, risks of system-wide asset price bubbles remained limited given that asset prices stabilized in both securities and housing markets.",
        "At the same time, risks pertaining to the rollover of unrated bonds eased somewhat as financing costs for new bond issuances did not significantly increase, although the rollover of unrated bonds maturing in the near term continued to warrant monitoring.",
        "The search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment remained present.",
        "Foreign investment funds (FIFs), especially those that invest in short-term deposits, continued to grow.",
        "However, risks remained contained as most funds invested in countries with investment grade credit rating.",
        "In addition, saving cooperatives’ asset size continued to increase.",
        "Some saving cooperatives with deposits and borrowings in excess of members’ loan demand might seek higher yields by investing more in risky assets.",
        "Some saving cooperatives with insufficient financing from members might rely on short-term borrowing or resort to attracting deposits through higher interest rates to finance their lending operations.",
        "In both cases, mismanagement of their operations might affect confidence of cooperatives’ members, and thus the Committee saw the need for a close monitoring.",
        "Some Committee members also saw the need for a close cooperation between various regulatory agencies to close any regulatory gap and to detect potential risks in order to address those risks in an appropriate and timely manner.",
        "The Committee discussed and exchanged views on important issues that had implications for the policy decision as follows.",
        "(1) While Thailand’s growth outlook improved further mainly on account of exports, growth was still limited to some parts of the economy and was subjected to greater risks on the external front.",
        "Some Committee members expressed concerns with regard to the contraction in private investment and noted that export-related businesses that enjoyed growth in the recent period still possessed a fair amount of excess capacity which might delay new investment.",
        "As such, maintaining interest rates at low levels remained necessary to support growth.",
        "Other Committee members added that improvements in the growth outlook would initially benefit larger businesses more than smaller firms partly due to SMEs’ limited capacity to adapt.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was softer than expected due mainly to supply-sided factors but retained an upward trajectory in the latter half of the year.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that further monetary policy accommodation at this time might have limited consequences for inflation.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that a continued decline in the public’s medium-inflation expectations and deflationary risks were unlikely to materialize as private spending continued to show improvements.",
        "In addition, some members viewed that inflation would mainly be driven by developments in global oil prices.",
        "As global oil prices were expected to stabilize or edge up somewhat, there would not be downward inflationary pressures as in earlier periods.",
        "However, headline inflation might experience further fluctuations depending on fresh food prices.",
        "One Committee member noted that medium term inflation expectations declined somewhat despite remaining close to the midpoint of the target, and thus warranted close monitoring going forward.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound but there were pockets of risks that continued to warrant monitoring, namely the deterioration in debt serviceability of SMEs and the search- for-yield behavior.",
        "Some Committee members concurred that NPLs in some sectors might not decrease as the economy continued to expand due to structural challenges such as businesses’ inability to adapt.",
        "Some members were also concerned about the ongoing search for yield in the low interest rate environment as well as other potential financial imbalances that remained undetected.",
        "In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that Thailand’s growth outlook further improved, while headline inflation softened on account of supply-side factors but retained an upward trajectory in the latter half of the year.",
        "Nonetheless, growth was still limited to some parts of the economy and faced with risks on the external front.",
        "The policy rate should thus remain low at its current level in support of continued and more broad-based growth.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members regarded the preservation of policy space as important given domestic and external uncertainties.",
        "In this light, the Committee unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting in order to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support the continuation of economic growth, while preserving financial stability.",
        "The growth outlook for Thailand’s trading partner economies improved due to stronger growth momentum in some countries.",
        "The US economy continued to expand on the back of domestic demand, while anticipated stimulus measures under the new administration and improved private-sector confidence would contribute positively to business investment in the period ahead.",
        "Given the expected acceleration in inflation, market participants anticipated that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would continue to pursue monetary policy normalization this year.",
        "Asian economies gained additional growth momentum from a stronger recovery in exports, especially those of electronic goods which benefited from the global recovery and the technological upcycle that might last longer than expected.",
        "The Committee assessed that risks to global growth were largely unchanged from the previous meeting, according to which the recovery remained fragile with a large degree of uncertainty, particularly with respect to shifts in the investment and trade policies as well as the stance on foreign trade agreements by the new US administration.",
        "In addition, potential trade retaliations from US key trading partners would have adverse implications for global trade going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, risks pertaining to China’s real estate and financial sectors, political developments in Europe, and problems faced by the European banking sector remained.",
        "The Committee would therefore continue to monitor these risks closely, particularly the US economic and foreign trade policies which could have both positive and negative impacts on Thailand.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets increased following the announcement of the US presidential election outcome.",
        "With investors reducing their holding of emerging market assets, including those of Thailand, Thai government bond yields were on the rise.",
        "However, the global financial markets underwent corrections since the end of 2016 as investors revised their expectations of the US economic policies, leading to a depreciation of the US dollar.",
        "While the baht appreciated against the US dollar in line with movements of regional currencies, the extent of the appreciation was more than those of trading partner currencies, partly due to investors’ confidence in Thailand’s external stability.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) thus appreciated somewhat since the last meeting.",
        "The Committee anticipated that capital flows and exchange rates would continue to be highly volatile as external uncertainties remained considerable, depending on the actual implementation of US fiscal stimulus as well as the pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to expand at a faster pace on the back of a more broad- based recovery in merchandise exports, which were expected to receive continued support from the demand for electronic goods and relocation of production sites for some products to Thailand.",
        "At the same time, tourism recovered faster than expected.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important growth driver and was expected to gain further traction from infrastructure investment in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption and private investment continued to recover at a gradual pace.",
        "Nevertheless, growth in private investment was still concentrated in certain business sectors, namely alternative energy, telecommunication, and manufacturing of electronic goods.",
        "This was in line with the pickup in exports, and consistent with the extension of business credit by commercial banks that were concentrated in these particular sectors.",
        "In this light, the Committee would continue to monitor signs of positive spillovers from the recovery in exports to employment and private investment in order to ensure a sustained and broad-based economic recovery.",
        "Headline inflation continued trending upward and returned to the target band in December last year.",
        "Core inflation steadied around the previous assessment which reflected low demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the target.",
        "The Committee assessed that the recovery of the Thai economy was still subject to risks that warranted close monitoring.",
        "These included, in particular, the outturn of the US economic and foreign trade policies that would have implications for confidence and international trade.",
        "In addition, risks pertaining to political developments in Europe and problems faced by European banks could affect investors’ confidence and contribute to financial market volatilities in the future, which might subsequently impact the recovery of Thailand as well as other regional economies.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts.",
        "However, there were pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in the quality of loans extended to businesses, especially small-and-medium-sized enterprises companies.",
        "In addition, the search-for-yield behavior would be closely monitored as it might lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "The Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, Thailand’s growth outlook improved compared with the previous assessment, but the recovery still faced external risks that warranted close monitoring.",
        "Inflation returned to the target band and continued trending upward.",
        "In addition, overall financing conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery, with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates despite increases in bond yields due to domestic and external factors.",
        "With regard to the exchange rate movements over the recent period, uncertainties stemming from external developments led to some appreciation of the baht against major trading partners’ currencies which, in the Committee’s view, might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "While the Thai economy started to gain more traction, uncertainties remained considerable, particularly those pertaining to the fragile global economic recovery and the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies especially the US, which might significantly impact the recovery of trading partner economies and consequently Thai exports.",
        "Meanwhile, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor and assess the sustainability of the ongoing recovery as well as potential risks going forward.",
        "In addition, some Committee members viewed that risk management on the part of the private sector would become increasingly important in an environment of highly volatile capital flows and exchange rates.",
        "Going forward, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative and would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability",
        "The growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partner economies improved slightly from the previous meeting underpinned by continued growth momentum.",
        "The US economy was expected to gain further traction on the back of private consumption that was supported by labor market conditions, which was approaching full employment, and strong household financial positions.",
        "The euro area economy continued to recover driven by domestic demand that benefited from accommodative financing conditions, rising employment, reduced political uncertainties after the results of the French presidential election, and improved exports growth.",
        "The Japanese economy recovered at a gradual pace mainly on account of exports, while domestic consumption was supported by accommodative monetary policy and improved labor market conditions.",
        "Asian economies continued to recover, driven by exports to G3 economies and growth in exports of technological products especially electronics.",
        "Nevertheless, Asian exports to China were expected to soften somewhat, as the Chinese economy slowed down due to ongoing economic structural reforms that placed greater emphasis on long-term stability.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to slowly rise in most trading partners’ economies due to several factors such as the decline in global oil prices and domestic demand recovery that was not sufficiently strong.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation remained broadly stable.",
        "Looking ahead, inflation expectations decreased slightly in G3 economies but remained largely unchanged in most Asian economies.",
        "In addition, most central banks kept the policy interest rates unchanged over the intermeeting period except for the Federal Reserve (Fed) which raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.00–1.25 percent at the meeting on 13-14 June 2017.",
        "Most analysts expected the Fed to start its balance sheet normalization earlier than previously expected and to raise the federal funds rate once more over the remainder of this year.",
        "The Committee assessed that the balance of risks to the global economic recovery remained skewed to the downside especially due to risks associated with US economic and foreign trade policies, China’s economic structural reforms, and geopolitical risks.",
        "However, the degree of uncertainties declined overall.",
        "Particularly, upside risks decreased as the swift implementation of US economic stimulus policies became less likely.",
        "Downside risks also decreased, as concerns over the possible breakup of the European Union (EU) subsided after pro-EU political parties claimed victory in the French and Italian elections.",
        "The Committee noted the following points.",
        "First, despite overall improvements in economic growth and labor market conditions, the softer inflation outlook for the G3 economies was partly attributable to country-specific factors.",
        "For the US, these included (1) cheaper mobile phone plans whose impact was estimated to be transitory and (2) wage negotiations that were based on backward-looking price increases.",
        "Meanwhile, hiring in the EU was still geared toward temporary workers rather than full-time employees.",
        "However, if economic growth were to accelerate going forward, inflationary pressures might ratchet up and central banks in G3 economies might have to raise their policy rates earlier than previously expected.",
        "Second, private investment remained low in many countries partly due to high corporate debt levels and political uncertainties, both of which were considered risks that could affect the ongoing global economic recovery.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets improved as investors’ concerns over the US political situation eased.",
        "At the same time, the market expected monetary policy normalization in G3 economies to proceed at a gradual pace given (1) low inflationary pressures, (2) the outline of the Fed’s balance sheet normalization plan which turned out as expected, and (3) the lack of clarity in the implementation of US economic stimulus policies.",
        "Consequently, improvements in investors’ sentiments led to larger-than-expected increases in asset prices in global financial markets and capital inflows to regional countries, especially into bond markets.",
        "Nevertheless, recent portfolio inflows to Thailand were smaller in size compared with inflows to other countries in the region.",
        "In addition, demand for longterm Thai government bonds from both foreign and domestic investors, coupled with the slowdown in inflation, resulted in a somewhat significant decline in long-term government bond yields from levels seen at the previous meeting.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term Thai government bond yields declined somewhat due to the reduction in short-term bond issuances by both the BOT and the Ministry of Finance.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index was largely unchanged relative to regional equity indices that went up with prices of technology stocks, which constituted only a small share in the SET Index.",
        "With regard to the exchange rates, the baht appreciated against the US dollar to a greater extent than other regional currencies in some periods due to steady US dollar sales by Thai exporters.",
        "As a result, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) appreciated from the last meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, Thailand’s relatively low inflation compared with overall trading partners helped the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) to appreciate less than the NEER.",
        "The costs of financing and borrowing from commercial banks remained unchanged after the benchmark retail interest rates were cut in earlier periods.",
        "Going forward, the Committee anticipated capital inflows to regional financial markets including Thailand, given the gradual pace of monetary policy adjustment in G3 economies, combined with the attractiveness of Thai assets to foreign investors that were attributed to Thailand’s strong external position.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to monitor shortterm capital flows and encourage the private sector to continue giving due consideration to exchange rate risk management in light of capital flow and exchange rate volatilities.",
        "Thailand’s economic growth continued to gain further traction.",
        "Growth was driven primarily by a more broad-based expansion in merchandise exports across various export destinations and product categories, particularly electronics which accelerated thanks to the increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) products as well as the relocation of production sites from Japan to Thailand.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism showed better-than-expected growth mainly on account of the number of Chinese tourists.",
        "Private consumption expanded at a gradual pace following more broad-based recovery in farm income across different regions in Thailand.",
        "Nevertheless, overall purchasing power had yet to fully recover, as wages in the manufacturing sectors did not benefit much from the export recovery.",
        "This was partly because increases in working hours were so far limited to certain industries, namely food, electronics, and metal fabrication, while the average earnings in most manufacturing sectors had yet to increase.",
        "In addition, some Committee members noted that recent increases in private consumption through e-commerce might not fully be captured by current consumption indicators.",
        "This must be monitored more closely, as e-commerce would have important implications for consumer behavior and data compilation going forward.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important economic driver despite unexpected delays in some public investment projects due partly to delays in budget disbursement and difficulties in acquiring additional budget appropriations.",
        "Meanwhile, private investment recovered at a gradual pace and was still concentrated mainly among export-related businesses with good performances.",
        "The Committee assessed that Thailand’s growth outlook for 2017 improved further and that the economy would expand at a faster pace than previously projected.",
        "The growth forecast for 2017 was revised up from 3.4 percent to 3.5 percent.",
        "This upward revision was due to the better-than-expected outturn in the first quarter, as well as better-than-expected improvements in merchandise and service exports, which partly offset the impact of delays in public investment.",
        "Private consumption would gradually expand, while private investment was expected to grow at a more moderate pace than previously estimated.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, the Thai economy would continue to expand and achieve a 3.7 percent growth in 2018, driven by both public investment and private spending.",
        "Meanwhile, exports were expected to grow but would soften somewhat due partly to (1) the slowdown in China’s production of electronics, following prior acceleration, which might affect exports of Thailand that was part of the supply chain, (2) slowing rubber exports to China as the country pared down its elevated rubber stock and as rubber prices started to decline, and (3) structural difficulties faced by exporters in some industries, in particular automotive given production capacity expansion currently underway in regional countries.",
        "On the whole, Thailand’s growth would continue to improve further with lower forecast uncertainties.",
        "Notwithstanding, the balance of risks to the growth projection remained tilted to the downside similar to the previous assessment due to external factors.",
        "These external factors included in particular uncertainties in US foreign trade policies, China’s economic structural reforms, and geopolitical risks that could have adverse economic impacts on Thailand’s trading partners.",
        "At the same time, the recovery in domestic purchasing power was not yet broad-based.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion on the expected continuity of export growth.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that exports would continue with favorable growth given the expansion seen in maritime shipping volumes and the improved global economic outlook.",
        "Meanwhile, many industries had planned to increase their business investment in Thailand, which would also support export growth in the period ahead.",
        "Nevertheless, some Committee members viewed that there remained risks associated with declines in the global oil prices, which could affect exports of petroleum and petro-chemical products, together with risks stemming from uncertainties in US trade policies that continued to warrant close monitoring going forward.",
        "Headline inflation was softer than expected in May and June 2017 due mainly to supply-side factors.",
        "In particular, fresh food prices declined on account of higher agricultural output thanks to favorable weather conditions coupled with the high base following last year’s drought.",
        "Meanwhile, global oil prices also declined.",
        "As a result, headline inflation might fall below the lower bound of the target in some periods.",
        "Core inflation remained stable at low levels in line with subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "In the near term, it was expected that demand pressures would pass through only slightly to core inflation, as positive spillovers from export expansion to domestic demand were limited so far.",
        "Moreover, the relationship between economic growth and inflation was weaker than in the past due to structural shifts and external influences on domestic inflation.",
        "This finding was in line with studies undertaken in the context of Thailand and other countries.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "Given the softer-than-expected inflation outturn in the first five months of this year and a more subdued outlook for fresh food and oil prices compared with the previous assessment, the Committee revised down the headline inflation forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 0.8 and down to 0.6 and 0.9 percent, respectively.",
        "Looking ahead, despite the forecast revision headline inflation was expected to slowly rise over the latter half of 2017 and throughout the following year as downward pressures from supply-side factors subsided.",
        "These included the base effects of higher fresh food prices that would dissipate gradually, the expected rise in global oil prices in tandem with the global economic recovery, an increase in electricity costs in Thailand in the second half of this year, and rising core inflation especially if domestic demand exhibited a clear and sustained recovery.",
        "Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation forecast tilted to the upside as more stringent regulations on immigrant workers might tighten labor market conditions and in turn increase labor costs for businesses.",
        "The extent of such impacts would also depend on the implementation and management of the new regulations by the government.",
        "In addition, some Committee members noted that the impacts would be more pronounced in certain sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and services.",
        "Notwithstanding, some Committee members viewed that there would be more downward inflationary pressures from structural factors, including advancements in shale-oil production technology and the role of e-commerce that might contribute to sluggish inflation than expected.",
        "The expansion of commercial bank loans remained low overall.",
        "Loans to large corporates started to expand across business sectors, while loans to small-and-medium sized enterprises estate and hotels.",
        "Business financing through the bond markets continued to increase.",
        "Consumer loan growth turned positive in almost all loan purposes except credit card loans.",
        "Meanwhile, the number of loan applications and loan approval rates increased overall.",
        "Corporate loan utilization rates rose slightly especially for loans extended to large businesses.",
        "Credit quality deteriorated as reflected in rising non-performing loans (NPLs) in almost all loan categories, especially SMEs in many industries whose businesses were affected by several factors, such as declining competitiveness, limited recovery in consumers’ purchasing power, and falling commodity prices.",
        "In any case, financial institutions maintained high levels of loan loss provision and capital buffers which provided cushion against deterioration in credit quality.",
        "The Committee noted that, despite overall improvements in economic growth, the continued deterioration in credit quality especially for SMEs might partly stem from SMEs’ inability to compete with larger businesses.",
        "Thus, the Committee saw a need to closely monitor developments of, and factors attributing to, NPLs at sectoral levels, as well as to develop economic indicators that would better reflect NPL trends.",
        "In addition, a few Committee members viewed that current situations on immigrant workers might affect SMEs and their debt serviceability.",
        "Furthermore, some Committee members noted that debt restructuring for SMEs might have been given a lower priority compared with larger businesses which caused the slow decline in NPLs among SMEs.",
        "The Committee assessed that Thailand’s growth outlook improved further particularly on the back of external factors, while domestic demand expanded at a gradual pace and was not yet sufficiently broad-based.",
        "Headline inflation softened and might fall below the lower bound of the target in some periods due mainly to supply-side factors.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation was projected to slowly rise in the latter half of this year.",
        "Meanwhile, there remained financial stability risks under the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee discussed the need for accommodative monetary policy taking into consideration costs and risks as summarized below.",
        "(1) Thailand’s growth outlook improved further driven mainly by merchandise exports, but domestic demand growth was not yet sufficiently broad-based.",
        "Most Committee members were concerned that SMEs did not gain much from the economic recovery partly due to their lack of competitiveness, thus potentially limiting distribution of income going forward.",
        "Several Committee members also added that current situations on immigrant workers might pose additional challenges for SMEs.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members expressed concerns on the continuity of export growth, as Thai exports might gain only limited benefits from the global economic recovery going forward, given that structural problems in manufacturing sectors that could affect their competitiveness remained largely unsolved.",
        "In addition, some Committee members viewed that an accommodative monetary policy stance was still warranted given low private investment and employment growth.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members viewed that Thailand’s economic growth remained at risk if public investment did not proceed as planned.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was softer than expected due mainly to supply-side factors but retained an upward trajectory in the latter half of this year.",
        "The Committee viewed that the decline in inflation, in which headline inflation might fall below the lower bound of target in some periods, was due to supply-side factors.",
        "However, the Committee expected inflation to gradually rise during the second half of this year and reach the lower bound of the target towards the end of this year or the early part of next year once the effects of the temporary supply-side factors dissipated, and demand inflationary pressure increased in line with projected economic expansion.",
        "Hence, further monetary policy accommodation in response to low inflation in this context deemed unnecessary.",
        "Nevertheless, there remained uncertainties in the inflation outlook and the period in which inflation would return to the target, and thus inflation developments must be monitored closely.",
        "Under the Committee’s view, the current accommodative monetary policy stance would still be needed and would play a crucial role in supporting domestic demand and sustaining inflationary pressures going forward.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that continued to warrant monitoring.",
        "Most Committee members expressed concerns over debt serviceability of SMEs and the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "The latter was partly reflected in increased investment in riskier assets relative to bank deposits, such as foreign investment fund (FIFs), deposits at saving cooperatives, and unrated bonds.",
        "These risk-taking behavior could lead to underpricing of risks and also to other financial imbalances that remained undetected.",
        "In this light, the Committee unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting and concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance to support the continuation of economic growth, while preserving financial",
        "The growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners improved slightly from the previous meeting with stronger growth momentum.",
        "The US economy was projected to continue expanding driven by improvements in private consumption and investment despite some decline in private sector confidence as a result of political risks.",
        "The euro area economy recorded a stronger expansion thanks to higher production and domestic spending, with growth beginning to broaden to periphery countries.",
        "Japan continued to grow at a gradual pace on the back of exports and domestic consumption, while indicators of capital expenditure showed signs of improvement.",
        "Asian economies continued to recover thanks to exports, with signs of positive spillovers to investment and employment seen in some countries.",
        "Nevertheless, private consumption was still slowly recovering and held back by elevated household debt in some countries.",
        "Looking ahead, Asian exports were expected to moderate somewhat in line with the slowdown in the Chinese economy due to ongoing economic structural reforms.",
        "Although the growth outlook of most trading partners improved, inflation was rising only slowly and was still below target in most economies.",
        "Hence, most central banks kept the policy interest rates unchanged over the inter-meeting period.",
        "While the Federal Reserve remained on the path of monetary policy normalization, concerns regarding low inflation led market participants to anticipate a more gradual hike in the federal funds rate.",
        "In addition, some central banks employed additional tools to maintain economic and financial stability, such as macroprudential measures to address risks in the real estate sector, and the accumulation of foreign reserves as a buffer against future shocks, especially if advanced economies were to increase policy rates faster than expected.",
        "The Committee assessed risks to global economic recovery to have declined on both the upside and the downside.",
        "In particular, upside risks decreased as the swift implementation of US economic stimulus policies became less likely.",
        "Downside risks also declined, given the assessment that Chinese authorities would be able to manage risks to economic and financial stability that might arise from ongoing economic structural reforms.",
        "Meanwhile, downside risks associated with uncertainties surrounding US economic and foreign trade policies and global geopolitical risks was largely unchanged, and thus the balance of risks to global growth remained skewed downward.",
        "Some Committee members also noted that, even if the Chinese authorities could effectively manage economic and financial stability risks, there remained uncertainty about a slowdown in economic activities in the short run.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets picked up on the back of the improved growth outlook in many countries, especially in the euro area, although there were periods of heightened concerns due to rising tensions in the Korean peninsula.",
        "At the same time, investor sentiments towards the US dollar were negatively affected by rising US political risks, lower probability that economic stimulus policies in the US would proceed as the market expected, and weaker-than-expected economic data.",
        "Combined with accommodative global financial conditions, such developments resulted in continued capital inflows to regional bond markets.",
        "Consequently, the baht appreciated against the US dollar from the previous meeting.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) also strengthened despite relatively smaller capital inflows to Thailand compared with other countries in the region because, in the latter half of July, Thai corporates and foreign affiliates obtained a large amount of financing abroad, and Thailand’s current account recorded a larger surplus than what the market expected.",
        "Nevertheless, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciated less relative to the NEER, given that Thailand’ s inflation was lower compared with trading partners.",
        "The Committee viewed that the stronger appreciation of the baht relative to those of regional currencies in some periods might affect business adjustments and thus would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market going forward.",
        "With regard to the bond market, short-term government bond yields decreased and fell below the policy rate in some periods.",
        "This was mainly a result of the reduction in issuances of short- term BOT bonds and treasury bills.",
        "The Committee noted that the decline in short- term yields had no bearing on the future monetary policy stance which would be primarily conditioned on the outlook of inflation, economic growth, and financial stability.",
        "The Committee also expected that short-term yields would not decline further, given that some investors already made portfolio adjustments and that the government would resume issuing treasury bills at the beginning of the next fiscal year.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to continue expanding driven mainly by merchandise exports and tourism.",
        "Merchandise exports recorded stronger growth across various export destinations and product categories, consistent with faster economic growth among Thailand’s trading partners.",
        "Such improvements in the export outlook were observed for exporting firms of all sizes, both large corporates and small-and-medium sized enterprises tourists from China and ASEAN countries.",
        "Nevertheless, growth in domestic demand lagged behind external demand.",
        "Private consumption was projected to expand at a gradual pace, supported in part by improvements in farm income that resulted from higher agricultural output during periods of favorable weather conditions.",
        "However, elevated household debt still weighed on private consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, overall labor income had yet to increase, despite improvements in employment and hours worked in overtime seen particularly among export-related businesses.",
        "Under the Committee’s view, private consumption and consumer confidence had not yet shown a strong recovery overall.",
        "Private investment was expected to slowly recover.",
        "Higher level of investment in machinery and equipment was observed among export-oriented businesses with good growth performances, with some capital outlays spent on the adoption of automation systems to enhance production efficiency.",
        "Construction outlays, however, declined in tandem with the slowdown in the real estate sector.",
        "Public expenditure slowed somewhat due to delays in the disbursement of the additional budget for the fiscal year 2017 as well as revisions to the investment plans of some state-own enterprise projects.",
        "Going forward, the Committee would continue to monitor certain issues and their impacts on the overall growth outlook.",
        "First, preliminary assessments of the flood in the northeastern region of Thailand indicated that its impact on industrial and commercial areas was limited in scope and size.",
        "Regarding the impact on agricultural output and farm households, the Committee assessed that the flood would cause a loss of approximately 7.5 billion baht.",
        "Despite a limited impact on the overall economy, the consequence on the wellbeing of citizens in the affected areas were quite significant.",
        "Second, the more stringent regulations on immigrant workers might affect business sectors employing a high proportion of immigrant labor, in particular smaller firms in construction, agricultural, and agro-manufacturing sectors that faced greater difficulties in making business adjustments compared with larger firms.",
        "On the whole, the net impact of the regulations would depend on how employers would adapt, labor substitutability among remaining workers, and labor productivity in each manufacturing sector.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, there would be some immigrant workers permanently exiting the labor market, and thus a clear policy direction on how the government would manage the situation going forward would be critical.",
        "Third, the Committee would monitor the ability to adapt and conform of both consumers and financial institutions to the recent regulations on credit cards and personal loans under supervision.",
        "The overall impacts of these new rules on private consumption were expected to be limited, given that the measures would apply only to new loans and that these measures had taken into consideration consumer behavior regarding the use of credit cards and personal loans.",
        "The Committee also engaged in an extensive discussion on the economic outlook.",
        "In particular, tourism growth might slow down from supply-side factors such as the limited airport capacity to accommodate the significant increases in flights and passenger arrivals.",
        "The expansion of airport capacity could therefore be consequential, along with an emphasis on policies aimed at improving tourism quality in attracting high-income tourists rather than those aimed at increasing tourist numbers.",
        "Nevertheless, such policies would require some time to be implemented.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to rise but at a slightly slower pace than previously assessed mainly because of supply-side factors.",
        "In particular, fresh food prices declined given the abundant supply of vegetables and fruits thanks to favorable weather conditions; low inflation was also due to last year’s high base following the drought.",
        "Meanwhile, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low.",
        "In addition, the government decided to continue subsidizing prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) using the State Oil Fund for some periods, even after the launch of the LPG price liberalization on 1[st] August 2017.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation was projected to gradually rise in the latter half of the year as downward supply pressures dissipated and as domestic demand recovered.",
        "In addition, there were upside risks to inflation including excise tax increases and higher labor costs that might result from tighter labor market conditions following the recent regulations on immigrant workers.",
        "Nonetheless, downside risks remained given that economic growth might be lower than expected if domestic demand did not exhibit a strong recovery.",
        "Core inflation increased slightly from the previous month and was expected to slowly rise in tandem with the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "Looking ahead, some Committee members noted that headline inflation in the latter half of this year might be softer than expected given that agricultural output, especially rice, would likely be high.",
        "Growth in commercial bank loans increased mainly on the back of business loans, in particular loans extended to real estate and export-related sectors.",
        "In terms of size, credit expansion was observed for both large corporates and SMEs, with a relatively stronger growth for the former.",
        "Nevertheless, such expansion of business credits did not fully reflect new investment, as new credits were mostly for working capital and financial restructuring purposes, consistent with the slow recovery in private investment.",
        "Consumer loans remained largely stable with a resumption in auto loans being observed.",
        "In addition, the approval rate for business loans increased in tandem with higher loan demand especially among those with larger credit lines.",
        "Meanwhile, commercial banks remained cautious in extending loans to households.",
        "Credit quality deteriorated due to loan defaults by some large corporates, but the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio was largely unchanged as banks also wrote off debts from their balance sheet during this period.",
        "Notably, the NPLs for medium-sized businesses started to decline; however, NPLs for smaller businesses in the commercial sector continued to rise.",
        "In any case, financial institutions maintained high levels of loan loss provision and capital buffers, which provided cushion against deterioration in credit quality.",
        "The Committee saw the need to closely monitor NPLs of loans extended to small enterprises.",
        "Some members were of the view that the decline in NPLs of SME loans in export-related sectors could be partly attributed to export growth seen in firms of various sizes.",
        "Financial stability remained sound but there were pockets of risks that continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "The ratio of household and corporate debt to GDP was projected to decline, consistent with the gradual recovery in private consumption and private investment.",
        "Nevertheless, there were risks associated with debt serviceability of firms, particularly SMEs, and households.",
        "In the real estate sector, risks from the oversupply of condominiums in Bangkok and vicinities remained stable, but the situation in certain areas with elevated unsold condominium inventory and longer time estimated to deplete inventory must still be monitored as well as developments of large mixed-use projects that were launched recently, and their implication for oversupply in the property market especially from 2020 onward when these projects were expected to be completed and open for sale.",
        "Meanwhile, risks pertaining to the rollover of unrated bonds eased somewhat, although debt serviceability and the ability to roll over maturing debt of risky issuers continued to warrant monitoring in the period ahead.",
        "Furthermore, some Committee members viewed that the market started to adapt as reflected in increased financing costs for riskier businesses, and the fact that mutual funds exercised greater caution when investing in unrated bonds.",
        "In the period ahead, it would be essential to have a closer cooperation between various regulatory agencies to develop mechanisms that would enforce market discipline among bond issuers in order to facilitate better risk assessments on the part of the stakeholders.",
        "In addition, the Committee noted that, while the ratio of household debt to GDP continued to decline, private consumption was still expanding only slowly despite the fact that the Thai economy as a whole continued to expand.",
        "This could be partly because household income growth lagged behind GDP growth.",
        "As a result, household debt relative to income might not yet decline.",
        "The search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate remained present as reflected in (1) the continued expansion in foreign investment funds (FIFs), although risks were limited as most funds invested in countries with investment grade credit rating, and (2) the increase in the asset size of saving cooperatives following expansion in deposits.",
        "Furthermore, some saving cooperatives accepted deposits from associate members in addition to regular members.",
        "This might prompt saving cooperatives, especially those with available funds exceeding member’s loan demand, to seek higher yields by investing in riskier assets.",
        "The Committee assessed Thailand’s growth outlook to have gained further traction mainly on account of external demand.",
        "Meanwhile, the expansion of domestic demand was not yet sufficiently strong, although positive spillovers from export growth were observed in other parts of the economy.",
        "While headline inflation softened and might fall below the lower bound of the target in some periods mainly because of supply-side factors, it was projected to slowly rise in the latter half of this year.",
        "Core inflation remained low.",
        "Consequently, the Committee viewed that the current level of monetary policy accommodation was still needed to support domestic demand growth in order to close the output gap and to facilitate a gradual return of headline inflation to target in the period ahead.",
        "In addition, the Committee viewed that the effect of a policy rate cut to foster a swifter return of inflation to target would be limited.",
        "This was because the decline in inflation was attributed mainly to supply-side factors and might partly be a result of structural factors.",
        "At the same time, a policy rate cut at the current juncture might exacerbate financial stability risks given the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follow.",
        "(1) Thailand’s growth outlook was expected to gain further traction mainly on account of merchandise exports and tourism, while domestic demand expanded at a gradual pace.",
        "Benefits from the export expansion were limited to some business sectors and still did not lend support to income and employment in the broader economy.",
        "Hence, private consumption and investment growth was not sufficiently strong.",
        "The Committee also viewed that the ongoing economic expansion had not yet broaden to domestic-oriented SMEs and low-income households.",
        "Moreover, some Committee members expressed concerns on shortterm adjustments by businesses from the impact of more stringent regulations on immigrant workers.",
        "Overall, the Committee viewed that an accommodative monetary policy stance was still needed at the current juncture to support a more robust economic expansion.",
        "(2) Headline inflation softened due mainly to supply-side factors but retained an upward trajectory in the latter half of this year.",
        "The Committee was concerned with sluggish headline inflation but anticipated that it would gradually rise.",
        "In this regard, maintaining the current level of monetary policy accommodation would be conducive to returning inflation to target over the medium term, although this process might take some time.",
        "Meanwhile, a few Committee members added that deflation risks remained low given that the economy still continued to expand, prices of most goods and services either picked up or remained stable, and medium-term expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that continued to warrant monitoring.",
        "Most Committee members expressed concerns regarding the rising NPLs especially among small businesses which partly reflected their limited ability to adapt to competition and structural changes.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members were concerned that the declining household debt-to-GDP ratio might not reflect deleveraging given that private consumption did not improved significantly in the recent periods.",
        "Most Committee members were also concerned with the search-for-yield behavior which became more prominent in the environment where the policy rate remained low for an extended period.",
        "This was partly reflected in increased investment in riskier assets relative to commercial bank deposits, including investment in foreign investment fund (FIFs), deposits at saving cooperatives, and unrated bonds, which could coincide with underpricing of risks.",
        "Moreover, there remained the need to monitor trend of short-term financing by businesses, especially those in sectors with long term investment projects which could result in possible maturity mismatch.",
        "Increased competition in lending to larger firms, both among banks and between bank and the bond market, must also be monitored as it might lead to excessively low financing costs for large firms and potential underpricing of risks.",
        "In addition, there could be other financial stability problems that remained undetected, especially those stemming from regulatory gaps.",
        "It would therefore be essential that financial regulatory authorities coordinate more closely to ensure that macroprudential measures could be implemented in an appropriate and timely manner.",
        "In this light, the Committee unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting and concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving financial",
        "The global economy overall continued to recover while inflation still remained low.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies continued expanding and largely unchanged from the previous projection, driven mainly by growth in advanced economies as well as rising corporate profits both in advanced economies and Asia.",
        "Advanced economies expanded on the back of improvements in consumer confidence and production.",
        "China expanded at a slightly faster pace than previously assessed but was projected to moderate due to ongoing economic structural reforms toward a domestic consumption-oriented economy, a slowdown in public infrastructure investment, and impacts of government measures on private investment in the property sector.",
        "Asian economies recorded slightly stronger growth than the previous assessment owing mainly to exports and production on the back of a recovery in advanced economies.",
        "Recent global events—such as the new Politburo Standing Committee in China, Japan’s general election, the ECB’s reduction in asset purchases, and the appointment of the new Fed chairman—would not significantly affect direction of economic and monetary policies of these countries.",
        "With regard to monetary policy, most central banks maintained their accommodative stance to support economic growth or foster a return of inflation to target.",
        "However, some central banks in advanced economies gradually raised policy rates given stronger economic growth and labor markets along with clearer signs of inflation rising toward the target.",
        "The Committee noted that risks to global economic recovery became more balanced relative to the downward bias in the previous assessment.",
        "In particular, upside risks increased thanks to the higher probability of US tax stimulus policies, a faster pace of Chinese economic growth over the medium term, and clearer signs of a recovery of domestic demand in Asian economies, while geopolitical risks still warranted monitoring.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets remained sound on the back of the positive global economic outlook and gradual interest rate hikes of major advanced economies, although volatility heightened in some periods along with uncertainties from the appointment of the new Fed chairman and the progress in US tax reform.",
        "Capital inflows to emerging market economies slowed down in line with lower non-resident investment in Thailand’s financial markets in both equities and short-term bonds, while non-resident investment in long-term bonds remained stable.",
        "With regard to exchange rates, the baht remained stable against the US dollar and was in line with regional currencies.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciated somewhat due to the weakening of some major currencies.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term government bond yields remained below the policy rate as a result of reduced issuances of short-term BOT bonds and treasury bills.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index edged up in line with regional stock indices.",
        "This was partly driven by purchases by domestic institutional investors as concerns on political uncertainties had declined.",
        "In the period ahead, capital inflows to emerging market economies would continue to increase given improved economic growth.",
        "In addition, the baht against the US dollar might experience increased volatilities from external factors, especially uncertainties pertaining to the tax reform and stimulus economic policies in the US and monetary policy in advanced countries.",
        "Thus, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to gain further traction from the previous assessment driven by merchandise exports and improved private consumption.",
        "Merchandise exports expanded well and was projected to continue growth momentum on the back of stronger recovery in the global economy.",
        "This was in line with the global trade growth this year and the next that was projected to exceed the previous assessment.",
        "Private investment particularly in machinery and equipment continued to improve, as reflected in signs of increasing imported capital goods and domestic machinery sales across various industries.",
        "Nevertheless, private investment in the period ahead was projected to expand gradually due to overcapacity in some industries as well as delayed disbursement for some public investment projects.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism growth was in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Private consumption continued to pick up as purchasing power and consumer confidence improved.",
        "Nevertheless, such development was projected to be gradual as farm income had yet to recover due to low agricultural prices as well as purchasing power of non-agricultural, low-income groups that was not yet strong.",
        "Moreover, small and medium-sized enterprises as increased competition from modern trade and e-commerce together with automation.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important growth driver but would likely slow down from the previous assessment due to delayed disbursement in capital expenditure.",
        "Going forward, issues that could affect the economic momentum discussed by the Committee were as follows.",
        "First, regarding the regulations on immigrant workers, the situation improved continuously as most entrepreneurs could manage and resume business operations, although SMEs that were dependent on immigrant workers would potentially face higher labor costs.",
        "Meanwhile, consumption spending in areas concentrated with immigrant workers had yet to fully recover.",
        "Second, with regard to the recent floods, the impacts were mostly limited to residential and agricultural areas.",
        "Industrial areas were affected somewhat and already started to improve.",
        "Moreover, the Committee discussed factors underlying the gradual recovery in private consumption despite clear signs of overall economic expansion, attributing to subdued growth in household income and wages.",
        "This was caused in part by structural factors such as a changing employment pattern toward more part-time workers as well as a rising proportion of workers in the service sector, thereby resulting in low wage levels and little wage growth when compared with compensation in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Furthermore, the increased adoption of automation did not result in the propagation of macroeconomic expansion to increases in labor income or wages to the same extent as in the past.",
        "In addition to low wage growth, another reason for the gradual recovery in private consumption was the high level of household debt.",
        "Headline and core inflation slightly increased and was in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Headline inflation picked up following an increase in fresh food and energy prices.",
        "However, given low demand-pull inflation pressures, signs of acceleration in prices of goods had yet to be seen.",
        "Moreover, a gradual pace of wage growth also limited cost-push inflation pressures.",
        "Looking forward, headline inflation was projected to slowly increase, given the recovery in domestic demand, higher oil prices, the excise tax increase, and the impacts of regulations on immigrant workers.",
        "Meanwhile, short- and medium-term inflation expectations slightly decreased possibly because of low headline inflation in the past and previous downward revisions in the inflation projection.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation expectations would likely pick up given an increase in inflation going forward.",
        "In addition, the Committee viewed that many central banks also faced with the challenge of low inflation and increased difficulty in predicting trend inflation due to structural changes, such as e-commerce, trade liberalization, and technological advances, which resulted in lower production costs.",
        "The Committee would continue to closely monitor inflation developments.",
        "Growth in commercial bank loans expanded at a slow pace.",
        "Growth in business loans to large corporates and SMEs slowed down, which was partly due to debt repayment of large corporates as well as a shift toward more equity financing in the real estate and construction sectors.",
        "However, loans to businesses in the energy sector continued to expand, together with other sectors related to merchandise exports and tourism that witnessed increasing loan demand for working capital and fixed asset investment.",
        "Consumer loans expanded in all purposes.",
        "Loan approval rates increased in conjunction with higher consumer and business loan applications.",
        "However, corporate loan utilization rates slightly decelerated.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio started to stabilize except for SMEs in the commercial, industrial, and construction sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, the NPL ratio of consumer loans largely rose in mortgage loans.",
        "Nevertheless, financial institutions were able to maintain cushion against deterioration in credit quality.",
        "The Committee expressed concerns over NPLs of SMEs that would hardly decline despite macroeconomic improvements.",
        "This was because SMEs, particularly small businesses in commercial and construction sectors, were partly affected from structural problems in that current business models could not compete.",
        "Some Committee members noted that should NPLs in consumer loans, especially among lowincome earners, were to increase, commercial banks might tighten credit standards further.",
        "These consumers might consequently resort to alternative financing sources such as saving cooperatives or non-banks, and such developments warranted close monitoring going forward.",
        "Financial stability remained sound but there were pockets of risks that continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "The ratio of household debt to GDP was projected to gradually decline, as seen in almost all loan purposes and especially in personal loans and auto leasing.",
        "Nevertheless, the ratio of household debt to household income remained largely stable given the recent decline in the ratio of household income to GDP.",
        "In addition, households’ ability to cushion against financial shocks would likely decrease as indicated by the survey by the National Statistical Office this year where the ratio of household debt to financial assets increased especially for low-income earners.",
        "Meanwhile, leverage by other non-financial institutions relative to GDP remained stable in line with a gradual recovery in private consumption and private investment.",
        "Nevertheless, there remained risks pertaining debt serviceability of businesses, particularly SMEs, and low-income households.",
        "Regarding asset prices, housing prices including condominiums did not accelerate significantly.",
        "Meanwhile, the stock exchange index increased but the price-earnings ratio was largely unchanged from the historical average.",
        "Volatilities in Thailand’s financial markets stood at a very low level possibly due in part to underpricing of risks, which could lead to increased volatility if market conditions were to turn out different from market expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, risks pertaining to the rollover of unrated bonds continued to ease as reflected in lower outstanding shortterm unrated bonds.",
        "The search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate remained present.",
        "First, foreign investment funds (FIFs) expanded continuously, although risks were limited as most funds invested in countries with investment-grade credit rating.",
        "Nevertheless, it was necessary to continue monitoring risks of concentrated investment in some particular countries.",
        "Second, some saving cooperatives reported strong growth in assets and deposits and in some instances where deposits grew faster than loans invested their surplus liquidity in riskier assets.",
        "The Committee viewed that pursuing policies which would strengthen supervision of saving cooperatives was highly critical.",
        "The Committee emphasized the need to monitor developments of search-for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "Furthermore, some Committee members expressed concerns over the elevated ratio of debt to household income, which would impose persistent debt burden and affect household consumption.",
        "The Committee assessed Thailand’s growth outlook to have improved further from the previous assessment mainly due to merchandise exports and tourism as well as continued domestic demand expansion.",
        "Headline inflation gradually rose as projected on account of increases in fresh food and energy prices, a recovery in domestic demand, an increase in excise tax, as well as impacts from regulations on immigrant workers that might increase overall wages.",
        "Meanwhile, financial conditions remained accommodative and conductive to economic growth as reflected in low corporate funding costs in the credit and bond markets.",
        "Financial stability remained sound but there were pockets of risks that might result in the build-up of vulnerability going forward.",
        "The Committee assessed the benefits and costs as well as trade-offs of policy alternatives and viewed that current accommodative monetary policy stance help support economic growth and foster the return of headline inflation to target, although this might take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follow.",
        "(1) Thailand’s economic growth outlook gained further traction on the back of improved merchandise exports and tourism thanks to a stronger global economic recovery together with continued domestic demand expansion.",
        "Private investment indicators improved across various sectors, while private consumption continued to expand in line with improvements in household purchasing power and consumer confidence.",
        "However, the Committee viewed that the ongoing economic expansion did not fully extend to employment and earnings of low-income earners and SMEs.",
        "This was partly due to structural factors which monetary policy alone could not solve.",
        "Moreover, the baht appreciation in the recent period was in line with regional currencies, while NEER and REER remained largely unchanged.",
        "Overall, the Committee viewed that the degree of monetary policy accommodation should be maintained for some period to support a more robust domestic demand expansion.",
        "(2) Headline inflation slightly increased following a rise in fresh food and energy prices and was expected to slowly edge up on the back of domestic demand recovery, an increase in excise tax, as well as impacts from regulations on immigrant workers.",
        "In addition, the Committee noted that recent below-target inflation was mainly due to supply-side and structural factors; further monetary policy accommodation therefore would not be appropriate and could result in the build-up of vulnerability in the financial system going forward.",
        "Moreover, under the Committee’s assessment the decline in inflation expectations would not lead to deflation risks.",
        "This was because inflation was still expected to continue rising, prices of most goods and services did not fall, and consumption and investment continued to expand.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would continue to closely monitor the impacts of structural factors on developments of inflation going forward.",
        "(3) Overall financial stability remained sound but there remained pockets of risks that might result in the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward.",
        "These included in particular (1) a rising search-for-yield behavior in a prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "This was partly reflected in increased investment in riskier assets, as seen in a continued expansion in foreign investment funds (FIFs), which were concentrated in some countries, and the leverage behavior of some saving cooperatives; (2) debt serviceability of households and SMEs that had yet to improve; and (3) other financial stability problems that might stem from regulatory gaps.",
        "In addition, some Committee members expressed concerns over the property sector given high competition amid oversupply.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor financial stability developments as well as coordinate with financial regulatory authorities to implement measures in an appropriate manner.",
        "In this light, the Committee assessed policy trade-offs and unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving",
        "The global economy was growing well overall.",
        "Thailand’s trading partners continued to expand with improved and more broad-based growth compared with the previous assessment, driven primarily by consumption and manufacturing production in advanced economies as well as Asian exports.",
        "Advanced economies saw robust growth, especially in consumption and manufacturing production, and were supported by improved consumer confidence and labor market conditions.",
        "Private investment showed clearer recovery signs as business confidence improved alongside strong earnings.",
        "Asian economies and China grew faster than previously assessed mainly on the back of exports.",
        "In the period ahead, Asian export growth might slow down somewhat following this year’s acceleration but would still be sustained by growth in advanced economies and demand for electronic goods.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies was increasing gradually thanks to the recovery in oil and fresh food prices, with signs of core inflation picking up in advanced economies.",
        "It was also expected that demand-pull inflationary pressures would increase further going forward as advanced economies edged closer to potential.",
        "Most trading partners’ central banks maintained accommodative monetary policy stance, although some central banks in both advanced economies and Asia began raising policy rates as the economic recovery firmed and inflation approached their respective targets.",
        "Against such backdrop, the Committee viewed that risks to global economic growth were balanced as opposed to the previous assessment where downside risks outweighed upside risks.",
        "In particular, this was due to the increased likelihood that Thailand’s trading partners would achieve faster-than-expected growth as a result of the strong investment outlook in advanced economies as well as additional stimulus measures implemented in China.",
        "Meanwhile, downside risks remained largely unchanged.",
        "Risks pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies as well as geopolitics continued to warrant monitoring going forward.",
        "Sentiments in Asian financial markets improved due to a more positive growth outlook in many economies, potential policy rate hikes as communicated by some central banks in the region, and lower perceived risks of emerging Asian assets.",
        "Meanwhile, the US dollar was negatively affected by uncertainties on the US tax reform and a more gradual monetary policy normalization of the Federal Reserve (Fed).",
        "These developments resulted in continued capital inflows into regional financial markets, although the size of inflows into the Thai bond market was smaller relative to regional peers.",
        "Meanwhile, foreign investors reduced their investment in Thai stocks partly because companies listed on the Stock Exchange of - 2 Thailand (SET) did not benefit from the global economic recovery to the same extent as those listed on regional markets.",
        "Nevertheless, the SET Index still edged up because of purchases by domestic investors.",
        "Short-term bond yields in Thailand remained below the policy rate.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht’s movement relative to those of trading partner currencies was largely unchanged from the previous meeting.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciated slightly in line with Thailand’s improving economic fundamentals.",
        "In the period ahead, exchange rates might undergo volatile movements as a result of external factors especially uncertainties pertaining to the US tax reform as well as the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies in advanced economies.",
        "Hence, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange markets going forward.",
        "The Committee discussed the risk of possible price corrections in US stock and bond markets.",
        "The Committee noted that recent upticks in US stock indices stemmed from more optimistic views regarding the ongoing deregulation policy that would lower operational costs for businesses, together with expectations regarding the outcome of the tax reform bill.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that recent investment decisions in financial markets were mostly driven by short-term factors such as economic outturns compared with market expectations, rather than by medium-term fundamentals such as monetary policy normalization by the Fed or fiscal deficits that would result from the tax reform.",
        "Hence, if investors were to put more weight toward these medium-term factors in their investment decisions, it could lead to significant corrections in US government bond yields, thereby posing a risk to financing conditions for businesses in the period ahead.",
        "The Thai economy gained further traction driven by growth in the external sectors as well as the gradual recovery in domestic demand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports continued to expand in both quantity and price terms as the global economic recovery strengthened.",
        "Tourism also grew given the higher tourist numbers in almost all nationality groups.",
        "In particular, the number of Chinese tourists became higher than that seen prior to the implementation of measures to curb illegal tour operators and was made up of the visitors with higher spending per head.",
        "Regarding the ongoing domestic demand recovery, private consumption continued to expand albeit at a gradual pace given that improvements in income growth were not yet sufficiently broad-based.",
        "While spending on durable goods was growing driven by improved purchasing power of non-agricultural households with higher income, the underlying strength of consumption growth remained soft as income of some non-agricultural households, especially those with lower income, was affected by decreased hiring.",
        "Farm income was gradually improving, although some households were affected by declining agricultural prices.",
        "Meanwhile, household debt remained high and household confidence with regard to future income had yet to show clear improvements.",
        "Private investment picked up at a gradual pace as reflected in outlays for machinery and equipment, as especially reflected by imports of capital goods and sales of commercial vehicles.",
        "Nevertheless, investment in construction slowed down somewhat.",
        "In the period ahead, private investment was projected to continue expanding with support from growing exports and consumption, together with government policies especially infrastructure investment and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) projects.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important growth driver but might slow down somewhat from delayed disbursement for investment spending.",
        "In particular, public investment was projected to decline due to (1) the downward - 3 revision of the supplementary budget for fiscal year 2017 earmarked for carry-over expenditure and (2) the postponement of some state-owned enterprise (SOE) investment plans.",
        "The Committee projected that the Thai economy would achieve a faster growth rate than the previous assessment.",
        "The growth forecast for 2017 was revised to 3.9 percent, up from improved merchandise exports thanks to stronger trading partners’ growth offset the lowerthan-expected growth in public expenditure and domestic demand.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to continue expanding in 2018 with the growth forecast also revised up to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent.",
        "The upward revision was mainly on account of stronger-thanexpected growth in the external sectors, while domestic demand would likely expand at a slightly slower pace than previously assessed due to temporary postponement of some infrastructure investment projects.",
        "On the whole, the Thai economy remained on a steady growth path.",
        "Risks to the growth projection were deemed balanced given increased upside risks from the stronger growth among trading partner economies.",
        "Other upside risks included domestic factors, namely public infrastructure investments and spending of funds accumulated by local administrative organizations that could be implemented faster than expected.",
        "Nevertheless, there remained downside risks stemming from the external front, such as US economic and foreign trade policies as well as geopolitical risks, and domestically from private demand that might not be as strong as expected should the recovery in purchasing power still not broaden out.",
        "The Committee also engaged in an extensive discussion on the various factors that could affect Thailand’s growth outlook.",
        "First, export growth would be expected to decelerate in up strongly in earlier periods as well as the high base due to this year’s export expansion.",
        "In addition, the positive effects of special factors, such as the relocation of production base for electronics and electrical appliances to Thailand and the inventory buildup within the electronics industry, were expected to dissipate.",
        "Nevertheless, the monthly average value of exports for 2018 would likely be higher compared with previous years.",
        "Some Committee members meanwhile viewed that export growth could be stronger than expected due to trading partners’ growth.",
        "Second, the slowdown in public expenditure in 2017 was in part attributed to temporary limitations in accessing construction sites during inclement weather conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, public investment was expected to pick up given the increased budget allocation for investment spending and given SOEs showing readiness for undertaking investment projects.",
        "Some Committee members also expected that the crowding-in effects of public investment on private investment might be larger than expected, especially those related to the EEC projects.",
        "Third, while the Thai economy overall was gaining traction, growth had yet to trickle down sufficiently and in a more broad-based manner to employment and household income.",
        "This was reflected by the decline in employment within non-agricultural sectors, especially the low-paid daily hire employees in manufacturing and construction and the self-employed commercial business owners.",
        "This was in part a result of structural factors such as the adoption of automation by businesses, aging population, and competitiveness issues faced by Thai firms.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that such development was partly cyclical in nature and thus employment conditions should improve as economic growth continued.",
        "Nonetheless, the Committee viewed that employment and household income remained issues that must be monitored closely going forward.",
        "- 4 Headline inflation edged higher in November 2017 mainly as a result of rising energy prices.",
        "Core inflation rose slightly due to the excise tax hike on tobacco as well as the termination of free public bus and train services.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures picked up somewhat but overall remained low, as economic growth was not yet broad-based and labor income had yet to fully recover.",
        "Structural changes also contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s inflation expectations appeared to stabilize after inflation outturns improved.",
        "The Committee revised up the headline inflation forecast for 2017 to an annual average of 0.7 percent on account of higher-than-expected gains in fresh food and oil prices in the third quarter, while the core inflation forecast remained close to previous assessment.",
        "The headline inflation and core inflation projections for 2018 were revised down to annual averages of 1.1 and 0.8 percent, respectively.",
        "This downward revision was due to the fact that the impacts of the excise tax increase and the termination of free public bus and train services were smaller than expected.",
        "Risks to inflation projections were deemed balanced in line with the balance of risks to current growth forecasts.",
        "On the upside, inflation might turn out higher than forecast should crude oil prices pick up further with global growth.",
        "On the downside, inflation might turn out lower than forecast if economic growth turned out below expectations.",
        "Growth in commercial bank loans remained low overall partly due to debt repayment by large corporates as well as the switch to bond and equity financing by businesses in manufacturing, real estate, and construction sectors.",
        "Nevertheless, loans extended to smallto-medium enterprises (SMEs) picked up and broadened to a broader range of businesses, which reflected ongoing economic growth.",
        "Consumer loans also expanded in all purposes.",
        "In addition, increases in loan applications and loan utilization reflected growing demand for business and consumer loans, although commercial banks remained cautious in approving consumer loans.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained stable overall, except for consumer loans which rose across all loan purposes especially housing loans.",
        "NPLs of SMEs started to decline for those in export-related sectors, which were growing well recently, but were still on the rise for those in commerce, construction, and agro-manufacturing.",
        "The Committee still expressed concerns regarding credit quality of SMEs that were unable to adjust to the improved economic conditions sufficiently fast.",
        "In particular, some SMEs were affected by structural problems, namely the inability to adjust their current business models in order to maintain competitiveness.",
        "This was especially the case for retail businesses.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that rising NPLs of SMEs might partly be a result of the debt write-off process which could take time given the lengthy legal processes when involving a large amount of collateral.",
        "The Committee assessed the Thai economy to have gained further traction and would likely achieve faster growth than in the previous assessment, driven by growth in the external sectors as well as a gradual recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, factors underpinning private consumption remained soft.",
        "Headline inflation was still rising at a gradual pace as previously assessed, but the inflation forecasts were revised down slightly mainly because the effects of the excise tax hike and the termination of free public bus and train services were smaller than expected, both of which were non-demand factors.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth as reflected by low funding costs for businesses through both credit and bond markets.",
        "Financial stability remained sound - 5 but there were pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring as they might result in the build-up of financial vulnerabilities going forward.",
        "The Committee considered the benefits and costs of policy alternatives and viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "(1) While the Thai economy gained further traction, it was still below potential and thus inflationary pressures remained subdued.",
        "Although the macroeconomic outlook was clearly improving, with signs of SMEs in many sectors beginning to gain benefits, the factors underpinning domestic demand, especially employment conditions, remained soft.",
        "Together with the effects of elevated household debt, these factors resulted in relatively low demandpull inflationary pressures at present.",
        "In this regard, the Committee viewed that an accommodative monetary policy stance was still necessary to foster stronger domestic demand going forward.",
        "(2) Financial stability remained sound overall.",
        "However, there remained pockets of risks that might result in the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward, for example, underpricing of risks that stemmed from the search-for-yield in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "In particular, there appeared to be signs of risk underpriced on a broad scale including growing household debt, issuance of unrated bonds, investments in non-core business activities by large corporates, and rapid growth of foreign investment funds their developments going forward.",
        "In addition, some Committee members viewed that risks to financial stability had receded somewhat after the implementation of targeted measures and regulatory upgrade by supervisory authorities over the recent periods.",
        "Specifically, these were the implementation of enhanced regulations on credit card and personal loans, revised regulations on the issuances and sales of debt securities, and an enhanced legal framework and supervisory processes for savings cooperatives.",
        "In this light, the Committee assessed policy trade-offs and unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving",
        "The overall growth outlook for Thailand’s trading partner economies improved.",
        "G3 economies continued to gain traction as reflected in manufacturing production and private consumption.",
        "The US economy, in particular, saw continued strengthening of labor market conditions towards full employment as well as a firmer recovery in investment.",
        "These developments led market participants to anticipate that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would continue to raise the federal funds rate this year.",
        "Asian economies continued to recover on the back of exports which benefited from the global demand recovery.",
        "Against this backdrop of continued improvements in the outlook for global growth and headline inflation in many countries, market participants came to expect that further monetary policy easing by most central banks might be less likely in the period ahead.",
        "The global economic recovery still faced many risks.",
        "The Committee assessed that risks associated with the implementation of US economic policies increased from the previous meeting, particularly those regarding shifts in US investment and trade policies as well as the new administration’s stance of foreign trade agreements and potential trade retaliations from US key trading partners.",
        "If such trade policies were to be carried out by the US, its trading partners including Thailand could be affected through both trade and confidence channels.",
        "Meanwhile, there remained risks stemming from financial stability concerns in China, political developments in Europe, and problems faced by the European banking sector.",
        "The Committee viewed that these risks were largely unchanged but would continue to monitor their development closely.",
        "Financial markets remained highly volatile as market participants shifted their focus to monetary policy normalization by the Fed while US economic policies remained uncertain.",
        "Changes in market expectations of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization path led to increased capital flow volatility in both emerging market bonds and equities, including those of Thailand.",
        "On the whole, the baht appreciated against the US dollar in line with movements of regional currencies.",
        "However, the extent of the baht’s appreciation was greater than those of trading partner currencies, partly due to Thailand’s relatively stronger external position as reflected particularly in the country’s large current account surplus, and thus the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) appreciated from the level seen at the prior meeting.",
        "Meanwhile, Thai government bond yields registered around the same levels as the previous meeting, and the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index was down slightly due to the fall in prices of energy stocks.",
        "It was expected that capital flow and exchange rate volatilities would likely remain elevated in the period ahead, and that the baht could move in either direction, depending on the actual implementation of US fiscal stimulus as well as the anticipated pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed the gradual relaxation of exchange controls that could help create more balanced capital flows.",
        "Moreover, in light of highly volatile capital flows, the use of market-based instruments might help reduce capital flow volatility to some extent, which would facilitate orderly exchange rate adjustments.",
        "At the same time, the private sector was encouraged to give more consideration to exchange rate risk management going forward.",
        "Thailand’s growth outlook improved, driven mainly by the continued expansion in external demand which led to a firmer recovery in merchandise exports.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism continued to recover and public expenditure, especially infrastructure investment, remained an important growth driver.",
        "On the other hand, domestic demand continued to recover at a gradual pace and did not gain much so far from the recovery of exports.",
        "Private consumption was supported by higher income and improved confidence but weighed down by household debt which remained elevated despite having leveled off.",
        "Private investment growth was still concentrated in export-related sectors, consistent with the expansion of business credit by commercial banks that also concentrated in these sectors.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a faster pace this year than previously projected.",
        "The growth forecast for 2017 was revised up from 3.2 percent to would continue to expand at 3.6 percent in 2018, driven by both exports and domestic spending.",
        "Notwithstanding, Thailand’s economic growth would proceed amid a large degree of uncertainties on the external front, especially those pertaining to the direction of economic and trade policies of the US which the Committee would continue to monitor closely.",
        "In the Committee’s view, headline inflation was expected to gradually rise.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation might fluctuate in the near term due to the base effect of higher fresh food prices during the drought last year, and could face greater downside risks given that global oil prices might be lower than the current assessment due to higher than expected excess global oil supply.",
        "Meanwhile, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low.",
        "In this light, the Committee revised down the average headline and core inflation forecasts for 2017 slightly to 1.2 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.",
        "Headline and core inflation in 2018 was projected to continue trending upward, averaging at 1.9 percent and 1.0 percent respectively, consistent with the projected increase in oil prices alongside the global economic recovery and the expected rise in demand-pull inflationary pressures as the Thai economy continues to expand.",
        "Going forward, the Committee anticipated headline inflation to gradually rise and return to the midpoint of the target, consistent with the public’s medium-term inflation expectations that remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts.",
        "However, there were pockets of risks that still warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in the quality of loans extended to households and businesses, especially small-and-mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the search-for-yield behavior that might lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "On the development of risks related to recent defaults of unrated bonds issued by certain companies, the event appeared to have limited impacts on financial conditions, as most unrated bond issuers that did not default were still able to roll over their debt or to obtain financing from alternative sources.",
        "Costs of financing through unrated bonds also appeared to be more varied depending on the financial health of the issuers, which reflected increased market ability to distinguish risks across different issuers.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments of unrated bonds and other parts of the financial system for signs of risk underpricing.",
        "In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that Thailand’s growth outlook improved, and that headline inflation would continue to gradual rise and return to the midpoint of the target in the future period.",
        "However, the growth observed so far still had some vulnerabilities, and was concentrated largely in export-related economic activities which would remain subject to a large degree of risks.",
        "Headline inflation faced increased downside risks from developments in global oil prices, while demand-pull inflationary pressures also remained low.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative despite having tightened somewhat, partly because the baht appreciated against major trading partner currencies which might not be as beneficial to the economy as it could be.",
        "Hence, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting in order to maintain accommodative financial conditions which would facilitate the Given that economic growth in the period ahead remained susceptible to risks, the Committee saw the need for concrete structural reforms that would uplift the competitiveness of Thai businesses and help cushion the impacts of adverse shocks to the economy.",
        "Additionally, although financial stability remained sound, some committee members viewed that imbalances in the financial system could continue to accumulate under the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "This was particularly seen in the recent increase in lending and borrowing through channels other than commercial banks and specialized financial institutions due partly to different regulatory standards across different types of financial institutions.",
        "In this regard, close coordination between regulatory bodies would be critical in closing such gaps as well as in monitoring and addressing risks in an appropriate and timely manner.",
        "Going forward, the Committee concurred that sufficiently accommodative monetary policy remained necessary given that economic growth was still in the early stages and not yet broad-based.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support economic growth and ensure financial stability.",
        "The growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners improved further from the previous meeting.",
        "The US was projected to continue expanding on account of private consumption and investment, which began to be more broad-based, together with stronger labor market conditions.",
        "The hurricanes would have a negative impact on the US economy only for a short period of time, while the government shutdown and debt default were less likely to occur.",
        "Japan expanded on the back of continued growth in consumption as reflected in improvement in consumer confidence.",
        "Regarding the euro area, labor market conditions improved, while most member countries recorded higher growth than long-term averages.",
        "Accommodative financial conditions and improved consumer confidence would support a growth momentum going forward.",
        "China expanded at a slower pace owing mainly to softer investment by state-owned enterprises.",
        "Looking ahead, investment in certain sectors, particularly real estate, would likely slow down following more stringent measures to safeguard financial stability.",
        "Asian economies continued to recover thanks to exports which benefited from growing external demand from major advanced economies and greater imports from China.",
        "These would support manufacturing growth, especially in electronic goods, in the region in the period ahead, underpinned by domestic demand as consumer confidence picked up.",
        "With regard to monetary policy, most central banks maintained their accommodative stance given the low inflation environment.",
        "However, some central banks with relatively high policy interest rates cut their policy rates to boost economic growth momentum.",
        "Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve (Fed) remained on the path of monetary policy normalization, with a high possibility that the Fed would hike the federal funds rate one more time this year and commence its balance sheet reduction in October in a gradual manner in order to reduce any possible impacts on the financial markets.",
        "The Committee assessed that risks to the growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners remained despite decreasing somewhat given a delayed implementation of the US foreign trade policy.",
        "However, global geopolitical risks heightened slightly from tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the responses by major advanced economies.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets improved on the back of a stronger global economic recovery and a gradual rise in the policy rates of major advanced economies.",
        "Nevertheless, asset prices experienced volatile movements in some periods resulting from conflicts in the Korean Peninsula and political issues in the US, which led to negative investor sentiments on the US dollar.",
        "Combined with accommodative global financial conditions, such developments resulted in continued capital inflows to regional securities markets, which caused appreciation of most regional currencies.",
        "The baht appreciated against the US dollar from the previous meeting due to the weakening of the US dollar and Thailand’ s large current account surplus given continued improvement in income from merchandise exports and tourism.",
        "Nevertheless, the baht appreciation was in line with regional currencies so the baht’ s movement relative to those of trading partners was mostly unchanged.",
        "This was reflected in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) that remained largely stable.",
        "Looking ahead, exchange rates might experience higher volatilities due to uncertainties on the external front, such as uncertainties pertaining to US economic policies and monetary policy conducts of major advanced economies, which might affect business adjustments.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments of capital flows and in the foreign exchange markets.",
        "Furthermore, the private sector was encouraged to give more consideration to exchange rate risk management which included the use of foreign exchange hedging instruments or invoicing in local currencies to reduce the possible impact from volatilities of the US dollar.",
        "With regard to the bond market, long-term government bond yields decreased owing to higher foreign demand.",
        "Short-term yields picked up somewhat from selling pressures from domestic investors as they adjusted their portfolios to invest in higher yielding assets.",
        "However, short-term yields were still lower than the policy rate as a result of the reduction in the issuances of short-term BOT bonds and an absence of Treasury bill issuances at the end of the fiscal year.",
        "With regard to the stock market, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index edged up in line with improved global sentiments and as domestic political uncertainties subsided.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to gain further traction driven by external sectors.",
        "Merchandise exports continued to expand both in terms of volume and prices as a result of strong growth among Thailand’s trading partners and global trade expansion.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism recorded stronger growth thanks to regional economic expansion and the increasing number of Chinese tourists.",
        "Domestic demand continued to recover and started to be more broad-based.",
        "Private consumption exhibited stronger expansion in the services and durable goods categories and would likely improve further driven by non-agricultural households’ spending and improved consumer confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, such improvement was projected to be gradual as purchasing power of low-income and agricultural households was not sufficiently strong.",
        "Private investment recovered at a gradual pace.",
        "Investment in machinery and equipment was observed across various businesses.",
        "The total investment value of project applications also increased given better investment sentiments that were consistent with improvements in external sectors and private consumption.",
        "However, some businesses still delayed their investment as there was still excess production capacity, and they were also awaiting greater clarity in the government’s policies, especially those regarding investment on infrastructure projects.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important growth driver but would likely slow down due to prior accelerated disbursement in the previous period.",
        "Some government agencies were also constrained by disbursement efficiency.",
        "Meanwhile, the promulgation of the Public Procurement and Supplies Management Act B.E.",
        "2560 might result in slight delays in the disbursement of some state agencies during the initial phase, particularly local administrative organizations that had not previously operated under this system.",
        "Going forward, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand further, recording 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2018, which was higher than previous projection at 3.5 and the second quarter, coupled with continued improvements in merchandise and services exports attributable to a better growth outlook of Thailand’s trading partners, increasing preorders from abroad, and improved consumer sentiments across various businesses.",
        "Moreover, fiscal impetus remained and would continue to drive private investment going forward, in terms of both public investment expenditure and the promulgation on the Eastern Special Economic Zone Act, which would help boost business confidence as well as attract greater foreign investment.",
        "Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding the growth forecast declined given stronger economic growth of Thailand’s trading partners, but upside risks remained dominated by downside risks, namely, external risks that might affect trading partners as well as domestic risks pertaining to household purchasing power that did not yet sufficiently recover.",
        "Moreover, regulations on immigrant workers might restrain economic activities in the short run, while public expenditure might slow down from the impact of the promulgation of the Public Procurement Act during the initial phase.",
        "The Committee continued to monitor developments of certain factors that could affect the overall growth and inflation outlook.",
        "First, regarding the impacts from regulations on immigrant workers, the numbers of immigrant worker registrations in small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs)—in particular, hotels and restaurants, constructions, and trade— were still low despite the delay in enforcement until the end of this year.",
        "These sectors might thus face risks of labor shortages in the period ahead.",
        "However, impacts in agricultural and household sectors were judged to be less, as most of immigrant workers in these sectors had already registered.",
        "Meanwhile, employment of immigrant workers in manufacturing and services sectors of large businesses might not be much affected since these sectors mostly employed legal workers, but labor costs would likely increase.",
        "The Committee would therefore closely monitor the impacts of these regulations especially on the private consumption outlook, as some immigrant workers had left the country, and the impacts on the inflation outlook due to a possible wage rise as labor market tightened.",
        "Second, regarding sectoral economic improvement recently observed, economic expansion remained concentrated in medium- and large-sized firms in export-related businesses that recorded improvements in production and employment.",
        "In addition, there were signs of inventory accumulation after much decumulation in the previous period.",
        "Nevertheless, wages and employment in other sectors, such as those in domestic-oriented and agricultural businesses, did not reflect a strong recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Non-agricultural employment picked up only in middle- to high-income groups.",
        "Meanwhile, employment in a low-income group had yet to fully recover, which was partly due to the increasing adoption of automation in businesses.",
        "Headline inflation in August 2017 picked up driven mainly by an increase in energy prices, although fresh food prices continued to decline.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation remained stable at a low level in line with low demand-pull inflationary pressures, which were in part attributable to (1) economic expansion that was not yet broad-based and (2) pass-through from lower fresh food and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices to prepared food prices.",
        "According to the Committee’s assessment of the impact of supply-side factors on the inflation outlook, falling prices of fresh food and LPG partly caused prices of food items in the core inflation basket to stabilize at the low level.",
        "Overall non-food components in core inflation also remained largely unchanged, given that businesses continued to increase sales promotion as domestic demand improved only gradually.",
        "Moreover, structural changes, including increasing roles of modern trade, e-commerce, and globalization, helped facilitate consumers to compare prices and enhanced competitions among entrepreneurs.",
        "Technological advancements also led to lower costs of production which partly resulted in headline inflation rising at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was projected to rise albeit more gradually compared with the previous assessment, weighed on by the decline in fresh food prices as a result of higher output of vegetable and fruits amid favorable weather conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low and would be subject to structural changes.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation was projected to slowly rise on the back of domestic demand recovery and an increase in excise tax, together with impacts from regulations on immigrant workers that might affect wages in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee therefore revised down headline inflation projection for 2017 and 2018 to 0.6 and 1.2 percent, respectively, while maintaining the forecast of core inflation for 2017 and 2018 at 0.6 and 0.9 percent, respectively.",
        "In addition, risks to the inflation outlook were judged to be balanced.",
        "The downside risks remained given that economic growth might be lower than expected, while the upside risks to inflation could stem from (1) regulations on immigrant workers that might result in a tightening labor market and increasing wages and the midpoint of the target.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor inflation developments and continue to communicate with public to anchor public’s inflation expectations within the target band going forward.",
        "Growth in commercial bank loans increased but was concentrated only in some businesses.",
        "Business loans extended to large corporates remained largely stable, while loans extended to SMEs gradually expanded but were rather concentrated in manufacturing, real estate, and public utility sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, consumer loan expansion was observed in all loan purposes.",
        "The approval rate rose in tandem with higher loan demand from both consumers and businesses, while the credit utilization rate remained stable overall.",
        "Regarding the quality of consumer loans, the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio increased at a slower pace.",
        "However, the NPL ratio of housing loans continued to rise.",
        "As for the quality of business loans, NPLs of large businesses remained stable while those of SMEs—particularly smaller businesses in commercial, construction, and industrial sectors—picked up, reflecting an economic recovery that was not yet broad-based.",
        "This was partly because such businesses confronted competitiveness challenges arising from constraints on adaptation to economic structural changes such as the increasing roles of technology in business operations.",
        "Nevertheless, NPLs of SMEs in export-oriented industries decelerated somewhat in line with export expansion.",
        "However, the Committee expressed concerns over the high level of NPLs that would remained elevated in the short run.",
        "This was because NPLs were highly concentrated in some businesses such as large businesses in certain industries with NPLs unlikely to decline, while NPLs of smaller businesses in the commercial sector continued to rise.",
        "Thus, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor developments of NPLs going forward.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would grow at a faster pace than the previous assessment on account of merchandise exports and tourism, while domestic demand continued to recover and began to be more broad-based.",
        "Headline inflation was softer than previously projected mainly because of supply-side factors, but was expected to slowly rise given domestic demand recovery, an increase in excise tax, as well as impacts from regulations on immigrant workers that might result in wage increases.",
        "In addition, overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Thus, the Committee viewed that current monetary policy accommodation helped support the economic growth and foster the return of headline inflation to target, although this might take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follow.",
        "(1) Thailand’s growth outlook was expected to gain further traction driven mainly by external factors, while the strength of domestic demand recovery must be monitored.",
        "The Committee viewed that a stronger global trade recovery and a continued improvement in income of Thailand’s trading partners would be important drivers to support the continuation of growth in merchandise exports and tourism, while these sectors would unlikely be affected significantly by the baht appreciation.",
        "Moreover, the baht appreciation in the recent period was in line with regional currencies, and Thailand’s low inflation relative to those of trading partners resulted in only a slight appreciation of the REER since the beginning of the year.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, the ongoing expansion began to be more broad-based.",
        "However, increased economic activities were still concentrated in export-related and large businesses and had not yet lead to stronger income and purchasing power, especially those of low-income households.",
        "Meanwhile, SMEs still confronted competitiveness challenges.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that a policy mix between macroeconomic policy and more targeted measures as well as structural economic reforms was necessary in dealing with uneven economic expansion.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary policy played its role in fostering sufficiently accommodative financial conditions which were conducive to the continuation of economic growth and orderly adjustments of the private sector.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was softer than previously assessed due mainly to supply-side factors but was expected to slowly rise.",
        "The Committee viewed that headline inflation was expected to edge up in 2018 following a domestic demand recovery and an increase in excise tax.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation would rise at a slower pace than in the past due to structural factors.",
        "These included the increasing role of modern trade and e-commerce, together with competition in global trade.",
        "Thus, the Committee would closely monitor the implications of structural changes for inflation dynamics and the monetary policy conduct.",
        "Moreover, some Committee members noted that the effect of a policy rate cut to increase inflationary pressures and foster a swifter return of headline inflation to target would be limited, as low inflation was caused by supply-side and structural factors.",
        "Financial conditions remained accommodative for extended periods and did not pose any difficulties on investment according to entrepreneurs.",
        "Moreover, debt accumulated by low-income households remained elevated and might limit their abilities to additionally leverage despite falling borrowing costs.",
        "Lower interest rates might also induce medium- to high-income households, which mostly hold bank deposits, to enhance return by investing in riskier assets instead of increasing consumption.",
        "Furthermore, lower interest rates might weigh on purchasing power and consumption of elderly people relying on savings and interest incomes from savings deposits.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that might result in the buildup of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward which continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "These included in particular a rising search-for-yield behavior in a low interest rate environment, together with other financial stability problems especially those stemming from regulatory gaps.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that developments in monitoring processes and analyses on financial stability were essential for monetary policy formulation under flexible inflation targeting, which required careful considerations on economic and financial risks, while striking a right balance overall between economic growth, inflation, and financial stability.",
        "In this light, the Committee unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving financial stability."

        "China would moderate in line with the government’s target thanks to the prudent stimulus measures, including tax cuts and accommodative monetary policy.",
        "These measures would foster quality growth despite headwinds from uncertainties pertaining to trade protectionist measures.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would gain traction from merchandise exports in line with improvements in global trade volume, the electronic cycle, and trade negotiations between the US and China.",
        "In the period ahead, economic growth would be driven by favorable private consumption and employment as well as more government stimulus.",
        "Monetary policies of trading partners were accommodative, particularly after the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) continuously cut policy rates and injected liquidity into the financial system in the second half of 2019.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would ease monetary policy further if economic growth weakened significantly.",
        "Most of the other regional central banks kept policy rates unchanged since the previous meeting.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a probability of trading partner’s economic growth being lower than the baseline projection due to higher medium- to long-term risks as a result of risks to global financial stability.",
        "Lower-for-longer policy rates would encourage greater leverage by businesses, non-banks, and public sectors in many countries.",
        "Moreover, investors would search for higher yields across almost all asset classes, which could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "In addition, some other risks still warranted close monitoring, including (1) trade tensions that could be more intensified and prolonged than previously assessed, especially trade negotiations between the US and China, as well as the likelihood that the US would increase tariffs on all auto imports in the future, (2) uncertainties regarding the timeline and outcome of Brexit, and (3) geopolitical risks that could become widespread and intensified, particularly recurring protests in several countries which exhibited common patterns.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to monitor developments in the trading partner economies, together with the risks mentioned above, and closely evaluate their impacts on the Thai economy that could occur through various linkages.",
        "Sentiments in the global financial markets improved in the short term due to the prospects of an agreement between the US and China over the phase one trade deal, greater clarity on Brexit, as well as stabilizing economic data in advanced economies.",
        "Consequently, asset prices in the global financial markets became less volatile.",
        "Moreover, the continuation of accommodative monetary policy by advanced economy central banks was an additional positive factor contributing to risk-on sentiment and rising prices of most risky assets.",
        "Regarding domestic financial markets, the policy rate cut in the previous meeting contributed to a decline in short-term Thai government bond yields.",
        "Meanwhile, long-term government bond yields increased in line with the US counterpart.",
        "Nonetheless, an increase was limited owing to higher demand for long-term Thai government bonds from both domestic and foreign investors, after an increase in the weights of Thai bonds in a benchmark index for global government bond investment.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht remained broadly unchanged from the previous meeting, exhibiting two-way movements and becoming more in line with regional currencies.",
        "The baht initially depreciated after the policy interest rate cut and the announcement of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations.",
        "Moreover, latest weaker-than-expected economic outturns caused movements in the baht to diverge from those of other safe-haven assets such as the yen and gold prices.",
        "Nevertheless, the continuation of the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy and better global financial market sentiment resulted in US dollar depreciation.",
        "In addition, a credit rating agency upgraded Thailand’s credit rating outlook to positive.",
        "There was thus subsequently some appreciation pressure on the Thai baht.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due to both external and domestic factors.",
        "Such factors included, for example, uncertainties regarding trade negotiations between the US and China that could be prolonged, geopolitical risks, the potential slowdown of global and Thai economies, as well as the monetary policy outlook of advanced economies.",
        "These factors could affect cross-border capital flows and cause volatility in Thai asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee remained concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to continue to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows amid heightened external uncertainties.",
        "The Committee would also monitor the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows and consider implementing additional measures if necessary.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than the previous projection and further below its potential.",
        "Merchandise exports would contract more than the previous forecast and recover slowly.",
        "This would be due to (1) the global trade volume decelerating more than expected from trade tensions and (2) structural changes in the manufacturing sector affecting export competitiveness.",
        "Exports of services would continue to expand on the back of increasing tourist figures in almost all nationalities.",
        "Private consumption in the final quarter of this year would expand at a faster pace than the previous forecast, supported mainly by government stimulus measures.",
        "However, private consumption growth would be slower-than-expected next year due to such measures phasing out, falling household income and employment, particularly in export-related manufacturing sectors, as well as drought and elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment would expand at a lower rate than previously forecasted partly from delays in some public-private partnership infrastructure investment projects.",
        "Nevertheless, private investment would be supported by the gradual recovery in exports and the progress of other infrastructure investment projects.",
        "Public expenditure would grow at a lower rate than the previous forecast partly due to delays in some state-owned enterprise investment projects and a reduction in state-owned enterprise investment budgets for fiscal year 2020.",
        "The Committee projected economic growth to be 2.5 percent in 2019 and 2.8 percent in 2020, a downward revision from the previous _Monetary Policy Report at 2.8 and 3.3 percent_ respectively.",
        "However, the economy was expected to accelerate in 2021 due to the postponement of some public-private partnership projects and public investment projects to factors.",
        "First, global trade volume and trading partner economies could slow down more than assessed from re-intensifying trade tensions.",
        "Second, domestic demand could soften more than expected from delays in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E.",
        "2563 subdued more than expected in tandem with moderating household income given various factors, including the impact of the slowdown in exports on employment and intensifying natural disasters.",
        "Third, global financial stability risks could affect the Thai economy in the medium term.",
        "Nevertheless, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a higher rate than the baseline projection owing to (1) higher-than-expected trading partners’ economic growth in the case of additional stimulus policies, alleviating trade tensions, as well as a faster recovery in the electronic cycle, and (2) higher-than-expected domestic demand given public infrastructure investment and public-private partnership investment projects, together with potentially additional government stimulus measures.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussions regarding economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee assessed that, despite better prospects of global trade volume, Thai exports would not fully gain benefits due to some structural factors.",
        "For example, (1) global trade volume improvements occurred in countries with small contributions to Thai exports and The Committee furthermore discussed deterioration in employment across sectors.",
        "The Committee would in particular monitor structural changes in the labor market which would affect employment and private consumption in the period ahead.",
        "Such changes included automation, changes of the employment pattern from full-time to temporary contracts, as well as challenges in upskilling and reskilling the labor force.",
        "The annual averages of headline inflation in 2019 and 2020 were projected to be lower than the previous forecast and below the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "This would be due to lower-than-expected energy prices in line with a subdued global economy and increased energy supply, as well as the lower-than-expected minimum wage increase in 2020.",
        "Core inflation was expected to increase in line with better economic prospects next year, resulting in headline inflation rising toward the target in the second half of 2021.",
        "Risks to the headline and core inflation projections remained tilted to the downside in line with risks to the economic projection.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than the previous forecast and below its potential due to the contraction in merchandise exports which affected employment and domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative as a result of the previous two policy rate cuts.",
        "Real interest rates and government bond yields remained at low levels.",
        "Liquidity in the financial system remained ample.",
        "Meanwhile, exchange rate appreciation against trading partner currencies abated.",
        "The recent movements of the Thai baht were two-way and more in line with regional currencies.",
        "Financial stability had already been addressed to some extent but there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring.",
        "The Committee viewed that more accommodative monetary policy stance in the recent period would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target.",
        "The Committee therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.25 percent at this meeting and would assess risks in the period ahead in order to deliberate appropriate monetary policy.",
        "The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their 1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously projected and below its potential due to larger-than-expected contraction in merchandise exports and its slower-than-expected recovery which affected employment and domestic demand.",
        "Nonetheless, the global economic outlook would start to stabilize and contribute to gradual improvement of the Thai exports and economic growth next year.",
        "Public expenditure and private investment would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to delays in some investment projects.",
        "Private consumption would grow at a slower rate owing to declining household income and employment in various sectors, especially in the export-related manufacturing sectors.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter uncertainties from both external and domestic factors including (1) uncertain trade tensions and geopolitical risks that could dampen the economic outlook of trading partners, especially China and Asia, (2) uncertainties pertaining to public expenditure and the progress of important public-private partnership infrastructure investment projects and the knock-on effects on private investment, (3) more-than-expected slowdown in private consumption as a result of declining employment and income, and (4) risks from drought next year which could affect agricultural production and income.",
        "The Committee remained concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies despite its slower pace and two-way movements over the recent period.",
        "The exports and overall economy remained affected, particularly production and employment in export-related manufacturing sectors.",
        "Businesses profitability and liquidity were also impinged.",
        "Moreover, debt servicing capability worsened in those industries exacerbated by exports.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to (1) closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows, (2) monitor the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows, and (3) consider implementing additional measures if necessary.",
        "2) Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target in 2019 and 2020 due to lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with subdued global economic growth and increasing energy supply.",
        "Core inflation would increase in line with the improving economic outlook.",
        "In the period ahead, the Committee viewed that inflation would face uncertainties from oil price fluctuations and weather conditions.",
        "Moreover, structural changes such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that more accommodative monetary policy in the recent period would support the rise of the headline inflation toward target within the second half of 3) Some financial system risks had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.",
        "For instance, property sector risks abated after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure.",
        "This was reflected by moderation in speculation and adjustments of developers.",
        "However, other financial stability risks had yet to improve and thus warranted continued monitoring.",
        "First, debt servicing capability of households and SMEs could worsen amid economic slowdown, particularly in the case of further negative income shocks, while elevated household debt could build up vulnerabilities in the household sector.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks, especially by large corporates and saving cooperatives.",
        "Third, the property sector remained oversupplied in some areas.",
        "Given the outlook of economic growth below its potential with some remaining risks to financial stability, the Committee viewed that the policy interest rate, along with microprudential and macroprudential measures, should be appropriately combined to address financial stability risks.",
        "Moreover, the Committee supported the Bank of Thailand to cooperate with related organizations in order to push forward structural measures to address household and SME debt problems.",
        "Such measures included putting into practice guidelines for responsible lending, debt restructuring and the debt clinic, and building financial discipline as well as promoting household savings.",
        "The Committee also saw a need to continue monitoring impacts of the implemented measures, especially those on the overall economy, and study additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee engaged in a discussion regarding monetary policy transmission after the policy rate cut.",
        "The Committee viewed that benchmark lending rates and time deposit rates along with overall short-term government bond yields declined in line with the policy rate cut.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the economic growth, inflation, and financial stability together with other associated risks in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy coordination between related public and private organizations to support an economic recovery and to restructure the economy, given that the Thai economy would face with structural problems affecting competitiveness and the economic growth outlook going forward that should be firmly addressed by all related parties.",
        "Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace.",
        "Advanced economies and China were expected to grow at a slower pace in line with manufacturing production and exports owing to intensifying and expanding international trade tensions.",
        "The prolonged trade tensions began to affect consumption and investment confidence.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would grow moderately due to a fall in merchandise exports.",
        "Merchandise exports would contract in line with the global economy and trade volume that were affected by trade protectionism, the Japan–Korea dispute and a longer-than-expected down cycle of electronic products.",
        "Overall monetary policy of trading partners in both advanced and regional economies would be more accommodative to shore up the weakening economic outlook.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its policy rate in July 2019, and one additional rate cut was expected within this year.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB), despite having kept its policy rate unchanged so far, began signaling more accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The ECB could cut its policy rate if economic growth weakened significantly and could also inject additional liquidity into the financial system through the third Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations Indonesia, and the Reserve Bank of India became more accommodative.",
        "Moreover, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut their policy rates as well.",
        "The Committee assessed that trading partner economies and global trade volume would expand at a slower pace due to (1) trade protectionism that could be prolonged and intensified, after the US announced a prospective 10% tariff on 300 billion US dollars’ worth of Chinese imports and designated China as a currency manipulator, and (2) increased risks of a no-deal Brexit.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor developments in advanced economies and China that could affect domestic demand, together with geopolitical risks that could become widespread.",
        "The Committee would consider potential impacts on the Thai economy through various linkages, as well as consider monetary policy stance of various countries that could affect capital flows and the Thai baht.",
        "More accommodative monetary policy stance of advanced economy and regional central banks partially shored up sentiments in financial markets.",
        "In particular, the likelihood of the Fed and ECB policy rate cuts during the rest of this year increased.",
        "Nevertheless, concerns in global financial markets grew due to intensifying and expanding trade tensions, especially after the US announced additional tariffs on Chinese imports and designated China as a currency manipulator.",
        "Together with the weakening global economic outlook, these factors increased volatility in most asset prices and lowered risky asset prices.",
        "Regarding domestic financial markets, there were capital outflows from the short-term Thai government bond market government bond and equity markets due to (1) an increase in the weights of Thai assets in the MSCI indices and (2) an upgrade in Thailand’s sovereign credit rating outlook by some credit rating agencies.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields declined in line with long-term US government bond yields as a result of more accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "On exchange rates, the measures to enhance surveillance of short-term capital flows limited in part the channels through which speculation on baht appreciation could occur.",
        "The volatility of the baht against the US dollar gradually subsided.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated slightly.",
        "Nonetheless, after the US announced tariffs on Chinese imports and designated China as a currency manipulator, investors sold off assets in Asia due to the region’s high interconnectedness with China.",
        "Safe-haven asset prices rose, including the yen, gold, and the baht.",
        "In addition, Thailand faced a significant current account surplus.",
        "At the same time, gold trading activities by domestic investors put selling pressures on the US dollar.",
        "These factors caused the baht to strengthen against the US dollar and the NEER to appreciate since the previous meeting.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due to various factors, including (1) prolonged trade tensions which could intensify and broaden to other countries, (2) increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and (3) monetary policy stance of advanced economy central banks, especially the Fed and the ECB, which could lead to more volatile asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee remained concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, which could affect the economy to a larger degree amid intensifying trade tensions.",
        "The Committee also noted that Thai assets remained supported by sound external fundamentals and that Thailand had low exposure to adverse impacts of trade protectionism compared with other countries.",
        "These factors could continue to pressure the baht in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee would therefore closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows as well as assess the need of additional appropriate measures.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a slower pace than previously estimated and below its potential.",
        "The slowdown was due to merchandise exports contraction that started to affect domestic demand.",
        "Merchandise exports were expected to contract more than the previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade volume owing to intensifying and expanding trade tensions as well as a longer-than-expected down cycle of electronic products.",
        "In addition, there was a sign that exports in the third quarter of this year would contract more than previously assessed.",
        "Exports of services would grow at a lower rate due to the global economic slowdown and the impact of baht appreciation on some tourist nationalities.",
        "Private consumption was expected to decelerate more than previously assessed on account of (1) declining non-farm income and employment, particularly overtime employment in the export-related manufacturing sectors, and (2) declining farm income caused by drought.",
        "Moreover, consumption would be restrained by elevated debt, while consumer confidence weakened.",
        "Nevertheless, government stimulus measures would support consumption in the period ahead to some extent.",
        "Private investment would expand at a slower pace, partly as a result of the continuing export contraction and moderating domestic demand while investment confidence softened.",
        "However, the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed partly because of budget disbursement constraints as well as the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion about the Thai economic outlook, particularly domestic demand which was showing signs of a slowdown.",
        "Moderating private investment and employment in export-related manufacturing sectors would weigh on consumption in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor farm income, and household debt serviceability that could have implications for future consumption, and (2) the relocation of production base to Thailand, together with policy implementation by the new government, public expenditure, and the progress of major infrastructure investment that would have knock-on effects on future private investment.",
        "The Committee also noted that new government policies should be careful not to encourage additional household leverage that could aggravate household debt, which constituted a structural problem that had weighed on private consumption for some period.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Although fresh food inflation would be slightly higher than the previous projection in tandem with higher-than-expected fruit prices, the increase could not offset the decline in energy and core inflation.",
        "Energy inflation would weaken in line with lower-thanexpected Dubai crude oil prices resulting from slower global economic growth.",
        "Core inflation would decrease on the back of subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Short-term and long-term inflation expectations remained close to the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to a more persistent inflation than in the past.",
        "Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production.",
        "Financial system risks still posed vulnerabilities to financial stability.",
        "On leverage, household debt in the second quarter of this year continuously increased in line with credit expansion of commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions.",
        "Expansion in consumer loans, especially personal loans, for which lending standards became more lenient, warranted monitoring.",
        "The calculation in order to collate DSR data should additional measures intended to curb household debt become necessary in the future.",
        "Moreover, the share of households sensitive to negative income shocks had increased, which could weigh on household debt serviceability.",
        "Therefore, the channels through which negative income shocks could affect such households during an economic slowdown and drought conditions should be closely monitored.",
        "Meanwhile, corporate debt grew at a slower pace, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing and trade sectors.",
        "The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of corporate debt was largely stable due to credit portfolio quality management.",
        "Regarding the property sector, after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure, adjustments of households and commercial banks were in line with target.",
        "Speculation abated as reflected in (1) the slower growth of new mortgage loans, especially for high-rise units in the second quarter of this year, and (2) the decline in house prices consistent with real estate demand.",
        "Moreover, commercial banks’ credit underwriting standards were tighter.",
        "The average LTV and repayment tenor declined while the loan-to-income (LTI) ratio was stable.",
        "Nevertheless, search-for-yield behavior that led to underpricing of risks still persisted in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "This was reflected in expanding investments in high-yield mutual funds such as foreign investment funds (FIF), which posed concentration risks in some countries.",
        "The asset size of saving cooperatives subsided in line with moderating deposits and equities of members.",
        "Nevertheless, large corporates increased their fundraising in the prolonged low interest rate environment through the bond and loan markets.",
        "The Committee viewed that the macroprudential measures previously implemented helped curb vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent.",
        "The Committee would continuously monitor (1) the impacts of the revised LTV measure and the ensuing property sector developments, (2) adjustments of property developers and the oversupply situation, (3) the asset size of and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and (4) fundraising by large corporates that might underprice risks.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that household debt was a critical and urgent structural risk that would require a multi-dimensional resolution.",
        "Cooperation between various parties was needed to reduce leverage and to restructure existing debt.",
        "In this light, greater emphasis should be placed on borrowers’ debt serviceability.",
        "The Committee thus directed a study of additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to contraction in merchandise exports that started to affect domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative.",
        "Financial stability had already been taken care of to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring.",
        "Most Committee members judged that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target.",
        "The Committee therefore voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.75 to 1.50 percent.",
        "Two members voted to maintain the policy rate The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their 1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed and below potential.",
        "This would be mainly due to merchandise exports that contracted more than previously expected in tandem with the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade volume as a result of intensifying and expanding trade tensions.",
        "Going forward, the situation could be aggravated and become prolonged.",
        "This would affect global trade volume and trading partners’ demand more than previously assessed.",
        "Moreover, the tourism sector would grow at a slower pace in line with the global economic outlook, with some tourist nationalities affected by the baht appreciation.",
        "Furthermore, the impacts of merchandise export slowdown on domestic demand started to be seen.",
        "Private consumption and investment would decelerate due to (1) weakening household and business confidence, (2) contracting non-farm income and employment in export-oriented manufacturing sectors, (3) declining farm income which was partly affected by drought, and (4) restrained household purchasing power due to elevated household debt.",
        "Meanwhile, public expenditure would decelerate more than previously assessed as a result of budget disbursement constraints and the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter heightened uncertainties mainly from the external front that could affect the growth prospect going forward.",
        "These uncertainties included, in particular, (1) trade protectionism that could be prolonged and expanded, (2) a worse-than-expected growth outlook for advanced economies and China that could affect domestic demand, as well as the increased likelihood of no-deal Brexit and heightened geopolitical risks, and (3) more accommodative monetary policy stance of advanced economy and regional central banks.",
        "In addition, the Committee would continue to monitor policy implementation by the new government as well as public expenditure, together with the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment, which could affect growth in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee assessed that sustained exchange rate appreciation might result in greater effects on exports amid the slowdown in trading partner economies and heightened international competition.",
        "Signs of impacts on profits, debt serviceability, and overtime employment cuts began to be seen in some export-related sectors.",
        "If these impacts were broadened to other sectors, the purchasing power of households related to export firms and overall economic growth could be affected.",
        "2) The annual average of headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target due to (1) energy prices declining at a fast pace and (2) core inflation being lowest in nine years and projected to slow down in line with subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "The slower core inflation outlook was partly reflected in weaker earnings and employment of low-income households.",
        "On the other hand, fresh food prices were expected to rise.",
        "The Committee viewed that inflation projection would face uncertainties from oil price fluctuations, weather and drought conditions, as well as policy uncertainty regarding the minimum wage increase this year.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes, such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs, could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "3) Some financial system risks which might pose vulnerabilities to future financial stability had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.",
        "For instance, property sector risks abated after the implementation of the revised LTV measure.",
        "This was reflected by reduced real estate speculation and tightened commercial banks’ underwriting standards for mortgage loans.",
        "Moreover, banks would increase caution in extending loans during the economic downturn.",
        "However, other financial stability risks had not improved and warranted continued monitoring.",
        "These included high and rising household leverage as a result of loan expansion by commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions.",
        "In particular, more relaxed personal loan underwriting standards could encourage households to increase vulnerabilities.",
        "The Committee would also monitor worsening debt serviceability of SMEs, as indicated by elevated NPL and the rising trend of special mention loans (SM) amid economic slowdown.",
        "Another financial stability risk to be monitored was search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment, which could lead to underpricing of risks, especially those related to the cooperatives system and leverage by large corporates.",
        "Given the softening economic outlook and prolonged low interest rates, the Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures would need to play an increasing role in addressing financial stability risks.",
        "Greater emphasis should be placed on additional policies to resolve the structural household debt problem.",
        "Such polices included restructuring existing debt, standardizing DSR calculation, and establishing guidelines on responsible lending practice for financial institutions.",
        "The Committee would also consider approaches in addressing systemic risks posed by large corporates as well as direct a study of additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding the necessity of the policy rate cut to 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that more accommodative monetary policy would foster the continuation of economic growth and the return of headline inflation to target in the context of heightened uncertainties mainly from external factors.",
        "This would give both public and private sectors time to adjust to the economic downturn.",
        "The adjustments included restructuring household debt and preserving business competitiveness.",
        "Meanwhile, public expenditure might not provide sufficient momentum for the economy due to budget disbursement constraints and the delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E.",
        "Moreover, most Committee members viewed that the policy rate cut at this meeting would reduce pressure on the Thai baht to some extent.",
        "The cut could also reduce the need for large policy rate cuts in the future, were the Thai economy to slow down more than expected due to the global economy.",
        "On the other hand, two Committee members viewed that such a policy rate cut given the already accommodative monetary policy stance might not lend additional support to economic growth, compared with potentially increased financial stability risks.",
        "The effects of the policy rate cut would be limited in offsetting negative impacts from external factors.",
        "Moreover, interest rates were not seen to be significant constraints for current private investment, and there was a need to build up policy space to cushion against possible risks in the future.",
        "In the discussion of monetary policy outlook the Committee would monitor the developments of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially the impacts of trade protectionism, as inputs for the formulation of appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy coordination between related public and private organizations to support growth recovery and economic restructuring given structural problems facing the Thai economy that could affect competitiveness and growth outlook going forward.",
        "The problems should be firmly addressed by all related parties.",
        "Somchai Jitsuchon Trading partner economies would continue to slow down due to the impacts of uncertainties arising from international trade tensions despite some signs of improvement in the short term.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to moderate due to exports, production, and investment.",
        "Meanwhile, the services industry would remain a key sector supporting the economy.",
        "Private consumption would be supported by rising wages and tightening labor markets.",
        "China would expand at a slower pace, prompting the authorities to launch monetary and fiscal stimulus measures to help shore up the economy.",
        "While these measures were in a smaller scale than those in the past, they were designed to be more targeted and taken into account financial stability consideration.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would also moderate in line with production, exports, and a prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle.",
        "In coordination with monetary policy, fiscal policy would support Asian economies by increasingly focusing on infrastructure investment.",
        "Monetary policy of trading partners in both advanced and regional economies would loosen further.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) additionally cut its policy rate in October 2019 as insurance against potential adverse impacts on the economic and inflation outlook from uncertainties pertaining to the global economy and trade tensions.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) kept their accommodative monetary policy stance and would start its new Asset Purchase Program (APP) in November 2019.",
        "Many regional central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bank of Korea, Bank Indonesia, and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut policy rates further in October.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a probability of trading partner economies and global trade volume growing at a slower pace than the baseline projection due to (1) the global economic slowdown, (2) potentially prolonged trade protectionism through both tariff and nontariff measures that would impinge on services sector employment in advanced economies, and economies would not show a clear sign of improvement next year, although the global economy would gain traction due to the economic recovery in Latin America and Russia, as both were not Thailand’s major trading partners.",
        "Monetary policy space in various countries would be more limited.",
        "Policy rates would be lower for longer.",
        "However, there were still policy space for fiscal policy, especially in Asia, which would be an important tool for stimulating the economy in the period ahead.",
        "Moreover, risks of global financial stability would heighten in the medium to long term due to the lower for longer environment caused by accommodative monetary policy of advanced economies.",
        "Investors would search for higher yields by investing in riskier assets, which could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "There was higher risk accumulation in non-bank financial institutions due to less regulation.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor and (3) risks pertaining to economy and financial stability in order to assess their impacts on the Thai economy that could occur through various macroeconomic linkages.",
        "Concerns in the global financial markets abated thanks to positive progress on trade negotiations between the US and China in the first stage of the partial US-China trade agreement.",
        "The deal included (1) postponement of US tariff hikes on some Chinese products, imports of some agricultural products from the US.",
        "In addition, Brexit negotiation made some progress after a three-month extension until 31 January 2020.",
        "Prices of most risky assets increased owing to the risk-on sentiments after the first phrase of trade deal between US and China had some progress.",
        "Long-term US government bond yields rose in tandem with global financial market conditions.",
        "However, long-term Thai government bond yields only slightly increased due to domestic investors’ demand for long-term bonds.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht appreciated against the US dollar since the previous meeting in line with regional currencies and emerging market risky asset prices.",
        "Movements of the baht somewhat diverged from those of the yen and gold prices due to risk-on sentiments following better prospects in trade negotiations between the US and China as well as Brexit negotiation.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated since the previous meeting.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due to various factors, including uncertainties pertaining to trade negotiations between the US and China, Brexit, and the global economic slowdown.",
        "These factors could cause volatilities in asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "Moreover, monetary policy stance of advanced economies would be an important factor affecting confidence in global financial markets going forward.",
        "The Committee remained concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies given the economy continued to slow down, as heightened external uncertainties could cause the Thai economy to be more sensitive to greater currency appreciation.",
        "This would be an additional pressure on the softening employment and domestic demand, particularly in export-related manufacturing and services sectors.",
        "The Committee supported the Bank of Thailand in relaxing regulations in order to facilitate capital outflows and help promote balanced cross-border flows, which could lessen pressure on the baht as well as facilitate foreign exchange risk management of the private sector.",
        "In addition the Committee saw the flows, and impacts on the economy through various channels and (2) to review the effectiveness of the implemented capital outflow relaxation measures every three months and consider implementing additional measures at an appropriate timing if necessary.",
        "These collaboration with other private and public organizations, particularly efforts to stimulate investment to reduce the large current account surplus.",
        "Such investment projects, including those requiring imported capital goods, would help boost the economy during the global economic slowdown.",
        "These investment projects would also enhance growth potential of the Thai economy and restructure the economy to keep up with changes especially in digital technology.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previous projection and further below its potential due to the contraction in merchandise exports that increasingly affected the labor market.",
        "Merchandise exports would contract more significantly and would recover at a slower pace than the previous assessment due to (1) the slowdown in trading partner economies and global trade as a result of trade tensions and (2) indirect impacts of increasing Chinese merchandise exports redirected to the region.",
        "Exports of services would moderate.",
        "Tourism expenditure declined following the global economic slowdown.",
        "Private consumption was expected to slow down despite supports from fiscal stimulus.",
        "This was due to moderated household income and a sharp fall in employment, particularly in export-related manufacturing sectors, as well as elevated household debt.",
        "Looking ahead, private consumption would encounter downward risks regarding a broad-based decline in nonagricultural employment and a decline in agricultural output due to the low dam water levels.",
        "Private investment would grow at a lower rate than previously assessed in tandem with merchandise exports and domestic demand.",
        "However, greater clarity of public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment and the relocation of production base to Thailand would support investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure would expand at a lower rate than the previous assessment due partly to delay in the state-owned enterprise investment projects and a reduction in state-owned enterprise investment budgets for fiscal year 2020.",
        "The Committee assessed that there remained possibilities that the Thai economy could expand at a slower pace.",
        "These included key merchandise exports such as (1) automotive and auto parts that would be affected by the global economic slowdown and within-industry changes such as automation as well as a growing trend of electronic vehicle with less parts needed, causing lower demand for workers and (2) electronic goods that would face with a slower-than-expected recovery of the global electronic cycle.",
        "Moreover, some Thai entrepreneurs might gain less benefit from the upcycle due to technological changes.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, the Committee concerned over the fast decline in employment in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in a broad-based manner that would continue to decline further following the slowdown in the economic outlook and impacts of drought next year.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor developments in the labor market and debt servicing capability of households.",
        "The annual averages of headline inflation in 2019 and 2020 were projected to be lower than the previous projection and below the lower bound of the inflation target due to lower- than-expected energy prices in tandem with the global economic slowdown as well as a sooner-than-expected return to the normal level of crude oil production in Saudi Arabia after the attack on production plants.",
        "Core inflation was expected to increase at a lower rate than expected owing to processed food prices, where the pass-through of fresh food prices to processed food prices was limited.",
        "This partly reflected low demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, long-term inflation expectations slightly increased from the previous period, while short-term inflation expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "Financial system risks still posed vulnerabilities to financial stability.",
        "The financial cycle that remained above trend could reflect some vulnerabilities.",
        "However, the financial cycle was expected to moderate in the period ahead.",
        "On leverage, loan quality of SMEs continued to deteriorate.",
        "This was attributed to the worsening loan quality of medium-sized SMEs in addition to that of small-sized SMEs which were highly vulnerable owing to existing structural problems.",
        "Meanwhile, loan quality of some corporates affected by trade tensions also worsened.",
        "Regarding household debt, the household debt-to-GDP ratio remained elevated and would continue to edge up as a result of the economic slowdown as well as loan expansion by commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions, especially credit card and personal loans.",
        "Households increasingly resorted to collateralized personal loans for liquidity, part of which could be for business purposes.",
        "In addition, the share of households sensitive to negative income shocks increased, and the Committee would thus monitor these households during the economic downturn.",
        "In order to curb household debt problems going responsible lending and standardize debt service ratio (DSR) calculation in order to collate DSR data in case additional measures intended to curb household debt would become necessary in the future.",
        "Search-for-yield behavior that led to underpricing of risks still persisted in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "Large corporates increasingly turned to the bond market for funds instead of commercial banks during the low interest rate environment, with banks becoming cautious in extending loans.",
        "Some high-yield bonds and perpetual bonds were found to be bought by individuals who might underprice risks.",
        "Growth of saving cooperative assets subsided following moderation in deposits and their members’ equities.",
        "Regarding the property sector, after the implementation of the revised loan-to- value (LTV) measure, households and commercial banks changed their behavior as intended.",
        "Speculation abated as reflected in (1) the slower growth of new condominium loans for the second and subsequent contracts, (2) the tightened credit underwriting standards, and (3) the decline in condominium prices due to softened demand.",
        "Prices of single houses and townhouses were largely unchanged.",
        "Property developers adjusted by delaying new project launches.",
        "Meanwhile, the government’s reduction of transfer fees and mortgage registration fees to 0.01 percent for new housing units under three million baht effective 2 November The Committee viewed that the macroprudential measures previously implemented helped curb vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent.",
        "The Committee saw a need to continuously monitor and assess the impacts of LTV measure on the property sector.",
        "There also was a need to monitor financing by large corporates that might underprice risks and risks associated with large saving cooperatives that were highly financially interconnected.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that household debt was a critical and urgent structural risk that would require a multi-dimensional resolution.",
        "Cooperation between various parties was needed to reduce leverage and to restructure existing debt.",
        "In this light, greater emphasis should be placed on borrowers’ debt servicing capability.",
        "The Committee thus directed a study of additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and further below its potential due to the contraction in merchandise exports that increasingly affected employment and domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative.",
        "Real interest rates and government bond yields remained low.",
        "Liquidity in the financial system remained ample.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht continued to appreciate.",
        "Financial stability had already been taken care of to some extent, but there remained pockets of risks that warranted continued monitoring.",
        "Most Committee members judged that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target.",
        "The Committee therefore voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.50 to 1.25 percent.",
        "Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent.",
        "The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and further below its potential.",
        "Merchandise exports contracted more than the previous assessment and were projected to recover at a slower pace.",
        "Employment would decline significantly in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.",
        "Public expenditure would grow at a lower rate than previously estimated.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter higher risks from both external and internal factors including (1) uncertain trade tensions and prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle, (2) the weakening outlook of trading partners’ economies, especially China and Asia, together with intensifying geopolitical risks, partnership infrastructure investment and the consequent impact on private investment, and income, and (6) risks from drought next year which could affect agricultural output and farm income.",
        "The Committee assessed that continued exchange rate appreciation affected exports and the overall economy.",
        "The impacts could be seen from business profits and liquidity, a sharp reduction in employment in export-related manufacturing sectors, signs of slowdown in domestic demand and deteriorated debt servicing capability in the sectors related to export contraction.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor exchange rate and its impacts on the economy.",
        "2) Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target in 2019 and 2020 due to lower-than-expected energy prices in line with the global economic slowdown and with quicker-than-expected recovery in Saudi Arabia oil production.",
        "In addition, core inflation was expected to be lower than the previous estimate owing to subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "In the period ahead, the Committee viewed that inflation projection would face uncertainties from oil price fluctuations and weather conditions.",
        "Moreover, structural changes such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "3) Some financial system risks which had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.",
        "For instance, property sector risks abated after the implementation of the loan-to-value (LTV) measure.",
        "Moreover, banks were more cautious in extending loans during the economic slowdown.",
        "However, other financial stability risks had not improved and warranted continued monitoring.",
        "First, debt servicing capability of households and SMEs could be worsened amid economic slowdown, particularly in the case of additional income shocks, while elevated household debt could build up vulnerabilities in the household sector.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks, especially by large corporates and saving cooperatives.",
        "Third, the property sector remained oversupplied in some areas.",
        "Given the softening economic outlook and prolonged low interest rates, the Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures would need to play an increasing role in addressing financial stability risks.",
        "The Committee supported the Bank of Thailand to work with other organizations in order to push forward household and SME debt resolutions.",
        "Such resolutions included debt restructuring and the debt clinic, together with putting into practice guidelines for responsible lending and for building financial discipline and promoting household savings.",
        "The Committee saw a need to continue monitoring impacts of the implemented measures and study additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding the necessity of the policy rate cut to 1.25 percent at this meeting.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that more accommodative monetary policy would support economic growth during the slowdown as well as the rise of headline inflation toward target in the context of heightened uncertainties mainly from external factors.",
        "This would give both public and private sectors time to adjust to the economic downturn.",
        "The adjustments included restructuring household and corporate debt such as debt to enhance their debt servicing capability as well as to keep their businesses operating.",
        "Moreover, the policy rate cut could also facilitate fiscal policy to support the economy.",
        "In addition, most Committee members viewed that the policy rate cut together with the relaxation of capital outflow regulations would reduce pressure on the baht to some extent.",
        "Nevertheless, two Committee members viewed that a policy rate cut given the already accommodative monetary policy stance might not lend additional support to economic growth compared with potentially increased financial stability risks, which could pose adverse effect on economic growth in the long run.",
        "In addition, the effect of a policy rate cut on reducing pressure on the baht could be limited as baht appreciation was driven mainly by inflows from current account surplus and foreign direct investment.",
        "Furthermore, there remained a need to preserve the limited policy space for coping with potentially heightened risks in the future.",
        "In the discussion of the monetary policy outlook the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the developments of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy coordination between related public and private organizations to support growth recovery and economic restructuring given structural problems facing the Thai economy that could affect competitiveness and growth outlook going forward.",
        "The problems should be firmly addressed by all related parties.",
        "Somchai Jitsuchon Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace, particularly advanced economies, as economic and political uncertainties affected private sector confidence and economic activities.",
        "The US economy was temporarily affected by the extended government shutdown.",
        "However, the US would continue to grow with support from a strong labor market in the period ahead.",
        "Chinese and Asian economies would expand at a slower pace after exports accelerated in the earlier period due to concerns over trade protectionism measures between the US and China.",
        "The Chinese economy showed some signs of weakening domestic demand.",
        "The overall monetary policy of trading partners would be less tightening.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) was expected to delay its next policy rate hike to the third quarter of 2019.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) would raise its policy rate at the earliest possible period in the second half of 2019.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was expected to continue its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Other regional central banks were also expected to keep their monetary policy stance unchanged.",
        "Nevertheless, Bank Indonesia (BI) would likely further hike the policy rate in 2019 to preserve external stability.",
        "The Committee viewed that trading partner economies would probably grow slower than previously assessed due to the US government shutdown, uncertainties regarding Brexit negotiations, and possibly prolonged trade tensions between the US and China despite easing temporarily.",
        "There remained risks surrounding the Chinese economy and financial stability, notwithstanding government measures to support growth including tax reduction for businesses and households, a lower reserve requirement ratio, and some financial stability measures to curb debt in the economy recently.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor developments of these factors through qualitative data, such as business and consumer confidence surveys, in conjunction with quantitative data, such as labor market information, to assess the momentum of trading partner economies in the period ahead.",
        "Concerns in the global financial markets temporarily abated after the Fed communicated a more gradual policy rate normalization.",
        "Meanwhile, investor concerns over trade protectionism measures between the US and China subsided.",
        "Risks of a no-deal Brexit also declined.",
        "Foreign investors consequently increased their portfolio investment in stock - 2 markets of emerging market economies.",
        "Nevertheless, Thailand registered net outflows of foreign portfolio investment since the beginning of this year as the Thai bond market experienced net sell-off by foreign investors.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht strengthened against the US dollar mainly due to the weakened US dollar.",
        "The movement of the Thai baht was in line with those of emerging markets and regional currencies.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) index appreciated due to Thailand’s strong external stability, which was partly reflected by the sustained current account surplus.",
        "Despite a decline in global financial market volatility in the near term, uncertainties would remain going forward, especially those related to the global growth slowdown and the impact of trade protectionism measures between the US and China.",
        "The Committee viewed that global financial markets would remain highly uncertain in the period ahead due primarily to (1) monetary policy direction of advanced economies, situation in the euro zone that could intensify and affect the global economy and crossborder capital flows, in turn exerting pressures on asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial markets and exchange rates, as well as their impacts on the Thai economy.",
        "The Thai economy was expected to continue gaining traction on the back of domestic demand despite a slowdown in external demand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports would expand at a slower pace due to the global trade slowdown, trade protectionism measures between the US and China that affected trading partner economies, and the down cycle of electronic products.",
        "Going forward, the value of merchandise exports was expected to grow at a slower pace but would later accelerate during the second half of 2019 partly owing to redirected orders of some industries from China to Thailand.",
        "Moreover, the European Union delisted Thailand from the illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) yellow-card status, which would support an increase in fishery exports.",
        "Exports of services were expected to improve particularly on the back of the recovery in Chinese tourist figures whose growth turned positive for the first time in December 2018 after the tour boat sinking incident in Phuket last year.",
        "The recovery in the number of Chinese tourists was faster than expected due partly to the extension of the visa on arrival fee waiver until the end of April 2019.",
        "However, tourism receipts would improve slightly as, after the Phuket incident, businesses offered discount packages to attract tourists.",
        "Private consumption was expected to continue expanding across all product categories due to various factors, including (1) improvement in incomes of both agricultural and non-agricultural households and (2) a more broad-based increase in household incomes across income groups and regions due in part to additional supports from government measures.",
        "Nevertheless, elevated household debt would still weigh on private consumption.",
        "Private investment was expected to expand thanks to public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure investment projects and the relocation of production base in some industries to Thailand.",
        "Public expenditure was projected to expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to undertake project reviews to comply with the master plans under the National Strategy, - 3 The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding the outlook for the Thai economy in the face of external and domestic uncertainties.",
        "Over the recent period, the Thai economy continued to expand on the back of domestic demand, especially private consumption that was continually driven by an improvement in the labor market across almost all sectors, together with a gradual, more broad-based increase in household income.",
        "However, elevated household debt would be a drag on private consumption going forward.",
        "Moreover, durable consumption was expected to grow at a slower pace— in particular, spending on automobiles that had earlier accelerated, as going forward financial institutions would likely tighten credit standards for auto-leasing loans due to deteriorating loan quality.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor the strength of private consumption.",
        "Private investment continued to expand.",
        "However, the Committee saw a need to closely monitor progress on major infrastructure investment projects that could affect the momentum of private investment, especially given uncertainties that might arise after the formation of the new government.",
        "Meanwhile, risks to the exports of goods tilted to the downside due to trade protectionism measures between the US and China that would be prolonged despite easing in the near term.",
        "In addition, although the situation of air pollution exceeding a safe level at present had yet to show a clear impact, this could affect tourism going forward if unresolved.",
        "In the period ahead, risks to headline inflation tilted to the downside due to fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was expected to rise slowly due to gradual improvement in demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nonetheless, structural changes partly contributed to a more persistent inflation than in the past.",
        "Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production.",
        "Some pockets of risks in the financial system might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "With regard to leverage, the seasonally-adjusted household debt to GDP ratio slightly increased in the third quarter of 2018.",
        "The seasonally-adjusted private nonfinancial corporate debt-to-GDP ratio edged up somewhat due to borrowing of property and hotel businesses.",
        "Regarding loan quality, the Committee would monitor the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio of mortgage loans that remained at a high level, while the NPL ratio of auto-leasing loans was expected to rise.",
        "With regard to asset prices, recent volatilities of the SET index decreased in tandem with global financial markets.",
        "The priceearnings ratio (P/E ratio) remained slightly lower than the historical average.",
        "Borrowing costs of corporates in the bond market for certain credit-rating groups continued to increase.",
        "The Committee hence would monitor debt rollovers, particularly in the case of companies issuing bonds with low credit rating or unrated bonds that were mostly in the real estate sector.",
        "With regard to the property sector, demand for real estate, particularly foreign demand, continued to expand.",
        "Meanwhile, developers continuously raised funds through commercial bank loans and corporate bonds.",
        "Regarding mortgage loans, the share of new mortgage loans with high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios was still rising.",
        "Moreover, the debt-to-service ratio (DSR) of low-income households was at a high level.",
        "The search-for- yield behavior remained present in the prolonged low interest rate environment, as reflected in the high growth in equity investment of saving cooperatives, together with certain large saving cooperatives increasingly mobilizing deposits and in turn lending to other cooperatives.",
        "This increased interdependence posed further build-up of risks within - 4 the cooperatives system.",
        "Meanwhile, investment in mutual funds grew at a slower pace, which was in part due to a decline in fixed income funds since the previous year.",
        "The Committee would pay close attention to the interconnectedness of individual risks, focusing on an integrated and forward-looking risk assessment in order to address and prevent financial imbalances, which included elevated household debts, property sector risks, the expansion of saving cooperatives’ assets, and acceleration in borrowing by large corporates that might underprice risks.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain traction on the back of domestic demand despite a slowdown in external demand.",
        "Headline inflation was restrained by lower energy prices, while downside risks increased from fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Core inflation edged up in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "However, there were risks to financial stability in the future that warranted close monitoring.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that current accommodative monetary policy stance had contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target.",
        "Most Committee members also judged that pockets of financial stability risks had been addressed to a certain extent by the implemented macroprudential measures and the policy rate hike in the previous meeting.",
        "Thus, most members voted to keep the policy rate unchanged.",
        "Meanwhile, two Committee members assessed that the economy continued to expand at the level around its potential, and that the overall financial conditions would remain accommodative and conducive to economic growth despite an additional 0.25 percentage point increase in the policy rate.",
        "Moreover, increasing the policy rate would reduce financial stability risks and help to build up policy space.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "1) The Thai economy continued to gain traction.",
        "Despite a moderating growth in merchandise exports attributable to global trade slowdown and the impact of trade protectionism measures between the US and China, service exports improved in line with the faster-than-expected recovery in the number of Chinese tourists.",
        "Domestic demand continued to increase, particularly on account of private consumption which was driven by increasingly broad-based improvement in farm and non-farm incomes as well as additional supports from government measures.",
        "Private investment was expected to expand due to the relocation of production base to Thailand, PPP infrastructure investment projects, and foreign direct investment in some industries.",
        "Nonetheless, public expenditure expanded at a lower rate than the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee viewed that the economy would continue to expand at the level around its potential, but would experience increased uncertainties from external and domestic factors that could affect economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "These uncertainties included in particular (1) trade protectionism measures between the US and China that could be prolonged and affect trading partner economies and consequently Thailand’s merchandise exports, (2) a worsening outlook for Chinese economic growth, and (3) the progress on - 5 infrastructure investment projects that could have important consequence for private investment.",
        "2) Headline inflation was restrained by lower energy prices.",
        "Moreover, downside risks increased owing to fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor factors that could affect crude oil prices, including those relating to the financial markets and oil supply, particularly from the Middle Eastern countries.",
        "The Committee would also closely monitor factors that could increase fresh food prices, such as increasing external demand due to livestock diseases abroad and the delisting of Thailand from the IUU list.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation edged up due to a gradual increase in demandpull inflationary pressure and improving economic conditions.",
        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy had allowed headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes such as the impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs all could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past despite the continued expansion of the Thai economy.",
        "3) There were pockets of risks in the financial system that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "First, household leverage increased, particularly from auto- leasing and personal loans, while credit quality of mortgage loans and auto-leasing loans continued to decline due in part to more relaxed credit underwriting standards.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "For example, the assets of saving cooperatives continued to grow.",
        "Large saving cooperatives also played a greater role in the cooperatives system by extending more loans to other saving cooperatives.",
        "Meanwhile, large corporates accelerated their fundraising in the prolonged low interest rate environment, representing a larger share of the bond market and commercial bank loans.",
        "Third, risks in the real estate sector remained, including significant foreign demand for Thai properties, competition in the mortgage loan market, and the oversupply of property in some areas.",
        "Moreover, real estate developers continued to increase their funding through commercial bank loans and bonds.",
        "The Committee viewed that accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system had been addressed to some extent by the implementation of macroprudential measures as well as the policy rate hike in the previous meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would closely monitor developments in the mortgage loan market, adjustments in the property sector, growth in assets of saving cooperatives, as well as leverage by households and large corporates that might be subject to underpricing of risks.",
        "The Committee viewed that there would be a need to study the appropriate macroprudential measures for Thailand to prevent the future risk build-ups.",
        "Most Committee members agreed that the impacts of the implemented macroprudential measures and the policy rate hike needed to be monitored for a certain period.",
        "However, two Committee members assessed that a rate hike in this meeting would complement the use of macroprudential measures in order to reduce financial stability risks.",
        "The Committee discussed monetary policy transmission after the policy rate hike.",
        "The money market rates, short-term government bond yields, and deposit rates of some financial institutions began to rise in line with the policy rate.",
        "With liquidity in the banking - 6 system sufficient to support loan growth in the period ahead, most lending rates were largely unchanged.",
        "Real interest rates edged up but remained at low levels.",
        "The private sector continued to raise funds, while corporate and consumer loans expanded.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed the monetary policy outlook and judged that accommodative policy would remain appropriate in the period ahead.",
        "Policy rate increase would be gradual and follow a data-dependent approach, with a careful assessment of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace than the previous assessment despite signs of improvements, particularly in the US and China, in the short term.",
        "Advanced economies grew at a slower pace due to country-specific factors such as the gradually fading benefit of the US fiscal stimulus, the impact of Japan’s consumption tax increase in October 2019, the effect of the new emission standards on automobile production, and political uncertainties in the euro area.",
        "Furthermore, a high level of business inventory following a weakening domestic demand and exports would restrain and cause production to recover slowly.",
        "In addition, the slow increase in global trade volume could affect employment in the manufacturing sector.",
        "However, overall employment remained sound, especially in the services sector.",
        "The Chinese economy would expand at a slower pace, but the growth rate would not decline considerably owing to government measures to support growth.",
        "Investment and retail sales showed signs of improvement in the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would expand at a slower pace in line with global trade volume.",
        "The overall monetary policy of trading partners would be more accommodative both in advanced and regional economies.",
        "The Federal Reserve was expected to hold its policy rate through the end of 2019.",
        "The European Central Bank would likely pursue an accommodative monetary policy for an extended period.",
        "For regional central banks, the Reserve Bank of India and Bank Negara Malaysia lowered their policy rates.",
        "Bank Indonesia and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas were expected to cut their policy rates this year.",
        "Accommodative monetary policy and supportive fiscal measures would foster trading partner economies going forward.",
        "The Committee assessed that downside risks to trading partners’ economic growth exhibited a positive development, particularly a higher-than-expected expansion of the Chinese economy, as well as a lower risk of the no-deal Brexit.",
        "However, other risks that still warranted monitoring included the outcome of trade negotiations between the US and China, together with the US import tariffs on automobiles and parts which would have implications on Thailand’s production, employment and exports going forward.",
        "The Committee saw a need to closely monitor developments in trading partner economies together with the aforementioned risks and to assess their impacts on the Thai economy that could occur through various macroeconomic linkages.",
        "Concerns in global financial markets temporarily abated, resulting in an increase in overall prices of risky assets.",
        "This was due to (1) recent higher-than-expected economic outturns in the US and China, (2) a more accommodative stance regarding monetary policy - 2 communications of central banks in major economies and Asia, and (3) easing concerns over trade negotiations between the US and China given positive developments since the beginning of this year.",
        "In addition, positive signs in global financial markets encouraged foreign investors to invest in assets of emerging market economies (EMs), particularly those with high yields.",
        "Nevertheless, investors remained cautious to invest in Thai assets partly due to domestic political uncertainties.",
        "Thus, Thailand registered net foreign portfolio outflows from both the government bond and equity markets since the beginning of this year.",
        "Moreover, concerns in global financial markets intensified once again after the US announced plans to raise additional tariffs on imported goods from China, resulting in heightened volatility in global financial markets.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated slightly against the US dollar since the previous meeting.",
        "The movement of the Thai baht was in line with regional currencies, causing the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) to be largely unchanged.",
        "Meanwhile, corporate bond yields in secondary markets slightly declined, partly due to an increase in bond holdings by domestic investors given expectations of a more dovish hike in the policy rate.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due primarily to (1) Thailand’s political uncertainties, (2) an unsettled outcome of trade negotiations between the US and China, and (3) the global economic slowdown.",
        "These uncertainties could pressure asset prices and exchanges rates.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor domestic uncertainties, developments in global financial markets and exchange rates, as well as their impacts on the Thai economy.",
        "The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than the previous assessment mainly due to merchandise exports and investment.",
        "Merchandise exports would grow at a lower rate due to the slowdown of the global economy and global trade, as well as the impact of trade protectionist measures between the US and China.",
        "Private investment was projected to expand at a slower pace as some investors postponed their investment plans to assess clarity of government policy and the continuation of public investment projects.",
        "Nevertheless, investment in the manufacturing sector would likely expand, as reflected in growing imports of capital goods in the manufacturing machinery category.",
        "Meanwhile, public expenditure would likely grow at a slower rate than the previous assessment due to Expenditure Budget Act for fiscal year 2020 and (2) delay in some state-owned enterprise investment projects.",
        "However, the Thai economy would continue to gain traction driven by private consumption which was expected to continue expanding, supported especially by non-farm income and government measures.",
        "Nonetheless, private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt and a leveling off in overall employment, with signs of moderation seen in the construction and export-related manufacturing sectors.",
        "Exports of services would continue to expand partly attributable to the benefit from the extended exemption of the visa on arrival fee until the end of October 2019, which would offset a decline in the number of foreign tourists in some areas due to the recent air pollution problem.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussions regarding global economic and domestic uncertainties, particularly trade protectionist measures between the US and China that - 3 could intensify in the period ahead.",
        "This would affect the Thai economy in three aspects.",
        "First, the weakening of the global economy and global trade would impinge upon merchandise exports, tourism, and investment in Thailand.",
        "Second, Thai exports that were part of the supply chain of Chinese exports to the US would experience a negative impact.",
        "On the other hand, some Thai exporters would benefit by substituting Chinese products exported to the US.",
        "Third, there could be a relocation of production base of foreign businesses to ASEAN countries including Thailand.",
        "In any case, the Committee assessed that trade protectionist measures between the US and China were a significant risk and remained highly uncertain, and deemed it necessary to closely monitor developments with a more comprehensive analysis of the impacts.",
        "Furthermore, the dumping of Chinese goods to the third countries including Thailand also warranted monitoring.",
        "Regarding domestic uncertainties, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy was subject to heightened political uncertainties, which could have implications for economic growth, including a direct effect on government spending in the period ahead and an indirect effect on private consumption and investor confidence.",
        "In addition, risks from drought, which could intensify and extend to wider areas, could weigh on purchasing power of farmers and sustainability of private consumption going forward.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to remain close to the lower bound of the inflation target following a rise in energy prices in line with the outlook of global crude oil prices.",
        "This could offset a lower-than-expected increase in fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation remained broadly unchanged from the previous estimate and was expected to increase slowly on account of a gradual improvement of demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Furthermore, structural changes, such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, intensified price competition, and lower production costs from higher production efficiency, could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "Moreover, short-term inflation expectations slightly increased, while long-term inflation expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "Some pockets of risks in the financial system might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "Regarding leverage, the seasonally-adjusted household debt-to-GDP ratio slightly increased in the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "This was mainly on account of an accelerated extension of auto-related loans, both auto loans and auto refinancing (“car for cash”), by commercial banks and auto-leasing companies.",
        "Looking ahead, sustained and elevated household debt as a share of GDP could pose more sensitivity of some household groups to negative income shocks, which could weigh on debt serviceability in the future.",
        "Meanwhile, the seasonally-adjusted private non-financial corporation debt-to-GDP ratio rose somewhat due to increased borrowings from financial institutions and bond issuances.",
        "Meanwhile, the quality of household loans must be monitored, particularly auto-related loans with the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio continuing to rise.",
        "In addition, deteriorating loan quality of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially in commercial, construction and services sectors, must also be monitored.",
        "Regarding the property sector, there were some adjustments prior to the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) ratio measure, resulting in a largely stable house price index.",
        "Regarding demand for real estate, a number of new mortgage loan approvals increased for both low-rise houses and condominium.",
        "This was reflected in the rising share of (1) new mortgage loans with the LTV ratio above 90 percent and (2) loans with value exceeding collateral value.",
        "Similarly, the rising share of new mortgage loans with high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios and long repayment periods reflected an acceleration of - 4 ownership transfers before the implementation of revised LTV measure.",
        "On the supply side, the revised LTV measure moderated overall property sales.",
        "Real estate developers thus launched sales promotion for completed condominium projects as well as delayed opening new projects.",
        "However, there was a need to monitor foreign property demand that might continue to decline following the global economic slowdown and domestic uncertainties.",
        "The search-for-yield behavior remained present in the prolonged low interest rate environment, as reflected in the continued expansion of investment in risky assets of households, both mutual funds and saving cooperatives.",
        "Despite a stabilizing growth of mutual funds overall, foreign investment funds (FIF) continued to grow and were concentrated in certain countries.",
        "Meanwhile, despite some slowdown in the investment of saving cooperatives, there was an increase in the interconnectedness within the system of saving cooperatives.",
        "This was particularly the case for large saving cooperatives that engaged in an intermediary role by taking deposits and lending to other cooperatives.",
        "Such behavior reflected that households might underprice risks.",
        "Looking ahead, if deficit saving cooperatives were to face credit risk given high NPLs, this could subsequently trigger capital losses to large and surplus saving cooperatives in the future.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussions regarding measures to address and prevent pockets of risks that could pose vulnerability to financial stability.",
        "These risks included, in particular, elevated household debt, growing assets and greater interconnectedness within the system of saving cooperatives, adjustments of risks in the property sector after the implementation of the revised LTV measure, as well as leverage by large corporates that might underprice risks.",
        "In the following period, the Committee viewed that there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools.",
        "These included (1) the appropriate policy interest rate, (2) microprudential measures such as strengthening credit standards of financial institutions, and (3) macroprudential measures which should place greater emphasis on debt serviceability of borrowers.",
        "There were also additional measures including facilitating debt settlement of unsecured personal loans under specified conditions (“debt clinic”), enhancing financial literacy and discipline of the public, as well as supporting relevant supervisory authorities to push forward the implementation of an upgraded supervisory standard for saving cooperatives in accordance with the Cooperatives Act (No.3) B.E.",
        "2562 in order to ensure stability of the cooperatives system.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower pace than previously assessed owing to merchandise exports and investment, while domestic consumption was expected to continue expanding.",
        "Inflation was projected to be consistent with the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "However, there were risks to financial stability that warranted close monitoring.",
        "In addition, global economic and domestic uncertainties would remain high in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee therefore unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting in order to assess the clarity of impacts from such uncertainties.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "- 5 1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than the previous assessment owing to merchandise exports and investment.",
        "Merchandise exports would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to the global economic slowdown, a down cycle of electronic products, as well as impacts from trade protectionist measures between the US and China.",
        "Private investment was expected to expand at a slower pace, as some investors delayed their investment in order to assess (1) clarity pertaining to policy prospects after the formation of the new government and (2) the continuation of public investment projects.",
        "Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed, partly due to delay in public investment projects.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption was expected to continue expanding but was restrained by elevated household debt and employment in construction as well as manufacturing sectors that started to moderate.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would experience increased global economic and domestic uncertainties that could affect economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "These uncertainties included, in particular, (1) trade protectionist measures between the US and China that could intensify and subsequently affect trading partner economies and Thailand’s merchandise exports, as well as the outlook of major advanced economies and China which could impinge on domestic demand, (2) political uncertainties that could affect investment in significant infrastructure projects and could have knock-on effects on private investment, lead to a larger-than-expected impact on private consumption.",
        "2) There were pockets of risks in the financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "First, household leverages increased, driven particularly by auto-related loans, both auto loans and car for cash.",
        "Meanwhile, the NPLs of auto loans continued to rise, partly as a result of more lenient credit underwriting standards in the previous periods led by increased competition from non-bank financial institutions.",
        "Moreover, deteriorating debt serviceability of SMEs must be monitored.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks, particularly of which related to the cooperatives system and leverage by large corporates.",
        "Third, risks in the real estate sector remained, especially an oversupply of property in some areas.",
        "The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures in the previous period helped curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent.",
        "However, an appropriate level of the policy interest rate would still be necessary to preserve financial stability in the period ahead.",
        "Implemented macroprudential and microprudential measures could only address risks associated with some categories of loans also be effective only for new loans.",
        "Therefore, the Committee deemed it necessary to continue monitoring the impacts of the implemented macroprudential measures and to examine further appropriate macroprudential measures to prevent systemic risks more 3) Headline inflation was projected to be consistent with the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "The increase in energy prices since the previous meeting could offset a lower-than- expected increase in fresh food prices.",
        "Nevertheless, there remained upside risks to fresh - 6 food prices in the period ahead due to drought.",
        "The Committee would thus monitor factors that could affect crude oil and fresh food prices, particularly a potentially intensified drought.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation would remain broadly unchanged from the previous projection.",
        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy allowed headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes, such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs, could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "At this meeting, the Committee discussed a framework for incorporating financial stability consideration in monetary policy formulation.",
        "The Committee saw the need to develop comprehensive financial stability indicators, including a financial cycle indicator that was related to downside risks to medium-term economic growth.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that it was necessary to analyze and assess risks to financial stability in various dimensions, including the interconnectedness in the financial system, forward-looking assessment and scenario planning, as well as analysis on buffer capacity in each sector.",
        "In this light, the Committee deemed it necessary for the staff to continue developing indicators and an analytical framework in order to support monetary policy formulation in a more systematic manner going forward.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed monetary policy outlook and judged that, for the current meeting, the Committee would need to wait and assess the clarity of various factors due to heightened global economic and domestic uncertainties.",
        "Therefore, current accommodative policy would remain appropriate.",
        "Going forward, further policy rate adjustment would be gradual and follow a data-dependent approach, with a careful assessment of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to grow at a slower pace in line with exports, production, and investment that were affected by escalating international trade tensions.",
        "Private consumption would remain an important growth driver thanks to employment in the services sector.",
        "China would also grow at a slower pace, held down mainly by exports as a result of intensifying trade tensions.",
        "However, the Chinese government announced additional monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, which would help shore up the Chinese economy.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would grow moderately in tandem with production, exports, and a prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle.",
        "Overall monetary policy of trading partners in both advanced and regional economies would be more accommodative.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) reduced its policy rate in September 2019, and another policy rate cut was expected within this year.",
        "The policy rate reduction was regarded as an insurance against potential impacts on the economic and inflation outlook from uncertainties in the global economy and international trade tensions.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of monetary easing measures in September.",
        "The package included a key interest rate cut, a new round of the Asset Purchasing Program (APP), and an extended liquidity injection into the financial system through the third Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III).",
        "Some regional central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and Bank Indonesia additionally cut their policy rates.",
        "Meanwhile, other regional central banks still held their policy rates with tendency to cut by the end of this year.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a higher probability of trading partners’ economic growth being lower than the baseline projection due especially to (1) economic slowdown and trade tensions that could be prolonged and intensified and thus would affect employment in the services sector in advanced economies and (2) a potential no-deal Brexit and geopolitical risks in some countries.",
        "The Committee also noted that most of fiscal stimulus measures in advanced economies and China were mainly for supporting domestic demand.",
        "Therefore, these measures could contribute limitedly to the global economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor (1) developments in global demand and trading partner economies together with the aforementioned risks in order to assess their impacts on the Thai economy through various linkages and (2) other countries’ monetary policy stances that could have implications on capital flows and the Thai baht.",
        "The global financial markets became volatile in tandem with developments of trade tensions between the US and China, Brexit, and geopolitical risks.",
        "Safe-haven asset prices increased in August in line with rising volatility in the global financial markets due to risk-off sentiments after the US and China announced additional retaliatory tariff and non-tariff measures.",
        "Meanwhile, the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit heightened.",
        "However, trade tensions and the no-deal Brexit risk somewhat abated in September due to (1) delays in new tariff hikes between the US and China and (2) better prospects of a Brexit extension.",
        "In addition, continuation of more accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies positively contributed to risk-on sentiment for investors to reinvest in risky assets, resulting in a gradual increase in risky asset prices.",
        "Regarding domestic financial markets, the policy rate cut in the previous meeting contributed to a decrease in short-term Thai government bond yields.",
        "Meanwhile, long-term Thai government bond yields quickly declined in line with the US counterpart in tandem with the global financial markets conditions.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht appreciated against the US dollar since the previous meeting despite baht depreciation in August after the policy rate cut.",
        "The movement of the baht was mainly driven by factors pertaining to global financial markets, especially after the US and China announced new tariff hikes.",
        "As a result, the baht appreciated in line with the Japanese yen and gold prices, which were safe-haven assets.",
        "In September, the baht continued to appreciate in line with risky asset prices of emerging markets economies.",
        "This was a result of improvement in trade negotiations between the US and China as well as Brexit negotiations.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial market would remain highly uncertain going forward due to various factors, including prolonged trade tensions, Brexit negotiations, and the global economic slowdown.",
        "These factors could cause volatility in asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "Moreover, monetary policy stance of advanced economies would be an important factor affecting confidence in the global financial markets going forward.",
        "The Committee remained concerned about baht appreciation against trading partner currencies given the economic slowdown prospects, as the economy could be more sensitive to greater currency appreciation.",
        "This would be an additional pressure on the softening domestic demand, particularly exportedrelated manufacturing and services sectors.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor developments of exchange rates, capital flows, and impacts on the economy through various channels, as well as consider implementing additional measures at an appropriate authority, such as continued relaxation of capital outflow regulations to encourage Thai residents to increase their portfolio investment abroad, and (2) those required collaboration with other organizations, including efforts to stimulate investment to reduce the elevated current account surplus.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than the previous projection and below its potential.",
        "The slowdown was due to contracted merchandise exports that started to affect domestic demand.",
        "Exports of goods were expected to contract more than the previous assessment because of the slowdown in trading partner economies and global trade due to intensifying trade tensions and a prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle.",
        "Exports of services would slow down consistent with the global economy.",
        "Private consumption was weighed down by (1) a decline in household income and employment in various industries, especially in export-related manufacturing sectors and in the agricultural sector partly hit by natural disasters and (2) elevated household debt.",
        "Nevertheless, government stimulus measures would support private consumption this year to expand as previously assessed.",
        "Private investment would grow at a lower rate than the previous assessment, partly owing to exports contraction and weakening domestic demand.",
        "However, the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure would grow moderately due partly to delay in the state-owned enterprise investment projects.",
        "However, government consumption would increase due to the budget restructure with an increase in the share of current expenditure for fiscal year 2020.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy in 2019 and 2020 to expand at a lower rate than estimated in June 2019 mainly due to merchandise exports contraction which started to affect domestic demand.",
        "The economic growth was projected to be 2.8 percent in 2019 and would increase to 3.3 percent in 2020, which was lower than the previous projection at 3.3 and 3.7 percent, respectively.",
        "Risks to the economic projection were slightly tilted more to the downside due to the following factors.",
        "First, lower-than-expected trading partners’ economic growth owing to various uncertainties could affect Thai merchandise exports.",
        "These uncertainties included further intensified trade tensions and their impacts on global trade volume, a longer downturn in electronic cycle, Brexit negotiations, and geopolitical risks in some countries.",
        "Second, domestic demand could be lower than expected owing to uncertainties pertaining to government policy implementation, delays in public‐private partnerships infrastructure investment projects, and a further weakening of household purchasing power following worsening impacts on employment in export-related sectors as well as from natural disasters.",
        "Nevertheless, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a higher rate than the baseline projection owing to (1) higher-than- expected trading partners’ economic growth in case of additional stimulus policies or alleviated trade tensions in the period ahead resulting in a faster-than-expected recovery of the electronic cycle and (2) higher-than-expected domestic demand in case of faster-thanexpected developments in infrastructure investment projects and private investment, including the case of additional fiscal stimulus measures.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the economic outlook and its implications for the appropriate policy mix going forward.",
        "The Committee noted that domestic demand would be affected by (1) uncertainties pertaining to approval and implementation of key public-private infrastructure investment projects and (2) elevated household debt and declining household employment and income that could affect consumption prospects.",
        "The Committee viewed that comprehensive understanding of different characteristics among households, such as those with different financial positions, those with high debt and fragilities, and those without financial disciplines, were needed to design targeted and appropriate solutions to the household debt problem.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation in 2019 was projected to be lower than the previous projection and below the lower bound of the inflation target due to (1) lower-than- expected energy prices owing to the global economic slowdown despite a transient increase in crude oil price following the attacks of oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and (2) the annual average of core inflation in 2019 would decline owing to prices of processed food, housing rent, and personal care products, partly reflecting subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nonetheless, the annual average of headline inflation in 2020 was expected to return to the target in line with gradual economic recovery and prospects of minimum wage increases.",
        "The Committee thus revised down projection of headline inflation in 2019 from remain a likelihood of headline and core inflation being lower than the baseline projection in line with risks to the economic projection.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously projected due to contraction in exports that affected domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation in conditions remained accommodative.",
        "Financial stability had already been taken care of to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted continued monitoring.",
        "The Committee viewed that developments of the economic outlook, inflation, and financial stability remained close to the assessment in the previous meeting.",
        "Moreover, accommodative monetary policy stance since the policy rate cut in August would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target in 2020.",
        "The Committee therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously projected and below its potential due to (1) the contraction in merchandise exports in line with the slowdown in trading partner economies and global trade volume as a result of intensifying trade tensions and (2) a prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, private consumption would slow down despite supports from fiscal stimulus measures.",
        "This was due to manufacturing sectors and employment that were affected by contraction in exports, natural disasters, and elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment would be moderating in line with exports.",
        "However, the relocation of production base to Thailand as well as public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would contribute to the momentum in the period ahead.",
        "Public expenditure would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due partly to delay in state-owned enterprise investment projects.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter heightened uncertainties mainly from the external front that could affect the growth prospects going forward.",
        "These uncertainties included, in particular, (1) trade tensions that could be prolonged and expanded, demand as well as the increased likelihood of no-deal Brexit and heightened geopolitical risks, and (3) monetary policy stance of advanced economy and regional central banks that could continue to be more accommodative.",
        "In addition, the Committee would still monitor policy implementation by the government, such as impacts of fiscal stimulus measures and minimum wage increase policy, together with the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment that could affect the growth outlook in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee assessed that sustained exchange rate appreciation could result in greater effects on exports and the overall economy amid the slowdown in trading partner economies and increased international competition.",
        "Signs of impacts on profits and liquidity, debt servicing capability, and reduction of overtime employment began to be observed in exportrelated manufacturing sectors.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to monitor the aforementioned private sector adjustment.",
        "If these impacts were broadened, the purchasing power of households related to exports as well as the overall economic growth could be affected going forward.",
        "2) Headline inflation in 2019 was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target due to lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with the global economic slowdown.",
        "In addition, core inflation was expected to moderate owing to subdued demandpull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that headline inflation would gradually increase toward the target in 2020 in line with the growth outlook and prospects of minimum wage increases.",
        "In the period ahead, the Committee viewed that inflation projection would face uncertainties from oil price fluctuations and weather conditions.",
        "Moreover, structural changes such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "3) Some financial system risks which might pose vulnerabilities to future financial stability had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.",
        "For instance, property sector risks abated after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure.",
        "Moreover, banks tended to be more cautious in extending loans during the economic slowdown.",
        "However, other financial stability risks had not improved and warranted continued monitoring.",
        "First, high and rising household leverage could accumulate service ratio (DSR) data in accordance with the standardized calculation methodology agreed fourth quarter of 2019.",
        "The Committee would monitor worsening debt servicing capability of households and SMEs amid economic slowdown that could affect their incomes.",
        "Second, the Committee would monitor the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment, which could lead to underpricing of risks, especially activities of saving cooperatives and leverage by large corporates.",
        "Third, the Committee would monitor risks in the real estate sector, especially the oversupply situation in some areas.",
        "This was due partly to a decline in foreign demand in response to the global economic slowdown, which could affect residential property inventories.",
        "Given the softening economic outlook and prolonged low interest rates, the Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures should be appropriately combined and more targeted to address financial stability risks.",
        "Moreover, the Bank of Thailand would cooperate with other related organizations in order to push forward household and SME debt resolutions.",
        "Such resolutions included debt restructuring and the debt clinic, together with putting into practice guidelines for responsible lending and for building financial discipline and promoting household savings.",
        "The Committee would also consider approaches in addressing systemic risks posed by large corporates as well as direct a study of additional appropriate measures to curb potentially increased risks in the future.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding monetary policy transmission after the policy rate cut.",
        "Money market rates, short-term government bond yields, and benchmark lending rates of various financial institutions gradually decreased in line with the policy rate.",
        "Meanwhile, most deposit rates remained unchanged.",
        "Real interest rates remained at a low level despite a slight increase due to declining inflation expectations.",
        "These allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding.",
        "In addition, the Committee saw the need to preserve policy space in order to cushion against possible risks in the future and deemed it necessary to monitor the impacts of the policy rate cut and fiscal stimulus measures on the economy.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members viewed that, given the already accommodative monetary policy stance, the policy rate cut might not lend significant additional support to economic growth, compared with potentially increased financial stability risks.",
        "In the discussion of the monetary policy outlook the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the developments of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially the impacts from trade tensions, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy coordination between related public and private organizations to support growth recovery and economic restructuring given structural problems facing the Thai economy that could affect competitiveness and growth outlook going forward.",
        "The problems should be firmly addressed by all related parties.",
        "Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace than the previous assessment.",
        "Advanced economies grew at a slower pace than expected due to (1) a decline in manufacturing sector and investor confidence as a result of intensified trade tensions and manufacturing and service sectors in some advanced economies, as well as a decrease in wages in some European countries.",
        "The Chinese economy would grow moderately attributable to the manufacturing sector, exports, and investment that were affected by the US trade protectionist measures.",
        "However, the economy would not slow down considerably owing to government stimulus measures to stimulate growth.",
        "Asian economies (excluding Japan and China) would also moderate due mainly to export contraction in tandem with global trade volume.",
        "Private consumption would continue to expand on the back of strong labor markets and economic stimulus measures, even though high household debt as a share of GDP in various countries would put a pressure on consumption going forward.",
        "Overall monetary policy of trading partners was expected to be more accommodative in both advanced and regional economies.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely cut its policy rate once in 2019 with an additional cut in 2020.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) would likely keep its policy rate unchanged until the first half of 2020 and would probably cut the policy rate in the case of deteriorating growth prospects.",
        "In addition, the ECB launched the new series of liquidity injection into the financial system through the third Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs III).",
        "Some regional central banks, such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and Bank Negara Malaysia, as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia cut their policy rates.",
        "Meanwhile, other central banks, such as the Bank of Korea and Bank Indonesia, kept their policy rates unchanged.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a higher probability of trading partners’ economic growth being lower than the baseline due mainly to (1) trade protectionist measures that could be prolonged and expanded to other countries such as Mexico, India, and Europe, The Committee viewed that there would be a high probability of prolonged and hard-topredict trade conflicts between the US and China due partly to upcoming US presidential election next year.",
        "Thus, the Committee saw a need to closely monitor (1) developments in trading partner economies together with the aforementioned risks in order to evaluate their impacts on the Thai economy that could occur through various macroeconomic linkages, and the Thai baht.",
        "- 2 Concerns in the global financial markets grew in response to intensified trade tensions, especially between the US and China.",
        "However, the concerns abated after some central banks signaled more dovish monetary policy stance.",
        "Consequently, investors shifted to invest more in risky assets.",
        "Trade protectionist measures between the US and China, which would be prolonged and could expand to other countries such as Mexico, India, and Europe, caused overall prices of risky assets to drop temporarily.",
        "Moreover, market expectations on various central banks’ monetary policy would be more dovish.",
        "The latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement and interviews of some members signaled a higher probability of a policy rate cut this year.",
        "As a result, foreign investors’ concerns eased and reallocated their investment to emerging market assets.",
        "Overall prices of risky assets continued to increase.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields declined in line with those of advanced economies, while foreign and domestic investors continued to invest more in Thai long-term bonds.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht appreciated against the US dollar at a somewhat fast pace due to several factors.",
        "On the external front, factors included (1) Fed’s accommodative monetary policy stance, resulting in US dollar depreciation, and (2) trade protectionism that caused investors to invest more in safe haven assets including those in Thailand.",
        "On the domestic front, factors included (1) a greater clarity pertaining to political developments and factors attracted more equity as well as both short- and long-term bond inflows to Thailand.",
        "Another factor contributing to pressures on the baht was gold trading by Thai investors to earn profits when gold prices rose.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht appreciated faster than regional currencies.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) continued to appreciate.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due to various factors, which included (1) the global economic slowdown, (2) trade protectionism, and (3) prolonged and uncertain developments of the Brexit.",
        "These could cause asset prices and exchange rates to fluctuate.",
        "The Committee viewed that the somewhat rapid appreciation of the baht might not be consistent with economic fundamentals and could negatively affect economic growth going forward.",
        "Given moderating economic prospects, current economic data from various sectors reflected that the Thai economy would be more sensitive to currency appreciation.",
        "The labor market showed some signs of vulnerabilities, especially in the export-related manufacturing sector and the tourism sector.",
        "The Committee, therefore, saw a need to closely monitor developments of exchange rates, capital flows, as well as impacts on the economy through various channels, especially employment.",
        "The Committee deemed it necessary to prepare short-term capital inflow management measures ready to be implemented at an appropriate time, as well as to continue relaxing more capital outflow regulations to encourage a greater flow of outward portfolio investment by residents.",
        "The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed due mainly to exports of goods and services.",
        "Merchandise exports would expand at a significantly slower pace than the previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies - 3 and global trade volume after trade tensions, particularly between the US and China, intensified as well as a down cycle of electronic products.",
        "However, merchandise exports were expected to improve later in the second half of this year due partly to redirected orders and the relocation of production base to Thailand.",
        "Nonetheless, the recovery during the second half of this year coudld not turn export growth positive this year.",
        "Exports of services would likely grow at a slower pace due mainly to a decrease in Chinese tourist figures as a result of China’s economic slowdown, the Chinese government policies to promote domestic tourism, and changing destinations of Chinese tourists to other regional countries following increased tourism competition.",
        "Private consumption, especially durable goods consumption, would continue expanding on the back of government stimulus measures through tax deduction and an increase in government transfers to support low-income earners through the social welfare card.",
        "Nevertheless, private consumption would be restrained by elevated household debt, particularly among low-income households, and some signs of moderation in non-farm earnings and employment in the export-related manufacturing sector.",
        "In any case, the labor market had been adjusted over the previous year.",
        "Some low-income workers increasingly shifted from the manufacturing sector, which affected by a decline in exports, toward the service and trade sectors.",
        "Private investment was also projected to expand at a slower pace in line with the export outlook and softening investment confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, investment in the manufacturing sector would likely expand going forward, reflected by growing imports of capital goods in the machinery category.",
        "The relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership infrastructure investment projects (PPP) would support private investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure would likely grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to (1) the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Expenditure Budget Act, B.E.",
        "2563 (A.D. 2020), which would affect capital disbursement for new projects, and (2) delays in some state-owned enterprise investment projects.",
        "The Committee expected that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate in 2019 and 2020 than the previous assessment due mainly to exports of goods and services.",
        "Growth was projected to be 3.3 percent in 2019 and 3.7 percent in 2020, which were lower than the previous assessment of 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.",
        "There were possibilities that growth could be lower than the baseline projection include (1) trade protectionism that could be intensified and would affect global trade volume and subsequently Thailand’s merchandise exports more than expected, (2) lower-than-expected trading partners’ economic growth due to several uncertainties such as trade protectionist measures that could be intensified, consequences of a no-deal Brexit, Chinese economic and financial stability problems, and geopolitical risks, (3) a delay in forming the new government, which would affect budget disbursement and government policy implementation, and (4) lower-thanexpected growth of Chinese tourist figures.",
        "Nevertheless, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a higher rate than the baseline projection owing to from government stimulus measures or in case of alleviated uncertainties and (2) higher-thanexpected domestic demand arising from public investment in infrastructure, PPP projects, quick acceleration of private investment following greater political clarity, as well as additional government measures to support private spending.",
        "- 4 The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding global economic and domestic uncertainties, particularly trade protectionist measures between the US and China that could be prolonged and intensified in the period ahead.",
        "This would affect the Thai economy in three aspects.",
        "First, the weakening of the global economy and global trade would result in growing concerns of businesses and impinge upon merchandise exports, tourism, and investment in Thailand.",
        "Second, on trade diversion, Thai exports that were part of the supply chain of Chinese exports to the US would be adversely affected.",
        "On the other hand, some Thai exporters would benefit by substituting Chinese products exported to the US.",
        "However, some Chinese products previously exported to the US market could be dumped into Thailand, which in any case accounted for a small proportion of Thailand’s total imports of goods.",
        "Third, on investment diversion, there could be a relocation of production base of foreign businesses to ASEAN countries including Thailand in order to substitute the production in China.",
        "The Committee saw a need to monitor the outcome of trade negotiation between the US and China, the Chinese economic outlook, Brexit developments, and direction of new government policies, which could affect the continuation of public and private investment projects as well as risks to financial stability and medium-term fiscal position.",
        "The annual headline inflation was projected to remain close to the lower bound of the inflation target, with fresh food prices expected to increase relative to the previous meeting.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation would be mostly in line with the previous projection.",
        "The Committee assessed that pressures from energy prices remained broadly unchanged from the previous assessment.",
        "The oil production cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and an increase in geopolitical risks in Middle East would compensate for the decrease in demand in tandem with the global economic slowdown.",
        "Fresh food prices were projected to rise due especially to a less severe pork oversupply and an increase in external demand from China and regional countries affected by the swine disease outbreaks.",
        "The Committee thus projected headline inflation at 1.0 percent in 2019 and 2020.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to gradually increase in line with domestic demand at 0.7 and 0.9 percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
        "Core inflation projection was revised down somewhat as a result of softer domestic demand.",
        "There would remain a probability of headline and core inflation being lower than the baseline in line with risks to the economic projection.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due mainly to exports of goods and services, while private consumption was expected to continue expanding.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to be close to the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "However, there were risks to financial stability that warranted close monitoring, particularly a rise in household debt and the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio.",
        "In addition, external and domestic uncertainties would remain high in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee therefore unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting and discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their - 5 1) The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed due mainly to exports of goods and services.",
        "Merchandise exports would grow at a significantly slower pace than previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade volume.",
        "The slowdown was affected by intensifying trade protectionist measures, particularly between the US and China.",
        "However, Thai exports were affected to a lesser extent compared with those of other regional countries due to a smaller portion of Thai exports integrated into the Chinese supply chain and more diversified exports products.",
        "Tourism would grow moderately due mainly to the number of Chinese tourists.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to continue expanding but would be restrained by elevated household debt as well as signs of moderation in earnings and employment in the export-related manufacturing sector.",
        "Private investment was projected to slowdown.",
        "However, the relocation of production base to Thailand and the PPP infrastructure projects would support investment going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, public expenditure would decelerate more than previously estimated due mainly to the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, B.E.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economic growth would encounter uncertainties mainly from the external front that could affect the growth prospect going forward.",
        "These uncertainties included, in particular, (1) trade protectionism that could be intensified and prolonged which would subsequently cause global trade volume to expand at a slower pace than expected and affect Thailand’s merchandise exports and (2) a worse-than-expected growth outlook for advanced economies and China that could affect domestic demand, especially in case of economic and financial stability concerns, no-deal Brexit, and geopolitical risks.",
        "Key domestic uncertainties included (1) a delayed formation of the new government which could affect the continuity of budget disbursements and (2) new government policies such as minimum wage and welfare policies.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor developments in the labor market as well as the quality of credits extended to economic sectors that would be affected by trade protectionism and the economic slowdown.",
        "2) Some pockets of risks in the financial system might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "First, high and rising household leverage, as especially reflected in auto leasing and mortgage loans, would elevate the household debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "Meanwhile, the NPL ratio of auto loans, driven especially by new-entry NPLs, was poised to increase continuously.",
        "This was due partly to (1) more lenient credit underwriting standards over the recent periods as a result of heightened competition from increasing participation of non-bank financial institutions and (2) a decrease in farm income and household income in the provinces.",
        "Moreover, there would be a need to monitor deteriorating debt serviceability of SMEs, especially in the trading sector where the new-entry NPL rate remained high.",
        "This reflected structural problems of some groups of small enterprises that could not adapt to changes.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks that were related to the cooperatives system and leverage by large corporates.",
        "Third, risks in the real estate sector remained, especially the oversupply of property in some areas as well as the decline in foreign demand in response to the global economic slowdown that could affect property destocking.",
        "The Committee viewed that macroprudential measures already implemented helped curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent.",
        "However, - 6 safeguarding financial stability in the period ahead would remain necessary and could be done through a combination of tools, including the appropriate policy interest rate, macroprudential measures, and microprudential measures.",
        "Regarding the current context, more emphasis should be placed on debt serviceability of borrowers since credit supervision by categories could not resolve the household debt problem.",
        "Therefore, the Committee deemed it necessary to monitor the impacts of the implemented macroprudential measures and to examine further appropriate macroprudential measures to prevent systemic risks 3) The annual headline inflation would be largely unchanged compared with the previous assessment and would remain close to the lower bound of the inflation target.",
        "Core inflation was projected to be in line with the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee viewed that there remained risks to inflation in the period ahead due to fluctuations in oil prices, weather and drought conditions, as well as uncertainty in the minimum wage policy that could be raised this year.",
        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy allowed headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes, such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs, could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past.",
        "This posed implications for the future appropriate inflation target.",
        "The Committee viewed that the inflation target could be reviewed in accordance with inflation dynamic and the changing context.",
        "Thus, the inflation target could become more flexible and be in a more forward-looking manner, together with maintaining stability of medium-term inflation expectations.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed monetary policy outlook and viewed that the economy would expand at a slower pace due mainly to momentum of external demand.",
        "However, the Thai economy would grow around its potential going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, there remained risks to financial stability that must be continually monitored, as well as high uncertainties arising from both external and domestic factors in the future.",
        "The current accommodative monetary policy would, therefore, remain appropriate.",
        "However, the Committee would monitor the developments of the outlook for growth, inflation, financial stability, and exchange rate, together with associated risks, especially the impacts of international trade protectionism, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "Trading partner economies would expand at a slower pace.",
        "Advanced and Asian economies were affected by economic and political uncertainties, particularly global trade slowdown, together with country-specific factors such as the temporary impact of US government shutdown, extended political issues in Europe, and uncertainties of trade protectionist measures between the US and China.",
        "These uncertainties subsequently impinged on economic activities, especially production and merchandise exports.",
        "However, favorable labor market conditions would bolster private consumption and drive the economy going forward.",
        "The Chinese economy would expand at a slower pace despite some supports by government measures and accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The overall monetary policy stance of trading partners would be more accommodative.",
        "The Federal Reserve (Fed) was expected to delay its further rate hike due to growing concerns over the economic outlook and downward pressure of inflation.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) would hold its policy rate at least through the end of 2019, which was longer than market expectations.",
        "The ECB also announced a plan for additional liquidity injection into the financial system through targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).",
        "The Bank of Japan (BOJ) was expected to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Monetary policy stance of other regional central banks were expected to be more accommodative, with policy rates mostly kept unchanged throughout this year.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a probability of trading partner economies’ growth being lower than the baseline owing to the risks of trade negotiations between the US and China as well as a no-deal Brexit.",
        "The Committee saw a need to closely monitor developments of the aforementioned risks and evaluate their effects on the trading partner economic outlook, particularly the rise in inventory among advanced economies during the fourth quarter of 2018, which would impact production and private consumption going forward.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets improved in the near term despite some increased concerns about the global economic slowdown.",
        "This was due to a more accommodative monetary policy stance of the Fed and the ECB, improvement in trade negotiations between the US and China, and a declined risk of a no-deal Brexit early in the quarter.",
        "Foreign investors thus continuously increased holdings of risky assets.",
        "Net capital inflows into equity markets of emerging market economies (EMs) increased, while net capital outflows from EM bond markets slightly decreased, resulting in higher prices of risky assets - 2 in the region.",
        "Meanwhile, Thai asset prices recently experienced additional pressures from political uncertainties.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index declined slightly, while regional indices increased.",
        "Thai government bond yields rose slightly due to a reduction in foreign bond holdings.",
        "On exchange rates the Thai baht depreciated slightly against the US dollar since the previous meeting in line with regional currencies.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) index also depreciated.",
        "The Committee viewed that global financial markets would remain highly uncertain due primarily to (1) monetary policy direction of advanced economies, (2) progress on trade negotiations between the US and China, and (3) Brexit and political situation in the euro area that could intensify and affect the global economy as well as cross-border capital flows, which in turn could exert pressures on asset prices and regional exchange rates.",
        "Moreover, Thai asset prices might face additional pressures from domestic uncertainties following the announcement of election results and the formation of the new government.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial markets and exchange rates, as well as their impacts on the Thai economy.",
        "The Thai economy as a whole was expected to continue expanding around its potential on the back of domestic demand despite external demand slowdown.",
        "Private consumption was expected to continue expanding across all product categories on the back of increasingly broad-based improvements in both farm and non-farm income with additional supports from government measures.",
        "Nevertheless, private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment was projected to continue expanding thanks to the relocation of production base in some industries to Thailand, public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure investment projects, and favorable business sentiment.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports would expand at a slower pace due to (1) the effect of trade protectionist measures between the US and China on global trade volume and trading partner economies and (2) a down cycle of electronic products.",
        "However, merchandise exports would later improve during the second half of 2019 due partly to (1) redirected orders from China as well as relocation of production base in some industries to Thailand, and (2) exports of Thai electronic parts benefitting from infrastructure investment pertaining to 5G technology in foreign countries.",
        "Exports of services would continually expand due to recovery in tourist figures with regained sentiments and the extension of the visa on arrival fee waiver until the end of April 2019.",
        "Meanwhile, tourism expenditure would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to a slowdown in trading partner economies.",
        "Public expenditure, both consumption and investment, were expected to grow but at a slower pace than previously assessed due to (1) delayed progress on some state-owned enterprise infrastructure investment projects, (2) changes in the investment structure of some public-private partnership projects to allow for greater investment by the private sector, and the budget structure for fiscal year 2020, resulting in a smaller composition of capital and current expenditures.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy to expand around its potential in 2019 and 2020 despite growing at a rate somewhat slower than expected due to external demand slowdown, - 3 while domestic demand would continue to gain traction.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to grow at 3.8 percent in 2019, which was lower than previous assessment at 4.0 percent, and at 3.9 percent in 2020.",
        "There were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a rate below the baseline projection due to (1) lower-than-expected trading partner economic growth due to uncertainties such as trade protectionist measures between the US and China that could be intensified and (2) lower-than-expected private investment due to political uncertainties.",
        "Nevertheless, there were possibilities that the Thai economy would expand at a higher rate than baseline projection owing to (1) the Chinese economy slowing down only marginally due to economic stimulus measures and (2) higher-than-expected domestic demand from public investment in infrastructure, PPP projects, earlier-than-expected acceleration of private investment after political uncertainties eased up, as well as additional government measures in supporting private expenditure.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the economic outlook and viewed that future economic activity would still expand around its potential.",
        "The momentum would come from domestic demand, especially private consumption that was driven by the continuation of favorable labor market conditions across almost all sectors.",
        "Private investment started to show some signs of clarity expected to be in the second half of this year.",
        "This would also continue to support growth momentum, particularly investment under Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and PPP projects in addition to the relocation of production base from other countries to Thailand that had been partly proceeded.",
        "The Committee saw a need to closely monitor (1) domestic demand momentum, both private consumption and investment, (2) policy direction under the new government which could affect the continuation of public and private investment projects, imports of capital goods, the current account adjustment in the period ahead, as well as risks to financial stability and risks to medium-term fiscal position, and (3) drought condition which could intensify and affect economic activities going forward.",
        "Headline inflation increased from the previous meeting due to higher energy prices.",
        "Additionally, fresh food prices rose as the excess supply of pork and eggs alleviated.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was lower than expected due to the prices of food-in-core category, housing rent, public transportation services, and vehicles.",
        "The Committee assessed that the annual average headline inflation was broadly in line with previous projection due to (1) continued upward pressure on energy prices due to the OPEC’s cut in oil production to compensate for the decrease in demand in tandem with the global economic slowdown, and The Committee thus kept the headline inflation projection unchanged at 1.0 percent in 2019 and expected headline inflation for 2020 to rise to 1.1 percent.",
        "Core inflation would increase gradually in line with domestic demand and was revised to 0.8 percent for 2019, down from the previous assessment of 0.9 percent, while the forecast for 2020 was expected to average at 0.9 percent.",
        "There is a probability of headline and core inflation being lower than the baseline in line with risks to the economic projection.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand around its potential on the back of continued support from domestic demand, despite a slowdown in external demand.",
        "- 4 Headline inflation was expected to be around the lower bound of the inflation target, while core inflation would be lower than previously assessed.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Nevertheless, global economic and domestic uncertainties increased.",
        "The Committee therefore unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting in order to assess the clarity of impacts from such uncertainties.",
        "The Committee also viewed that, going forward, there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of policy tools, including appropriate changes in the policy rate, as well as the use of macroprudential and microprudential measures.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "1) The Thai economy would continue to expand at the level around its potential in line with the previous assessment.",
        "This expansion would be driven by strong momentum from domestic demand, both private consumption and investment, which would be supported by government measures, the relocation of production base to Thailand, and the prospect of PPP projects.",
        "Tourism also continued to gain traction.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports growth would weaken due to the global economic slowdown, the plateauing electronics cycle, and the impact of trade protectionist measures between the US and China.",
        "The Committee viewed that the economy would experience increased uncertainties from domestic and external factors that could affect economic growth in the period ahead.",
        "These uncertainties included in particular (1) trade protectionist measures between the US and China that could intensify and subsequently affect trading partner economies and Thailand’s merchandise exports, (2) global growth, particularly in China and Europe, that could slow down and could impinge on domestic demand, and (3) limited progress on significant infrastructure investment projects that could have knock-on effects on private investment, especially during the transition period of policy formation by the new government.",
        "2) There were pockets of risks in the financial system that could pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "First, household leverage increased, driven particularly by auto-leasing and personal loans.",
        "Meanwhile, credit quality of mortgage and auto-leasing loans continued to deteriorate due in part to more relaxed credit underwriting standards in the previous period.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "For example, the assets of saving cooperatives continued to grow.",
        "Large saving cooperatives also played a greater role in the cooperatives system by extending more loans to other saving cooperatives.",
        "Meanwhile, large corporates increased their fundraising in the prolonged low interest rate environment, representing a larger share of the bond market and commercial bank loans.",
        "Third, risks in the real estate sector remained, including oversupply of property in some areas, foreign demand for Thai properties, as well as competition in the mortgage loan market, despite commercial banks exercising greater caution in ensuring that new loans extended to borrowers would correspond to their financial positions.",
        "Meanwhile, real estate developers continued to increase their funding through commercial bank loans and bonds.",
        "- 5 In the period ahead, the Committee viewed that an appropriate level of the policy rate would still be necessary to preserve financial stability.",
        "Macroprudential and microprudential measures could only address risks in connection with loans and financial institutions under loans.",
        "Moreover, most Committee members deemed it necessary to monitor the impacts of the implemented macroprudential measures, and to study additional appropriate macroprudential measures to more effectively prevent systemic risks.",
        "Most Committee members also viewed that both rising household leverage and large corporates that might underprice risks warranted monitoring.",
        "3) Headline inflation would be largely unchanged compared with the previous assessment.",
        "This would be attributable to higher energy and fresh food prices offsetting the lower-thanexpected core inflation.",
        "The Committee therefore would monitor factors that could affect crude oil prices in the period ahead, including oil price expectations inferred from the financial markets and the oil production outlook, especially regarding the OPEC.",
        "Moreover, the Committee would monitor factors, particularly an intensified drought, that could increase fresh food prices.",
        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy had allowed headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes such as the impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, heightened price competition, and productivity upgrades which reduced production costs all could cause inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past despite the continued expansion of the Thai economy.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed monetary policy outlook and judged that, for the current meeting, the Committee would need to wait and assess the clarity of various factors due to heightened global economic and domestic uncertainties.",
        "Therefore, current accommodative policy would remain appropriate.",
        "Going forward, a policy rate increase would be gradual and follow a data-dependent approach, with a careful assessment of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."

        "Meanwhile, economic activities in Asian economies were affected by the more severe outbreak and virus mutations in several countries.",
        "In the period ahead, the global economic recovery would remain highly uncertain as the outbreak could become more severe due to virus mutations, particularly in countries with slow vaccination progress and limited access to effective vaccines.",
        "Concerns in the global financial markets heightened due to the COVID-19 outbreak situation, which became more severe in several countries, especially in emerging markets with low vaccination rates.",
        "This led to risk-off sentiments among investors and a decline in the holdings of risky assets such as equities and an increase in the holdings of safe assets such as government bonds.",
        "The Thai financial markets moved in line with other regional markets with a decline in Thai stock market index and government bond yields.",
        "On exchange rates, the Thai baht and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated since the previous meeting.",
        "The baht depreciated against the US dollar more than regional currencies due to an intensified COVID-19 outbreak situation and the outlook of slow economic recovery in Thailand.",
        "Looking ahead, volatility in the global financial markets would remain high and could weigh on the Thai financial markets.",
        "Significant risks included the COVID-19 outbreak situation, which remained highly uncertain and could intensify in many countries, and the US fiscal and monetary policy outlook.",
        "In particular, should the US economy continue to recover and inflation continue to rise, the Federal Reserve might tighten the monetary policy faster than market expected.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a much slower rate due to stricter COVID- 19 containment measures, which would impinge on economic activities and domestic demand.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy was projected to expand by 0.7 and 3.7 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively.",
        "This would be significantly lower than the June projection owing to private consumption which was greatly affected this year and foreign tourist figures which were expected to be significantly lower next year.",
        "The labor market would be more fragile, particularly the services sector and the self- employed, which experienced income losses.",
        "Nevertheless, key growth drivers going forward were as follows.",
        "First, public expenditure would be higher thanks to the new Emergency Decree authorizing a 500 billion baht borrowing which would somewhat shore up household purchasing power and mitigate impacts from the latest wave of the outbreak.",
        "Second, merchandise exports were expected to register a strong growth on the back of external demand recovery of trading partners, although some manufacturing and export sectors would experience supply constraints.",
        "Headwinds included, for example, reduced working hours in the manufacturing sector after the government imposed stricter containment measures as well as global shortages of containers and raw materials, particularly electronic parts.",
        "Headline inflation would remain unchanged, while core inflation would still be subdued owing to weak domestic demand.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "There remain significant downside risks to the economic outlook.",
        "First, the outbreak situation in Thailand and other countries could become more severe.",
        "This was due particularly to virus mutations which could reduce vaccine efficacy.",
        "Slow vaccination progress could also lead to a more prolonged and severe public health crisis.",
        "Second, financial positions of businesses, especially the services sector, that became more vulnerable could lead to widespread business closures and lay-offs.",
        "Third, supply constraints, especially owing to factory outbreaks and temporary shortages of raw materials, could become more severe and prolonged, thus affecting the manufacturing and export sectors more than expected.",
        "Such constraints were expected to alleviate in the first half of 2022.",
        "The financial system would be more vulnerable.",
        "The latest wave of the outbreak aggravated income and the already fragile financial positions of households and businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood of debt at risk.",
        "Nevertheless, financial positions of financial institutions remained robust and could accommodate deteriorating credit quality in the future.",
        "Therefore, the impacts from the aforementioned risks on overall financial stability would still be limited.",
        "The Committee discussed risks to the Thai economy due to the impacts of potentially more severe and prolonged outbreak, measures that should be urgently implemented, as well as monetary policy and financial measures.",
        "The details were as followed.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Thai economy were larger than the previous assessment, and there remained significant downside risks that the outbreak could become more severe and prolonged than expected.",
        "Vaccine distribution which would take some time could cause the numbers of new and critical cases to increase continuously and exceed the health system capacity.",
        "Containment measures that could become stricter and prolonged would further dampen economic activities.",
        "Meanwhile, business and consumer confidence could fall significantly in line with declining income.",
        "This would in turn affect the consumption outlook.",
        "The prolonged outbreak resulted in a more uneven recovery across different sectors, a more fragile labor market, and potential long- term scarring effects especially on employment in the services sector and among self-employed workers whose working hours began to decline.",
        "More workers also migrated back to their home provinces.",
        "In addition, the labor market was expected to recover slowly as reflected by the rising number of the long-term unemployed and newly-graduated unemployed as well as persons outside the labor force.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the most important issue for the Thai economy at present was to accelerate containment of the outbreak and prevention of the spread, especially the procurement and distribution of effective vaccines in a timely manner.",
        "This would help reduce the infections to the level compatible with the health system capacity and allow for the relaxation of the containment measures.",
        "This would contribute to a gradual pickup in economic activities.",
        "Fiscal measures should help alleviate the adverse impacts and support the economy by more actively addressing unemployment and vulnerabilities in the business sector in an adequate and timely manner.",
        "The public debt-to-GDP ratio could rise and exceed 60 percent.",
        "Nonetheless, this would not pose a significant risk to fiscal sustainability if the budget were to be spent efficiently towards shoring up the economy that was facing high risks in the short run and supporting economic restructuring to raise potential growth.",
        "Subsequently, the public debt-to-GDP ratio could fall in the long run.",
        "Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions.",
        "The baht recently depreciated and thus did not hinder the economic recovery.",
        "Government bond yields and commercial bank lending rates remained low.",
        "However, ample liquidity was not distributed to the affected businesses and households.",
        "Financial and credit measures should thus be adjusted quickly to enhance effectiveness and to have broader impacts.",
        "Although the special loan facility had helped facilitate access to credits for SMEs and the two-month loan payment holiday helped ease debt burden somewhat, the latest wave of the outbreak would likely be prolonged and have larger impacts on the economy than expected.",
        "Thus, liquidity distribution should be expedited and financial institutions should effectively help reduce debt burden for borrowers by, for instance, applying debt restructuring methods that were consistent with long-term borrowers’ debt serviceability.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee viewed that there should be additional measures that were designed to incentivize less affected households and businesses with high savings to increase spending and stimulate domestic demand going forward.",
        "- The Committee extensively discussed the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in the current situation, the net benefits of the policy rate reduction to the economy, as well as various policy options.",
        "The Committee agreed that financial measures could help those who were affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in a more targeted manner than the policy rate reduction.",
        "The Committee viewed that, first, the important issue at present would be the distribution of the ample liquidity in the banking system to businesses and households with high credit risks.",
        "Second, the slowdown in economic activities was a consequence of disease containment.",
        "Meanwhile, overall financial conditions remained accommodative and helped financial institutions to provide support for borrowers through various ongoing financial measures.",
        "Third, financial measures, particularly the special soft loan facility that helped alleviate liquidity constraints for the affected groups and debt restructuring which helped address elevated debt problems, would be more effective and targeted than the reduction in the policy rate which was a blunt instrument.",
        "Despite the broad-based impacts, the policy rate cut would only marginally reduce debt burden for vulnerable groups.",
        "Nonetheless, some members viewed that the policy rate cut at this meeting would be a preemptive action against the potential economic slowdown in the period ahead.",
        "They assessed that the previously implemented financial and fiscal measures might have some limitations and remain inadequate.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary policy would take some time before the impacts reached the economy.",
        "They thus voted to cut the policy rate at this meeting, although the policy rate was deemed less targeted and effective than other financial and fiscal measures, to mitigate heightening risks in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.",

        "The Committee viewed that risks to the economic outlook remained high.",
        "The support must be provided by accelerating the distribution of liquidity and debt burden reduction for those who were affected.",

        "In the baseline scenario, positive developments in vaccine distribution would help contain the outbreak by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021.",
        "This would enable herd immunity attainment within the first half of 2022 and the Thai economy would return to the pre-COVID level by the end of the same year.",
        "However, in the scenario that the outbreak became more prolonged than the baseline, a new outbreak could emerge due to a more easily transmissible and deadly mutant.",
        "In this case, herd immunity would be delayed to the end of 2022 and the Thai economy would return to the pre-COVID level at the beginning of 2023.",
        "Thus, the Committee viewed that the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines against new virus mutations adequately and timely was the most important issue facing the Thai economy.",
        "This would prevent a prolonged and severe outbreak.",
        "Meanwhile, fiscal stimulus measures should be expedited.",
        "Monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "Adequate and targeted financial measures to assist businesses and households affected by the pandemic should be pushed forward, especially the special loan facility, asset warehousing, and debt restructuring.",
        "All parties should accelerate various measures to produce results and support the economy through this period, especially during the next six months where uncertainties would remain high.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the recurring outbreaks increased labor market fragility.",
        "Recovery in labor markets would be W-shaped and slower than the past.",
        "Despite some improvements in the overall employment after the relaxation of containment measures against the first- wave outbreak, recurring waves of infections would increase fragility in the labor markets, particularly the services sector and among the self- employed.",
        "Recent indicators reflected that that some employers adopted a rotation system among workers and cut their working hours.",
        "The number of workers who returned to their hometowns recorded a historic high.",
        "Most dismissed workers in the services sector could not reallocate to the manufacturing sector with improving prospects due to their skill mismatch.",
        "Moreover, the number of the long-term and newly-graduated unemployed as well as persons outside the labor force continued to rise.",
        "The Committee assessed that the government should address vulnerabilities in the labor markets in an adequate and continuous manner to reduce long- term scarring effects after the COVID-19 outbreak subsided.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the temporary increase in headline inflation in the second quarter of 2021 was not a point of concern.",
        "The increase was due to the low level of crude oil prices in the same period last year and transitory supply constraints.",
        "Meanwhile, reflation in the advanced economies would have limited spillovers to domestic inflation as imported consumer products accounted for only 16 percent of the Thai CPI basket.",
        "Additionally, producers decided to bear the rising costs of production due to difficulties of price pass-through during an economic slowdown.",
        "In the period ahead, headline inflation would edge down toward the lower bound of the target range due to the following factors.",
        "First, global crude oil prices would rise at a slower pace as oil producers were capable of expanding production capacity to meet global demand.",
        "Second, raw food prices would decrease as the risks of drought subsided.",
        "Third, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low due to a high level of household debt and fragile labor markets.",
        "- The Committee reiterated the need for structural reform policies to raise long-term potential growth of the Thai economy.",
        "This would alleviate the impacts of the COVID- to the following factors.",
        "First, the recovery among different sectors would be highly uneven, especially the severely affected tourism sector.",
        "Second, income inequality would intensify for the unemployed and the self-employed with income reduction.",
        "Third, financial positions of businesses and households would become more fragile.",
        "Consequently, without appropriate measures, long-term potential growth of the Thai economy would decline.",
        "The Committee viewed that all related parties should jointly support structural transformation of the Thai economy by identifying key objectives and establish policy guidelines for both the short and long term as well as push forward their implementation.",
        "In particular, business model adjustments as well as the upskilling and reskilling of labor to suit the post-COVID environment should be facilitated.",
        "These would support a sustainable economic recovery and bolster the resilience of the Thai economy against future negative economic shocks.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would be slower and more uneven than the previous forecast due to the third-wave outbreak.",
        "Downside risks to the economic outlook remained significant given the new wave.",
        "As a result, the balance sheets of some businesses and households became more fragile.",
        "Additional measures should thus be more targeted and in line with the need of borrowers, helping to distribute liquidity to the affected businesses and households broadly.",
        "These measures included financial and credit measures, credit guarantees, and expedited debt restructuring.",
        "Such measures would alleviate the financial burden of businesses and households in a more targeted manner than a reduction in the policy rate.",
        "The policy rate was already at a low level and cutting it might provide limited support to the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting and would stand ready to use the limited policy space at the most effective The Committee would continue to monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows to ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Although pressures on the baht would abate in tandem with the projected current account deficit in 2021, the Committee would continuously expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem to improve the structure of the Thai foreign exchange markets over the medium term.",
        "The Committee viewed that by encouraging Thai institutional investors to increase their portfolio investments abroad, it would facilitate capital outflows and improve the balance between capital inflows and outflows.",
        "The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among agencies would be critical in restoring the economy from the new outbreak.",
        "Short-term measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged and reduce economic costs.",
        "Fiscal measures would play a crucial role in driving the economic recovery amid high uncertainties.",
        "Thus, the government should accelerate the disbursement of relief and other fiscal support measures to provide adequate and continuous economic stimulus as well as address vulnerabilities in the labor markets.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "The new financial rehabilitation measures to restore businesses affected by COVID-19, together with other measures by specialized financial institutions, should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic recovery.",
        "In addition, financial institutions should assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",
        "In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",

        "The public debt-to-GDP ratio would eventually decline thanks to economic expansion and the government’s ability to collect more revenues.",
        "Government spending should emphasize on productive projects such as co- payment schemes with high fiscal multipliers.",
        "In addition, government spending should be transparent and verifiable.",
        "In the period ahead, the government should prepare a clear guideline to reduce public debt-to-GDP ratio to preserve fiscal discipline and build up fiscal space to accommodate potential risks by, for instance, (1) generating additional government revenues by expanding tax bases and (2) scaling up capital expenditure relative to current expenditures, which would contribute to long-term economic growth.",

        "Despite ample liquidity in the banking system, there was an issue of distributing liquidity to the affected businesses and households.",

        "Financial and credit measures have made significant progress, especially the special loan facility that was well-distributed in terms of borrowers and their credit risk profiles.",
        "However, some additional policies should be expedited to distribute liquidity to those affected in a targeted and continuous manner.",
        "These included (1) the second phase of the special loan facility of which conditions and credit guarantee criteria were revised to help enhance credit access for borrowers with high credit risks, as well as expanding credit lines for borrowers with low credit lines or those who had never been issued credit, (2) the asset warehousing scheme, (3) other measures under specialized financial institutions (SFIs) such as loans for affected SMEs and retail borrowers, and (4) debt restructuring through financial institutions should be expedited to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",
        "For example, a further relaxation in asset classification and provisioning criteria would reduce the costs for financial institutions and allow them to assist borrowers more sustainably than repayment extension.",
        "Furthermore, the reduction in the FIDF fee to 0.23 percent was extended until the end of 2022, which would allow financial institutions to continuously transfer the lower costs to aid businesses and households.",

        "Despite some progress on financial measures, liquidity distribution and debt restructuring should be expedited further for those who were affected.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction in the policy rate, which was already low, and thus voted to maintain the policy The Committee assessed that the baht exhibited more volatile movements due to domestic and external factors.",
        "The baht against the US dollar exhibited two-way movements, appreciating after the relaxation of containment measures but depreciated quickly as central banks in AEs signaled gradual normalization.",
        "Investor concerns over the global economic recovery and the default risks of the Evergrande Group, which could escalate into a systematic risk, also contributed to volatile exchange rates.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets to maintain exchange rate stability and ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder business adjustments.",

        "Nevertheless, the global economy would remain subject to the risk of rising global energy prices, particularly prices of natural gas and coal, during the recovery phase that led to higher crude oil prices.",
        "The global energy prices were expected to gradually decrease in line with the decline in energy demand after the end of winter and the projected increase in oil supply from OPEC Plus and the US next year.",

        "There would be a risk of central banks in AEs adopting a faster pace of monetary policy normalization to cope with elevated inflation.",

        "First, the Oil Fund helped manage domestic energy prices by subsidizing diesel and LPG prices.",
        "Moreover, the fuel tariff electricity charge rate (Ft rate) was under regulation.",
        "The global energy prices were expected to decline after the first quarter of 2022 due to the end of winter and the increase of oil supply from major producers.",
        "Second, rising costs for businesses in tandem with global commodity prices due to global supply disruption were expected to have limited pass-through to consumer prices.",
        "This is because purchasing power was recovering slowly, thus lowering ability of firms to increase prices and forcing them to absorb the higher costs.",
        "Meanwhile, only higher inflation was a result of relative price changes from some goods such as oil prices, rather than a broad-based price increase, reflecting subdued demand-side inflationary pressures.",

        "First, the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country could affect the recovery and employment, which going forward would vary across businesses and geographical areas.",
        "A survey of domestic businesses revealed that manufacturing, retail, and restaurants would recover faster than hotels and transport of passengers.",
        "Second, the momentum of fiscal support could decelerate after the phase-out of existing measures.",
        "Third, higher costs could pass through to consumer prices, as producers might raise prices if the higher global prices of energy persisted longer than anticipated, if global supply disruption became more prolonged than expected, or if costs of various inputs increased simultaneously.",
        "- The Committee assessed that headline inflation would increase temporarily in accordance with projected global energy prices.",
        "However, there remained a risk of the elevated global energy prices persisting longer than expected.",
        "Thus, inflation dynamics warranted close monitoring.",
        "Some MPC members expressed concerns that global energy prices could remain persistently high.",
        "This could happen in several instances such as (1) if global energy demand rebounded in line with the global economic recovery, (2) if global energy supply increased by less than expected as a result of insufficient investment in oil drilling rigs, and (3) if there were energy transitions in many countries toward lower greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Should the surge of global energy prices last longer than anticipated, domestic energy prices would be affected as the Oil Fund would have limited capacity.",
        "If the prices of energy used as basic factors of production such as diesel, natural gas, and electricity were to increase, there would be knock-on effects on prices of other goods and services.",
        "Inflation expectations of consumers and businesses could subsequently rise.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor the outlook of global energy prices as well as other factors that could affect inflation dynamics.",
        "- The Committee viewed that an important issue for the Thai economy was to ensure the sustained recovery as the economy would still be subject to several risks such as (1) recurrent outbreaks after the country’s re-opening, especially with rising demand for foreign workers that could induce illegal entrance to Thailand, (2) the momentum of fiscal support, and (3) the pass-through of global energy prices.",
        "Economic recovery could be hampered if the high prices of natural gas and oil persisted longer than expected.",
        "The Committee would continue to closely monitor and reassess risks to the economy.",
        "- The Committee assessed that recovery in the period ahead would be uneven across sectors.",
        "Despite recent signs of improvement, the uneven recovery could lead to a more fragile labor market.",
        "This was reflected in the number of employees in the social security system who applied for unemployment benefits which remained high.",
        "The number of unemployed along with underemployed workers was estimated to reach approximately 3.4 million persons by the end of 2021.",
        "Thus, government measures to address the uneven recovery and the labor market should be more targeted.",
        "The measures should also focus on restructuring the Thai economy to be compatible with the new context to reduce long-term economic scars after the outbreak subsided.",
        "- The Committee viewed fiscal policy as the main driver to provide relief and to support economic recovery.",
        "Although the momentum of fiscal support would decline somewhat after the phase-out of government measures, there would be further fiscal support from the increase of the public debt ceiling to 70 percent of GDP.",
        "This would allow the government to implement additional measures if necessary.",
        "Going forward, fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, while the balance between emergency assistance and subsequent economic rehabilitation could be reassessed to shift the focus to creating incomes as well as promoting investment to - Monetary policy contributed to continued accommodative financial conditions, with ample liquidity in the financial system and low financing costs.",
        "Financial and credit measures continued to make progress, but credit risks remained a challenge to liquidity distribution, particularly to SMEs and households.",
        "The special loan facility for businesses helped in part alleviate the problem.",
        "In addition, the Committee deemed that financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021, to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the baht exhibited more volatile movements due to domestic factors, namely the relaxation of the containment measures and the earlier-than-expected re-opening of the country.",
        "Going forward, external risk factors warranted monitoring, particularly monetary policy divergence, as they could have implications on capital flows, exchange rates, and domestic bond yields.",
        "The Committee assessed that exchange rate volatility could have adverse impacts on businesses during the recovery phase.",
        "Nonetheless, Thai businesses—mostly large corporations—carried out more foreign exchange hedging transactions recently, with exporters’ hedging ratio increasing from 25 percent at the beginning of the year to 35 percent as of October 2021.",
        "Additionally, overall hedging costs declined, though small businesses faced higher costs than large corporations.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and encourage businesses, especially SMEs, to hedge against risks from exchange rate volatility.",

        "Meanwhile, downside risks receded on account of the accelerated vaccination progress.",
        "However, the fragile recovery would remain subject to uncertainties.",
        "Looking ahead, fiscal support might taper following the substantial stimulus earlier.",
        "Merchandise exports would decelerate in tandem with growth in trading partner economies.",
        "The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",
        "In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth would play an important part in The baht relative to the US dollar exhibited more volatile movements owing to monetary policy in advanced economies and uncertainties in the Thai economic recovery outlook.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",
        "The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.",
        "Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities, particularly after the re-opening of the country.",
        "Fiscal measures should facilitate the economic recovery by focusing on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth.",
        "Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.",
        "Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden.",
        "In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring in a sustainable manner.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",
        "In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country, the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, and the global energy price pass-through.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "The global economy, particularly advanced economies, would continue to recover thanks to the progress in COVID-19 vaccination.",
        "The continued support from monetary and fiscal policies also helped to improve private consumption and exports.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy would continue to recover in tandem with the COVID-19 vaccination progress and large-scale economic stimulus in the US.",
        "The global economic recovery would improve cross-border trade, particularly in capital and electronics goods.",
        "Nevertheless, the recovery would remain uncertain due to virus mutations and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.",
        "Volatilities in global financial markets decreased as the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to continue accommodative monetary policy, resulting in an increase in prices of risky assets.",
        "Commodity prices and equity prices rose.",
        "Meanwhile, long-term US Treasury yields and Thai government bond yields became stabilized.",
        "However, investors remained cautious about emerging market assets including those of Thailand.",
        "The intensified third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand would result in slower economic recovery compared with other regional countries.",
        "Domestic assets, particularly equities, thus underperformed regional counterparts.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar relatively more than regional currencies.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated from the previous meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, volatility in global financial markets would remain high.",
        "Significant risks included (1) uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly with regard to the distribution and efficacy of vaccines and mutations and (2) US monetary and fiscal policies going forward.",
        "If the US economy exhibited robust recovery with rising inflation, US monetary policy could be normalized faster than expected.",
        "Nevertheless, spillover effects on capital flows and asset prices of most emerging markets including Thailand would be limited and less severe compared with the 2013 Taper Tantrum.",
        "This is because the Federal Reserve would gradually normalize monetary policy and carefully communicate to the public to alleviate the adverse impact on global financial markets.",
        "In addition, external stability of emerging markets, including Thailand, improved from the 2013 Taper Tantrum.",
        "Many emerging countries accumulated larger international reserves along with a decline in external debt.",
        "The Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to more severe impacts of the third-wave outbreak relative to the second.",
        "Domestic spending and the recovery of foreign tourist figures would be restrained by containment measures.",
        "In addition, new virus variants appeared to spread more easily and became harder to control.",
        "It would thus take longer time to achieve herd immunity.",
        "Meanwhile, the labor market would become more fragile because of additional income loss, particularly for workers in the service sector and the self-employed workers.",
        "Nevertheless, merchandise exports, which improved in all categories and destinations in line with the trading partner economic recovery, would be a major economic driver.",
        "Positive impacts of increased exports on the labor market would be limited, however, since most export firms chose to expand working hours instead of hiring more workers.",
        "In addition, employment in the export sector was small relative to the total labor force.",
        "Meanwhile, the government’s relief and financial measures additionally announced would partly support the economic recovery in the short term.",
        "Fiscal stimulus for the fiscal year 2022 would decelerate somewhat owing to the expedition of budget disbursement under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, B.E.",

        "Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "Looking ahead, there remain significant risks to the Thai economy.",
        "First, the procurement and distribution of vaccines as well as the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination would determine the timing of herd immunity attainment and the re-opening to foreign tourists.",
        "Second, uneven recovery across economic sectors was intensified by the recurring outbreak, causing the labor market to be more vulnerable.",
        "Some workers became unemployed for longer and that could leave scarring effects on the economy.",
        "Third, financial positions, particularly among SMEs and tourism businesses with lower debt servicing capability, became more vulnerable in line with lower income.",
        "Some businesses, already with fragile financial positions caused by the previous outbreak, would now fare worse with inadequate liquidity.",
        "Fourth, a lack of continuity in fiscal support could be another significant risk.",
        "The financial system became more vulnerable due to the negative shocks from the recent outbreak.",
        "Financial positions of Thai households became more fragile as reflected in the elevated debt-to-income ratio which was relatively high compared with other countries.",
        "The majority of household debt was personal consumption loans with high interest rates which resulted in high monthly debt service burden.",
        "In addition, household savings as a share of income declined especially among self-employed workers and employees in the service sector.",
        "This could reduce the household’s ability to cover expenses.",
        "Looking ahead, the Thai economy faced risks from the spread of COVID-19 which would additionally affect income and the already fragile financial positions of borrowers.",
        "This would increase the likelihood of debt at risk that could lead to cross defaults if not properly assisted.",
        "While the impacts from the aforementioned risks on overall financial stability would be limited, there would be a need to monitor the quality of household debt which could further deteriorate as well as the slowdown in credit extended by financial institutions amid high credit risk in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee discussed important measures that should be swiftly implemented in the short and long term as well as the combination of policy tools that would be suitable to the Thai context to achieve the monetary policy objectives.",
        "The details were as follows.",
        "- The Committee viewed that procurement and distribution of vaccines in an adequate and timely manner was the most important issue for Thailand’s economic recovery at the present.",
        "Scenario analysis regarding the amount and speed of vaccination, the timing to achieve herd immunity in Thailand, and the impacts on tourism, the labor market, and economic expansion was conducted.",
        "The results suggested that the acceleration in the procurement and distribution of vaccines would help the economy to expand by an additional 3.0–5.7 percent of GDP during 2021–2022.",
        "If the outbreak could be contained, economic activities and domestic demand would recover fast.",
        "This would help accelerate the re-opening to foreign tourists.",
        "In addition, a sufficient supply of vaccines would reduce the likelihood of another outbreak.",
        "This would help the Thai economy to recover without disruption and support the government to speed up policies to restore the economy to suit the post-COVID-19 environment.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the third wave of outbreak resulted in slower and more uneven economic recovery across sectors.",
        "Despite the gradual recovery in economic activities in the manufacturing sector which had returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, activities in the tourism sector were significantly lower compared with the period before the first-wave outbreak.",
        "In addition, the recovery varied greatly among different labor groups.",
        "Some workers, especially those in the service sector employed in restaurants and retail businesses, could face a longer period of unemployment or leave the workforce.",
        "This would increase the risks of scarring effects on the economy.",
        "Thus, the government should implement measures that are targeted, adequate, and timely to accelerate the recovery and reduce the possibility of economic scars.",
        "Fiscal measures must be adequate and should ensure the continuity of fiscal impulses by expediting the disbursements of relief and government support.",
        "Financial and credit measures should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to and reduce debt burden for businesses and households additionally impacted by the new outbreak in a targeted manner.",
        "This could be achieved through the special loan facility for businesses and asset warehousing.",
        "Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring.",
        "- Financial positions of households became more fragile following the new outbreak, which resulted in decreased income and increased debt burden relative to income.",
        "In the recent period, financial institutions had provided assistance to aid retail borrowers.",
        "institutions to expedite additional assistance to help borrowers.",
        "In the short term measures to help reduce debt burden, generate income, and reduce expenses to enhance liquidity for affected households should be expedited.",
        "For example, the measures should expand the options for debt restructuring tailored to debt servicing ability of the borrowers and increase the channels for credit assistance through Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs) and key non-banks in the retail loan market.",
        "In the long run the expedition of measures to sustainably address the problem of household debt would require cooperation from all parties.",
        "The measures should emphasize preventing excessive debt formation, promoting financial literacy, and expanding the options to reduce debt burden though the refinancing market.",
        "In addition, measures to generate sustainable income and promote long-term savings would also be necessary.",
        "- The Committee viewed that the economic structure and long-term potential growth of the Thai economy would change after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak due to several factors.",
        "For example, the recovery among different sectors would become more uneven, especially for the tourism sector that was severely hit.",
        "In addition, income inequality would increase, some workers would be unemployed for longer, and the financial positions of households and businesses would become more fragile.",
        "Such factors reiterated the need for structural reforms policies to elevate the long-term potential growth of the Thai economy.",
        "Facilitating business model adjustments as well as upskilling and reskilling labor to fit the post-COVID-19 environment, for instance, would support sustainable economic recovery and increase income in the long run.",
        "In addition, coordination among agencies would be required to identify key objectives and establish policy guidelines for both the short and long term in order to support structural transformation as well as to push forward policy implementation.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "As a result, the financial positions of some private sector segments became more fragile, particularly SMEs and households.",
        "Additional measures should thus be more targeted in line with the need and potential prospect of businesses.",
        "The problem facing the Thai economy was less about the level of the policy interest rate, as lending rates and bond yields are already low.",
        "While the overall liquidity in the banking system remained ample, the main challenges were about distributing liquidity in a broad-based manner to businesses and households additionally affected by the new outbreak.",
        "Financial and credit measures, together with credit guarantee mechanisms and expedited debt restructuring, would be the appropriate solution.",
        "These measures would alleviate financial burden in a more targeted manner than cutting the policy rate from the current low level which might provide limited support to the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective The Committee would continue to monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows, as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures to ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Although pressures on the baht would abate in tandem with the projected reduction of the current account surplus in 2021, the Committee would continuously expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem to improve the structure of the Thai foreign exchange markets over the medium term.",
        "The Committee viewed that by encouraging Thai institutional investors to increase their portfolio investments abroad, it would facilitate capital outflows and improve the balance between capital inflows and outflows.",
        "The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among agencies would be critical in restoring the economy.",
        "The procurement and distribution of vaccines should be accelerated to limit the duration of the pandemic and reduce economic costs.",
        "Fiscal measures should ensure sustained fiscal support to alleviate the impact of the outbreak, especially by expediting the approvals and disbursements under the remaining restoration budget.",
        "Monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "The new financial rehabilitation measures to restore businesses affected by COVID-19 should expedite the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner.",
        "This would reduce debt burden and support economic restoration.",
        "Meanwhile, financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring to have broader impacts.",

        "- The Committee assessed that the spike in long-term Thai government bond yields in tandem with the US Treasury long-term yields thus far had limited impact on the Thai economy.",
        "This was because most corporate bond issuers raised funds in the short maturity and could still do so as usual.",
        "Corporate credit spreads continued to decline.",
        "Although yields on long-term Thai government bonds stabilized recently and were less correlated with the US Treasury counterparts, the Committee would closely monitor financial market developments and implications on the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "- The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would recover slowly in the short term and become more uneven among sectors.",
        "Targeted and sufficient government measures should be expedited to reduce economic scars, especially those in the private sector experiencing increasingly fragile financial positions, elevated household debt, and a weakened labor market, all of which would hamper the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Fiscal measures should therefore be helpful in expediting the disbursements of relief and government support to keep the momentum of fiscal stimulus, thereby supporting job creation and generating household incomes.",
        "Financial and credit measures should encourage financial institutions to expedite debt restructuring for both retail borrowers and businesses, as well as support the distribution of liquidity in a targeted manner to reduce the debt burden of the affected groups, particularly through the new financial rehabilitation measures consisting of soft loans and asset warehousing.",
        "The new measures would (1) create incentives for financial institutions to provide liquidity to the businesses in a targeted manner, in line with their needs and prospects and (2) temporarily reduce debt payments of principal and interest for businesses that would take time to recover, especially tourism-related services.",
        "Under the worst case scenario, the government should prepare additional packages of financial and fiscal measures to cushion against uncertainties, especially if the number of inbound foreign tourists in 2021 were lower than expected.",

        "The reforms would support a sustainable economic recovery and increase income that would help speed up the process of business and household debt deleveraging.",
        "- The Committee discussed an appropriate combination of policy tools to support the near-term economic recovery and the long-run sustainable economic expansion.",
        "The views of the Committee were as follows.",
        "First, monetary policy accommodation together with targeted fiscal and financial measures would facilitate the economic recovery and foster the return of headline inflation to target.",
        "Second, macroprudential and microprudential measures would be crucial in the context of low-for-long interest rates to sustain the economic recovery.",
        "Third, the public sector should accelerate structural policies to raise the country’s competitiveness and long-term economic potential.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to expand, albeit somewhat slower than the previous assessment.",
        "Nonetheless, fragile financial positions of some segments of the private sector, particularly SMEs and households, would hinder the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the measures that assist the target groups directly and consistent with their needs.",
        "At the present, the key challenge of the Thai economy was not the level of interest rates since commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields still remained low.",
        "Instead, there was an issue of distributing the ample liquidity within the banking system to those affected businesses and households.",
        "Implementation of financial and credit measures in a targeted manner would then be suitable.",
        "In addition, the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead would remain highly uncertain.",
        "The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing to maximize its effectiveness.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows, as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures to ensure that exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery.",
        "Although pressures on the baht would abate in tandem with the substantial reduction in the current account surplus for 2021, the Committee would continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem to restructure the Thai foreign exchange markets, which directly addresses the root cause of the pressures on the baht.",
        "The Committee viewed that by encouraging Thai institutional investors to increase their portfolio investments abroad, it would facilitate capital outflows and improve the balance between capital inflows and outflows.",
        "The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical in supporting the economic recovery going forward.",
        "The Committee encouraged the expedition of the new financial rehabilitation measures to restore businesses affected by COVID-19.",
        "This would ensure the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic transformation in the period ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring to have broader impacts.",
        "Fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy, especially expediting the approvals and disbursements under the remaining restoration budget.",
        "Furthermore, the government should help accelerate structural reforms to enable business model adjustments and to upskill labor towards the post-COVID environment.",

        "Additional government support could be tied to clearly stated objectives and conditions, such as employment retention or business model adjustments to the postCOVID environment.",

        "External factors which could affect the pace of border reopening included travel restrictions from China and virus mutations that could reduce vaccine efficacy.",
        "Important domestic factors included the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the willingness of the population to take the vaccine, and the ability to control and screen travelers crossing the borders.",
        "- The Committee deemed it important that the public sector should prepare a package of financial and fiscal measures corresponding to risks and economic development for each period going forward, and such policy package should be readily available if necessary.",
        "For instance, in the case that Thailand could not reopen the borders to admit foreign tourists during the peak season from late 2021 to early 2022, the government should prepare fiscal measures and provide additional stimulus to cushion against such uncertainty.",
        "The Committee noted that rising public debt in the medium term would not pose a significant risk to fiscal sustainability.",

        "Additional measures should thus be more targeted in line with the need and potential prospect of businesses.",
        "The problem facing the Thai economy was less about the level of the policy interest rate as lending rates and bond yields were already at a record low.",
        "While the overall liquidity in the banking system remained ample, the main challenge was about distributing liquidity to businesses and households in need sufficiently.",
        "Thus, financial and credit measures such as credit guarantee schemes that reduce credit risks should be enhanced and would be the appropriate solution.",
        "Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the economic recovery remained high.",
        "The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective The Committee viewed that if the baht appreciated rapidly, the economic recovery could be affected.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures to ensure that the exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery.",
        "These could be achieved by reducing pressures on the baht and addressing structural problems in the Thai foreign exchange market through continued efforts in expediting the new foreign exchange ecosystem.",

        "In particular, labor upskilling and infrastructure investment to support the digital economy should be promptly pursued to help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",

        "The spread of the Omicron variant led to the acceleration of vaccine booster rollout in several countries, while some countries reimposed pandemic containment measures but in a more targeted manner.",
        "Advanced economies (AEs) would continue to recover in line with the previous projection.",
        "The Chinese economic expansion would moderate as a result of the zero-COVID policy which restrained consumption, together with the government’s measures to curb imbalances in the property markets which dampened investment.",
        "Asian economies would gradually recover on the back of higher exports, particularly exports of electronics products.",
        "Manufacturing production would expand in line with the continued recovery in global demand and some alleviation in global supply disruptions.",
        "Nevertheless, the outlook for the pandemic situations remained uncertain and would warrant monitoring going forward.",
        "In addition, the global economy would still face the risks from prolonged global supply disruptions and heightened geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine which could reinforce the elevation in energy prices.",
        "Global financial markets were highly volatile due to the anticipation of faster monetary policy normalization of AE central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve.",
        "Government bond yields in many countries rose in tandem with US Treasury yields, while risk asset prices fell.",
        "Movements of the Thai financial markets were in line with the global markets.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields increased.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term and medium-term bond yields were largely unchanged, consistent with the Thai policy rate outlook.",
        "On the exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar remained volatile, while the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated since the previous meeting.",
        "The relaxation of domestic COVID-19 containment measures contributed to upward pressure on the baht, while the prospects of faster policy normalization by the Federal Reserve exerted downward pressure.",
        "In the period ahead, financial market volatilities could increase.",
        "Key risk factors included Reserve, due to persistently high inflation, (2) uncertainties regarding the outbreak and mutations of COVID-19, and (3) geopolitical risks that could prolong the elevation of global energy prices.",
        "The Thai economy in 2021 would expand faster than previously projected, and the recovery would continue into 2022.",
        "This was driven by exports of goods especially automobiles, electronics parts, and electrical appliances, which improved in tandem with the recovering global demand and the easing of global supply disruptions.",
        "Furthermore, foreign tourist arrivals would increase due to the faster-than-expected relaxation of travel restrictions and the return of the ‘Test & Go’ scheme.",
        "However, the recovery would remain fragile and uneven across sectors.",

        "Meanwhile, income had not fully recovered especially for self-employed workers and service sector employees.",
        "The economy in 2023 would continue to expand but would slow down slightly from the previous projection.",
        "This would be partly due to the phasing-out of fiscal stimulus, especially the government consumption which was set to decrease under the Fiscal Year 2023 and 2024 budgets.",
        "Headline inflation in 2022 would be higher than previously assessed and could exceed the target range in the early part of the year.",
        "This would be owing to two particular sector-specific price increases.",
        "First, energy prices (12% share of the CPI basket) increased in tandem with world crude oil prices as a result of (1) the disputes among oil-producing countries, (2) increased demand for crude oil as concerns over the Omicron variant subsided, and (3) heightened geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Second, meat products and prepared food prices (9% and 15% share of the CPI basket, respectively) increased on the back of prices of pork due to the swine epidemic and would take at least ten months to be resolved.",
        "Nevertheless, the average inflation rate for the full year 2022 and medium-term expectations would remain within the target range.",
        "Furthermore, there had not been an indication of broad-based increases in the prices of goods and services.",
        "The proportion of domestic goods and services with above-average prices[1 ]for Thailand stood at 10% of the total basket, compared with that of the US at 35%.",
        "This was partly due to the strong economic expansion in the US, unlike the Thai economy.",

        "Although the spread of the Omicron variant exerted limited pressure on the public health system, there remained a need to closely monitor efficacy of the vaccine and developments of the pandemic situations overall.",
        "COVID-19 containment policies in Thailand and abroad must also be monitored, as they would impact the prospects of foreign tourist arrivals and the recovery of tourism in Thailand.",
        "Domestic private consumption would be lower than previously assessed due to the spread of the Omicron variant and the phasing-out of government support measures.",
        "However, overall domestic consumption would continue to expand in 2023.",
        "The Committee viewed that there remained a need to monitor the inclusiveness of the recovery across sectors and the impact of higher living costs.",

        "- The Committee assessed that upside inflationary risks had increased and headline inflation could exceed the upper bound of the target range of 3% in early 2022.",
        "This was due to the rises in energy and raw food prices.",
        "The risk of a prolonged elevation in global energy prices increased primarily from geopolitical factors.",

        "The Committee viewed that the higher living costs from increased energy and raw food prices had affected households unevenly.",
        "Low-income households faced relatively larger increases in the living costs stemming from food expenditure compared with high-income households (the proportion of food expenditure in the low-income households’ and high-income households’ consumption baskets stood at 45% and 25%, respectively).",
        "Meanwhile, high-income households faced slightly higher increases in the living costs caused by rising energy prices compared with low-income households (the proportion of energy-related expenditure in the low-income households’ and high-income households’ consumption baskets stood at impact on self-employed workers and service sector employees whose incomes were slow to recover compared with other worker groups.",
        "- The Committee viewed that there remained a need to monitor the recovery of the labor market that was fragile and uneven, as well as risks to financial stability in the period ahead.",
        "The recovery of labor income would be slow for the next 1-2 years due to (1) slow tourism recovery, (2) employers limiting the hiring expansion during periods of high uncertainties pertaining to COVID-19 situations, and (3) a portion of workers returning to their home provinces or leaving the labor force permanently.",
        "Such factors delayed the recovery of the economy and the labor market going forward.",

        "The Committee deemed that measures contributing to sustainable debt restructuring should be expedited to mitigate financial stability risks, especially given that household income could potentially be adversely affected by additional shocks going forward.",
        "- The Committee noted that monetary policy divergence could cause volatilities in global financial markets.",
        "AE central banks appeared set to be on a hiking cycle to curb rising inflation as their economies had returned to or exceeded the pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Emerging market (EM) central banks in Latin America were likely to hike interest rates following AE central banks.",
        "Central banks in Latin America faced elevated inflationary pressures, together with local currencies and capital flows that were highly susceptible to external factors due to high levels of external debt.",
        "Meanwhile, unlike AEs and EMs in Latin America, EM central banks in Asia had not faced high inflationary pressures and continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",
        "Monetary policy divergence could lead to volatilities in exchange rates and capital flows.",
        "However, the impact on Thailand’s financial markets was judged to be manageable due to strength on the external stability front, including large international reserves, and the fact that most businesses obtained funding primarily through banks that raised funds through domestic savings.",
        "Therefore, the Thai monetary policy could still pursue all three objectives of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability.",

        "The Committee assessed that the baht relative to the US dollar still exhibited volatile movements.",
        "This was due to faster-than-expected prospects of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, as well as better-than-expected Thai economic outlook owing to the relaxation of domestic containment measures.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",

        "The Committee would stand ready to use appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "In the medium term, the Committee viewed that appropriate monetary policy should consider trade-offs between the objectives of price stability, economic growth, and financial stability in light of the changing outlook and risks.",
        "This should be deliberated in conjunction with the overall assessment of the interaction of monetary policy and other policy tools, as well as their effectiveness.",
        "At the current juncture, accommodative monetary policy reflected the assessment that risks and uncertainties to the economic growth continued to outweigh risks and uncertainties to other policy objectives.",

        "The Chinese economy would also decelerate as a result of stricter containment measures and concerns over the new wave of the outbreak that affected production and freight.",
        "The slowdown would also be attributable to dampened investment following government measures to curb imbalances in property markets and more stringent environmental regulations on certain manufacturing activities.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian economies came under pressure in the previous period as the spread of the Delta variant prompted governments in many countries to re-impose strict containment measures.",

        "Second, the sentiment of the public and businesses could be dampened given multiple waves of outbreaks and high household debt.",
        "Third, government measures to support the economic recovery could be adversely affected in terms of continuity and adequacy.",

        "Although, under the baseline scenario, the Omicron outbreak would not derail the overall Thai economic recovery, the outbreak situation remained highly uncertain and could have larger and more prolonged impacts than expected.",
        "This would depend on the severity of the outbreak and the strictness of the corresponding containment measures.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to expand despite impacts of the Omicron outbreak on domestic spending, foreign tourist figures, and merchandise exports in early 2022.",
        "The Committee also assessed, under the baseline scenario, that although the Omicron variant had a higher transmission rate than the previous variants, the efficacy of existing vaccines would help reduce the severity of the symptoms to some extent.",
        "The government was therefore expected to implement area-specific containment measures and suspend the Test & Go registration for foreign tourists only temporarily.",
        "As a result, the impact on foreign tourist figures in 2022 would be limited, as foreign tourist figures were previously forecasted to begin accelerating only in the second half of 2022.",
        "The tourism sector would thus remain an important economic growth driver and would support the Thai economy to recover to pre-pandemic levels by early 2023.",
        "Under the worse scenario, the Omicron outbreak would be widespread despite efforts to accelerate vaccination rates.",
        "This would create a strain on public health capacity in some areas and prompt the government to impose more stringent containment measures than in the baseline scenario.",
        "Consequently, economic activities would be directly affected in the first half of 2022 via dampened confidence and domestic spending.",
        "Furthermore, international travel restrictions by various countries would result in a sharp fall in Thailand’s foreign tourist figures.",
        "This could impede the recovery of the tourism sector which was a key growth driver, and would thus delay the economic recovery to pre-pandemic levels relative to the baseline scenario.",
        "- The Thai labor markets would take a longer time to return to pre-pandemic levels than the recovery of overall economic activities.",
        "There was thus a need to monitor indicators that reflected the quality of the economic recovery.",
        "The recovery in the period ahead would be uneven across sectors.",
        "Therefore, a broader range of indicators would be needed to reflect the recovery across sectors and income groups, particularly labor market indicators such as the number of unemployed and underemployed workers, as well as income loss.",
        "The Committee assessed that, although the Thai economy was expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, the labor market would remain fragile.",
        "This was reflected by the outlook of non-farm income in 2023 which would still be lower than pre-pandemic levels.",
        "- The COVID-19 outbreak not only caused a severe impact on economic activities in the short run but would also affect Thailand’s potential growth in the long run.",
        "Several factors that could weigh on potential growth included delays in investment given higher uncertainties, difficulties for a large number of workers in adapting to new types of jobs, and the need for businesses to adjust production processes in order to reduce risks from the outbreak.",
        "Another factor was a reduction in reliance on potentially fragile supply chains due to production disruptions by focusing on the continuity of production processes rather than the increase in production efficiency.",
        "Such long-run impacts must also be considered when evaluating the economic shortfall relative to potential.",
        "- Thailand’s inflation would increase temporarily in line with global energy prices and would be within the target.",
        "However, there remained a need to closely monitor dynamics of global and domestic inflation.",
        "The Committee noted that Thailand’s inflation would rise due mainly to supply-side factors, especially energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic inflationary pressures remained low compared to those of other countries due to the following reasons.",
        "First, the Thai economy had just recovered from a series of outbreaks unlike other economies that had already recovered to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in relatively low demand pressures.",
        "Second, Thai businesses had not passed on the higher production costs to consumer prices widely enough to cause wage increases, which were a key driver of the second-round effect like what happened in some emerging markets in Latin America.",
        "This was because most businesses in Thailand at present decided not to adjust their prices and instead absorbed the higher costs themselves owing to weak purchasing power of Thai consumers.",
        "Third, price administration by the government helped reduce cost-push pressures to some extent.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that inflation in the period ahead would be subject to upside risks owing to fast rising global inflation and higher cost pass-through.",
        "If the spread of the Omicron variant prolonged global supply disruptions further, while global energy prices remained high for an extended period, overall production costs would increase, putting pressures on businesses to pass on higher costs and quickly increase prices.",
        "This would consequently put upward pressures on inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "Therefore, factors that would influence Thailand’s inflation dynamics should be closely monitored.",
        "- The Committee viewed that policy coordination among government agencies were critical to ensure that the economic recovery remained intact.",
        "This was because the recovery going forward would be highly uncertain due to several factors including after the phase-out of government measures, and (3) cost pass-through from higher global energy prices in case natural gas and oil prices were to remain high for longer than anticipated.",
        "These factors could hinder the economic recovery going forward, and the Committee would thus closely monitor and assess these risks to the economy.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee emphasized the importance of expediting debt consolidation and debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021.",
        "This would address the debt overhang problem in a targeted and practical manner, lowering risk to economic growth in the medium term.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to expand due to domestic spending and a gradual improvement in foreign tourist figures.",
        "Meanwhile, the recovery in various business sectors was expected to improve in line with economic activities.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Omicron outbreak would affect the economy in early 2022.",
        "The impact could be more severe and prolonged than expected due to downside risks such as the severity of the outbreak and the strictness of corresponding containment measures.",

        "The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",
        "In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth, would play an important role in bolstering the robust recovery of The volatility of the baht relative to the US dollar remained high due to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation that could escalate as well as monetary policy in advanced economies amid high inflationary pressures.",

        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "In the medium term, the Committee viewed that appropriate monetary policy should be considered in an integrated manner, taking into account interaction among monetary policy tools and trade-offs among policy objectives of price stability, economic growth, and financial system stability in light of the economic outlook and potential risks.",
        "At the current juncture, accommodative monetary policy reflected the assessment that risks to the economic growth were higher than risks to other policy objectives.",
        "In the period ahead when economic growth returned to normal and the associated risks subsided, relative importance of policy objectives should be reassessed in line with the evolving situation, especially in the case of increasing risks to the inflation outlook and financial system stability.",

        "In January 2020, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) reduced the reserve requirement ratio policy rate further to foster economic growth.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a probability of trading partner’s economic growth being lower than the previous assessment due mainly to (1) the coronavirus outbreak that could widely spread to other countries and their impacts could extend from private consumption and tourism to manufacturing sector and international trade, (2) high uncertainties of trade protectionist measures regarding the further actions of the US and China following the phase one trade deal, which warranted monitoring as it could affect international trade and trade negotiation going forward, (3) uncertainties pertaining to trade deal after Brexit, and (4) geopolitical risks that could be intensified and prolonged, particularly recurring protests in several countries.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to monitor developments in the trading partner economies, together with the risks mentioned above, and closely evaluate their impacts on the Thai economy that could occur through various linkages.",
        "Despite a slightly improved confidence following the agreement between the US and China over the phase one trade deal, there were rising concerns in the global financial markets over the short term owing to the coronavirus outbreak.",

        "The Committee viewed that the financial markets would remain highly uncertain going forward due to various factors including the coronavirus outbreak, risks that the trade protectionism could reintensify and be further widespread, geopolitical risks, and Thai economic slowdown.",
        "These factors could cause volatilities in Thai asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to continue to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows.",
        "The Thai economy in 2020 would expand at a much lower rate than the previous forecast and much further below its potential due to the coronavirus outbreak, the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought, all of which would affect a large number of related businesses and employment.",
        "Exports of services would be much lower than the previous forecast following a significant drop in tourist figures and tourism receipts mainly due to the Chinese government’s prohibition on Chinese outbound group tours after the outbreak of coronavirus.",
        "Merchandise exports would decline in line with trading partner economies and potential impacts of regional supply chain disruptions due to a temporary production halt in China such as electronics and automotive industries.",
        "Public expenditure would grow at a lower rate than previously assessed due to a further delay with increased uncertainty in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act.",
        "Private consumption would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed in tandem with more restrained household income in service, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors.",
        "The household income was negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak, declining exports, the more-severe-than-expected drought, and elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment was expected to slow down.",
        "Business confidence was affected by the delay in the Annual Budget Expenditure Act.",
        "Financial institutions became more cautious in extending business loans amid economic slowdown with additional pressures from a slowdown in private consumption and tourism.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding major risk factors to the Thai economy and an assessment of the impacts of those risks in each scenario through various linkages.",
        "Such major risk factors included, first, the coronavirus outbreak that remained highly uncertain as it could become rapidly widespread and prolonged.",
        "This would in turn pose larger-than-expected impact on the Thai economy, particularly for businesses and employment in tourism sector.",
        "In addition, there was a risk that Chinese group tours could be prohibited to travel abroad much longer.",
        "In case the outbreak were to be well-contained, and the recovery in tourist figures would still take time.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee viewed that Wuhan was a major transport hub and manufacturing center for some industries such as steel, automotive, and electronics.",
        "Factory shutdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities since Chinese New Year holiday could lead to supply chain disruption and could have knock-on effects on the recovery of electronics cycle and Thai export sector.",
        "Second, the further- delayed-than-expected enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act would affect operations and liquidity of relevant businesses, especially construction companies.",
        "Third, the drought that could be more severe than expected would affect purchasing power of agricultural households.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor developments of the abovementioned risk factors which remained highly uncertain and to assess the impacts on the Thai economy through each channel.",
        "The annual averages of headline inflation in 2020 and 2021 were projected to be lower than the lower bound of the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon due to moderating core inflation following subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "In addition, energy prices were projected to be lower than expected owing to declining oil demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while fresh food prices were expected to increase slightly due to the drought.",
        "Core and headline inflations remained subject to downside risks in line with risks to the economy.",
        "There were more vulnerabilities in the financial system due to the slowing economy which led to negative income shocks for both businesses and household.",
        "Risks in the period ahead increased owing to the coronavirus outbreak, the delayed government spending, and the intensifying drought.",
        "Major risks were as follows.",
        "(1) Debt serviceability where medium-sized SMEs were found to have deteriorating loan quality in addition to small-sized SMEs which had been highly vulnerable owing to existing structural problems.",
        "Meanwhile, the impacts on businesses that relied on Chinese demand and tourism sector warranted close monitoring.",
        "Regarding household debt, the household debt-to-GDP ratio remained elevated and would continue to edge up as a result of the economic slowdown as well as credit card and personal loan growth where household increasingly resorted to collateralized personal loans for liquidity.",
        "(2) Search-for-yield behavior that led to underpricing of risks still persisted in the lower-for- longer interest rate environment.",
        "Large corporates increasingly shifted their funding to the bond market instead of bank loans during the low interest rate environment, with commercial banks becoming cautious in extending loans.",
        "As a result, both corporates and investors could underprice risks.",
        "Regarding saving cooperatives, assets held by a large saving cooperative, who served as an intermediary for taking deposits and extending loans, grew at a higher rate as its deposit rates were higher than those of commercial banks and those deposits were invested more in financial assets.",
        "(3) Risks in the property sector decreased despite a need to continue monitoring the oversupply.",
        "The speculation in the property sector would abate.",
        "Financial institutions extended mortgage loans with tighter credit standard.",
        "Some developers adjusted by delaying new project launches, but some still launched new projects.",
        "Hence, oversupply and time-togo still rose.",
        "Moreover, some developers mainly relied on bond market for funds.",
        "These developers’ remaining credit lines with commercial banks were also limited.",
        "Thus, there was a need to monitor rollover risks especially for non-investment grade or unrated bonds.",
        "Meanwhile, the recent implementation of monetary and fiscal measures would help reduce the oversupply in the property sector to some extent.",
        "Such measures were the reduction of transfer fees and mortgage registration fees for new housing units under three million baht, a 50,000-baht cash rebate program for homebuyers (the Baan Dee Mee Down scheme), and The Committee viewed that the previously implemented macroprudential measures helped curb vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent.",
        "The Committee saw a need to continue monitoring and assessing the impacts of LTV measure on the property sector, financing by large corporates that might underprice risks, and risks associated with the large saving cooperative who served as an intermediary for taking deposits and extending loans.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that household debt was a critical and urgent risk that would require a multi-dimensional resolution.",
        "Cooperation between various parties was needed to reduce leverage and to restructure existing debt.",
        "In this light, greater emphasis should be placed on borrowers’ debt serviceability and adequate residual income to cover their costs of living.",
        "The Committee thus directed an exploration of debt to service ratio (DSR) data to examine the impacts of the abovementioned risks and to study holistic measures to address the household debt problem.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower rate in 2020 than previous projection and much further below its potential.",
        "Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "Financial stability became more vulnerable due to the modest growth outlook.",
        "In this situation, there was an urgent need to coordinate monetary and fiscal measures.",
        "The Committee viewed that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would alleviate the negative impacts.",
        "A more accommodative monetary policy would also support liquidity provision and debt restructuring for businesses and households severely affected from these negative impacts that should be urgently implemented and materialized.",
        "The Committee therefore voted unanimously to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.25 to 1.00 percent.",
        "In this regard, some Committee members viewed that extra accommodative monetary policy at this juncture would be appropriate to support the Thai economic growth and to facilitate the rise of headline inflation toward the target range amid downside risks and heightened uncertainties arising from both external and domestic factors.",
        "However, the need for extra accommodative monetary policy would gradually reduce going forward should the developments of the economic outlook continue to gain traction, impacts resulting from aforementioned uncertainties turn out to be less than expected, and headline inflation trajectory become consistent with the inflation target.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning the policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "1) The Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate in 2020 than the previous forecast and much further below its potential due to the coronavirus outbreak, the delay in the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought that would affect a large number of related businesses and employment.",
        "Tourist figures were expected to reduce from the previous forecast.",
        "Exports of goods would decline in line with trading partner economies and the potential impacts of regional supply chain disruptions.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, the public expenditure would grow at a slower rate owing to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, which remained subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Furthermore, private consumption would be restrained by moderating household income in the services, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors as well as by elevated household debt, which would deteriorate households’ capability to withstand negative income shocks compared to the past that labors could move from adversely affected sectors to more resilient sector, or could borrow to cover liquidity shortage.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would encounter uncertainties from both external and domestic factors going forward, including (1) the coronavirus outbreak that could intensify and be prolonged which would consequently affect the manufacturing sector and exports, particularly as a result of further delayed recovery of the electronics cycle, (2) uncertain trade tensions and geopolitical risks that could dampen the economic outlook of trading partners, the economy, including the progress of important public-private partnership infrastructure investment projects and their knock-on effects on private investment, (4) risks from drought which might be more severe than expected and affect agricultural output and farm income, as well as increasing costs of water supply management in some areas, and (5) lower-than-expected private consumption due to a decline in household income and employment.",
        "The Committee remained concerned that the baht might not be consistent with economic fundamentals as the baht continuously appreciated against trading partner currencies last year, and would likely remain volatile despite the recent depreciation compared with trading partner currencies.",
        "The Committee thus saw the need to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows amid high external uncertainties as well as the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows, which were previously implemented exporters to keep more foreign currency proceeds overseas, allowing retail investors to invest in foreign securities directly and allowing life insurance companies to invest more in foreign measures alongside efforts to stimulate investment and imports to reduce large current account surplus.",
        "2) Headline inflation would be below the lower bound of the inflation target in 2019 and 2020 due to moderating core inflation following subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures in tandem with an economic outlook, lower-than-expected energy prices owing to declined oil demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.",
        "However, fresh food prices were expected to increase slightly due to the drought.",
        "The Committee viewed that inflation projection would face uncertainties form oil price fluctuations and weather conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the medium-term inflation expectations were unaffected by the new inflation target specifying headline inflation within the range of 1-3 percent as it was well-anchored at around 2 percent.",
        "3) Some financial system risks had been partly addressed by the implemented macroprudential measures.",
        "For instance, property sector risks abated after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure.",
        "This was reflected by moderation in speculation and adjustments of developers.",
        "However, there were more vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially related to debt servicing capability of households and SMEs due to the prospect of economic slowdown.",
        "Moreover, other financial stability risks had yet to improve and thus warranted continued monitoring.",
        "First, the household debt remained at a high level, partly due to structural problems stemming from households’ leveraging behavior and financial institutions’ business practice.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks, especially by large corporates and saving cooperatives.",
        "Third, the property sector remained oversupplied in some areas.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy interest rate, along with microprudential and macroprudential measures, should be combined at the appropriate timing to ensure financial stability.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding the necessity of the policy rate cut to 1.00 percent at this meeting and viewed that both external and domestic uncertainties remained high and were expected to pose significant impacts on economic growth, headline inflation, as well as financial stability associated with debt servicing capability of households and SMEs in particular.",
        "Moreover, such risks occurred simultaneously.",
        "The Committee thus viewed that the policy rate cut in this meeting was timely and appropriate without a need to wait until these risks became fully materialized and thus more difficult to cope with.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy rate cut in this meeting might not lend much additional support to economic growth but would rather reduce the debt burden and support liquidity provision.",
        "Monetary policy accommodation would need to be pursued in combination with other targeted monetary and fiscal measures in order to effectively alleviate the impacts from negative shocks.",
        "Such measures that were needed to urgently implement included (1) liquidity provision measures that financial institutions assisted clients who were affected by the coronavirus outbreak, such as principal repayment suspension, interest reduction and additional loan provision, and (2) debt restructuring measure, such as pre-emptive debt restructuring for SMEs to enhance their debt servicing capability and to keep their businesses operating, as well as the third phase of debt clinic.",
        "In the period ahead, the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with other associated risks, especially the coronavirus outbreak, the delay in the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need for policy coordination between related public and private organizations to support an economic recovery and to restructure the economy, given structural problems facing the Thai economy that could affect competitiveness and growth outlook going forward.",
        "The problems should be firmly addressed by all related parties.",
        "Trading partner economies would severely contract this year and could take longer time to recover than previously assessed, as the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures had larger-than-expected impacts on economic activities, although some economies began to exhibit signs of improvement following the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "Advanced and Asian economies (excluding China) would contract deeply this year and enter recession mainly due to significant weakening manufacturing activities, employment, and consumption.",
        "Some countries were still facing a growing number of COVID-19 cases or the second wave of the outbreak after relaxing the containment measures.",
        "China would exhibit a modest growth on the back of gradual improvement in economic activities following the containment measures relaxation.",
        "Over the recent period, countries worldwide promptly implemented additional accommodative financial and fiscal measures to shore up economic activities in the short term.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, advanced economy central banks continued to maintain their policy rates at ultra-low levels.",
        "Many central banks, for example, the Federal Reserve (Fed), the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England (BOE) expanded asset purchases programs.",
        "Meanwhile, several regional central banks, such as the Bank of Korea and Bank Indonesia, further cut their policy rates.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, governments worldwide announced additional relief measures for the affected businesses and households.",
        "Many countries would continue to implement accommodative monetary policy and announce additional fiscal measures to support the economic recovery.",
        "Nonetheless, fiscal policy implementation in several advanced economies could be constrained by smaller fiscal policy space as reflected in a historically high public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian countries still had fiscal policy space to further stimulate economies.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a likelihood of trading partner economies expanding less than the baseline assessment due to (1) the COVID-19 outbreak that could be intensifying or re-emerging in some countries, leading to the re-imposing of the containment measures in several countries, (2) vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased default or downgrade risks among private sector and governments in some countries, (3) re-intensifying trade tensions between the US and China, and (4) geopolitical risks, for example tensions between Mainland China and Hong Kong.",
        "The Committee assessed that trading partner economies would contract most significantly in the second quarter of 2020 and would gradually recover afterward.",
        "However, the recovery outlook remained highly uncertain and depended on several factors, such as the likelihood and severity of the second wave of the outbreak, the progress of developing successful and widely-available vaccines, as well as the effectiveness of public measures in facilitating the recovery and stimulating the economy going forward.",
        "The Committee thus deemed it necessary to closely monitor such factors as they were significant to the Thai economic recovery.",
        "Increasingly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies worldwide, ample liquidity in the global financial markets, and signs of improvement in economic activities contributed to the risk-on sentiment among foreign investors as reflected in rising prices of risky assets.",
        "Nonetheless, there remained concerns that risk assessment in the financial markets might be inconsistent with the economic slowdown and the sharp falls in business earnings, which could result in market correction in the period ahead.",
        "Emerging markets started experiencing inflows in the debt and equity markets, especially Asian countries—including Thailand—that effectively contained the COVID-19 outbreak and exhibited less economic vulnerabilities relative to other regions.",
        "Meanwhile, short-term government bond yields declined following the previous policy rate cut, while commercial bank lending and deposit rates also decreased.",
        "The long-term government bond yields moved in line with the US counterparts and in tandem with the economic data, outbreak situation, and the progress of vaccine development.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor volatilities in global financial markets in light of the second wave of the outbreak in many countries.",
        "Corporate bond markets became more stabilized but corporate bond spreads remained high, reflecting credit risks and financing costs.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor the risks arising from corporate bonds especially those issued by businesses severely affected by the COVID-19, which could be downgraded to non-investment grade.",
        "Regarding corporate financing through financial institutions, commercial bank loans expanded due to large corporates borrowing as a liquidity buffer for economic uncertainties as well as to substitute for debt financing where costs increased.",
        "Meanwhile, SME and consumer loans decelerated.",
        "The Committee viewed that the level of overall liquidity in the financial system remained ample.",
        "However, it was deemed important that liquidity be better distributed to On exchange rates, the US dollar depreciated against major currencies in line with the risk-on sentiment and partially due to selling pressures on the US dollar earned from the exports of gold whose prices increased due to the COVID-19 situation.",
        "Consequently, the baht appreciated against the US dollar and regional currencies, and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated.",
        "Looking ahead, global financial markets would remain volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic outlook that would be subject to risks and uncertainties.",
        "The Committee expressed concerns over the baht that strengthened and could affect the economic recovery.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets, the progress of capital outflows relaxation measures, as well as assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures.",
        "The Thai economy would contract this year more than the previous assessment due to the more-severe-than-expected COVID-19 pandemic which prompted governments in many countries including Thailand to implement containment measures.",
        "Consequently, global economic activities were sharply disrupted, affecting business operations and the way of life that could alter economic structure going forward.",
        "Merchandise exports would markedly contract in the second quarter of 2020 in line with the outlook of trading partner economies and global trade volume.",
        "Businesses were also impacted by disruptions of supply chain and shipping routes.",
        "Nonetheless, merchandise exports would gradually improve from the third quarter of 2020 onward on the back of external demand after the gradual relaxation of containment measures in many countries.",
        "Exports of services would significantly contract in tandem with a sharp decline in foreign tourist figures throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "Nonetheless, recovery in foreign tourist figures would depend on confidence in Thailand’s ability to manage the outbreak situations and the process of re-opening the country under the travel bubble scheme.",
        "Private consumption would contract more than previously assessed, and the recovery would be limited.",
        "This was due to weakening employment, rising unemployment, deceleration in labor income following the business adjustment to the outbreak, as well as high household debt which caused households to become cautious in their spending.",
        "These factors weighed on private consumption, although the government’s relief and liquidity support measures, together with gradual relaxation of the containment measures, could somewhat help shore up household consumption.",
        "Regarding private investment, investor confidence declined.",
        "Excess capacity remained high in several business sectors.",
        "Most entrepreneurs postponed or delayed their investment to preserve liquidity for business operations.",
        "However, some investment projects would likely continue in the period ahead, particularly large-scale infrastructure investment and infrastructure investment to support the digital economy.",
        "Public expenditure would be a major economic driver.",
        "It would expand further due to (1) disbursement under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic and (2) the increase in the proportion of current expenditure in the government’s budget that could result in faster disbursement thanks to the Budget Expenditure Transfer Bill and the revision of the fiscal year The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract by 8.1 percent in 2020 but would expand at 5.0 percent in 2021 in tandem with a gradual improvement in both domestic and external demand.",
        "Nonetheless, economic growth remained subject to several risks, such as the global economy that could contract more or recover more slowly than expected, debt servicing capability of businesses and households that would significantly deteriorate, as well as the likelihood and severity of the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak should the country re-open under the travel bubble scheme.",
        "The Committee discussed extensively about the economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Despite signs of improvement in economic activities following the relaxation of containment measures, the Committee’s concerns were as follows.",
        "First, industries were severely affected with persistently high levels of excess capacity.",
        "Those industries had to adjust business operations patterns to the post-COVID environment.",
        "Second, the labor market was more severely and extensively affected than expected.",
        "Labors in each economic sector would be affected differently.",
        "Newly graduated workers, aging workers, or unskilled workers would, in particular, likely to be highly affected and find it difficult to return to the labor market.",
        "This would be more pronounced at the time when businesses employ more digital technology or automation to replace workers in production process.",
        "These factors would weigh on non-farm income and employment to recover slowly, while the employment might not return to the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Thus, the Committee viewed that the government needed to accelerate the implementation of (1) additional supply-side policies to support the changing economic structure and patterns of business operations in the post-COVID environment, as well as (2) labor policies to enhance employment and labor skills simultaneously to maintain long-term potential growth.",
        "Headline inflation would be more negative in 2020 than previously assessed mainly due to sharply declined energy prices in line with decreasing demand following dampened global economic activities and excess capacity.",
        "In addition, a fall in headline inflation was partly due to government measures to reduce electricity and water bills.",
        "Core inflation would remain low in line with demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "The Committee projected headline inflation to be negative at -1.7 percent in 2020 and core inflation to be stable around zero percent.",
        "Nonetheless, headline inflation would rise toward target in 2021 mainly due to gradually rising crude oil prices and the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee viewed that the projection of negative headline inflation did not imply that Thailand was facing deflation risk at present.",
        "First, overall prices of goods and services would not persistently contract.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to rise toward target in 2021.",
        "Second, prices of goods and services contracted only in some categories.",
        "Prices of around 70 percent of goods and services in the inflation basket increased or remained stable.",
        "This was in contrast to the case of deflation where prices of most goods and services contracted.",
        "Third, the public medium-term headline inflation expectations remained anchored within target.",
        "According to the most recent survey of professional forecasters in April 2020, five-year-ahead headline inflation expectation was at 1.8 percent.",
        "Nonetheless, the Committee saw a need to monitor and assess whether demand and employment would not become persistently subdued after the relaxation of the containment measures.",
        "The Committee would monitor factors hinged on private consumption and investment including incomes, employment, as well as household and business confidence.",
        "The Committee would also continue to communicate with the public regarding the outlook of inflation and deflation risk.",
        "The Thai financial system became more vulnerable due to the more-than-expected contraction of the economic outlook in light of the COVID-19 situation, which could lead to (1) sharp correction of asset prices in global financial markets, (2) defaults by businesses and households in many countries including Thailand, and (3) corporate bonds being downgraded to non-investment grade.",
        "Additionally, the Committee deemed it important to prepare financial measures to continuously alleviate impacts on household and business borrowers especially after the phase-outs of the batch of financial and credit measures.",
        "The design of additional measures should take into account the differences among various groups of households and businesses, since they possessed varying degrees of recovery potential.",
        "This would facilitate effective adjustments in the economy.",
        "The Committee assessed that the overall financial institution system remained sound.",
        "Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels, capable of absorbing of relief measures to assist retail borrowers affected by COVID-19 and expedited commercial banks’ proactive debt restructuring for households and businesses, to the extent that the results are substantial, and credit extension under various measures previously announced.",
        "The Committee also deemed it necessary for the Bank of Thailand and other related regulatory agencies to prepare measures for coping with increasing risks if debt servicing capability of borrowers were to deteriorate significantly more than expected.",
        "Some examples included the establishment of mechanisms to standardize and expedite multi-creditor debt restructuring, as well as expanding roles of asset management companies (AMCs) in warehousing non-performing loans to be appropriately managed.",
        "The Committee viewed that the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and the containment measures on the Thai economy turned out more severe than expected and would also create uncertainties on the way of life, business operations, and the economic structure in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee assessed that the monetary policy stance had been eased in a timely manner since the outbreak took place, with three policy rate cuts to a record low.",
        "Moreover, the temporary reduction in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution along helped alleviate adverse impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided.",
        "These measures would also facilitate the return of inflation to the target and help reduce financial stability risks.",
        "The Committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent and would monitor and assess the effectiveness of the previously implemented measures before implementing additional measures.",
        "Some members deemed it important to examine the possible impacts of an ultra-low policy rate on the functioning of financial intermediaries, and on savings and investment behavior, both of which could affect longer-term financial stability.",
        "Given the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, some members thus deemed it necessary to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the appropriate and most effective timing.",
        "The Committee viewed that targeted and timely fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy, as well as credit measures and acceleration of debt restructuring remained vital to support economic recovery.",
        "Financial measures going forward needed to place importance on the acceleration of credit extension under various measures, (2) committing to accelerating debt restructuring for borrowers, and (3) preparing additional measures to lessen solvency risks for businesses, promoting the warehousing of non-performing loans to be appropriately managed, and establishing processes to standardize and expedite multi-creditor debt restructuring.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee viewed that fiscal policy would still have capacity to restore and restructure the economy and that the government need to focus on supply-side policies to support economic restructuring after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, since businesses in each sector would face varying manners of recovery and challenges for the adjustments.",
        "The government would need to (1) establish mechanisms to manage excess capacity in industries such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions between businesses with substantial excess capacity or adjustments of business models to the post-COVID environment, (2) design policies to support and enhance the competitiveness of high-potential target industries with fast recovery potential, infrastructure for the digital economy, (4) facilitate reskilling and upskilling of labor to support employment in target industries and adjustments to the post-COVID environment, and adjustments of businesses to the new economic landscape.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit measures in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate policy tools if necessary.",
        "The global economic recovery was better than expected in the third quarter but significant risks remained regarding new waves of COVID-19 infections going forward.",
        "Over the recent period, advanced economies recovered on the back of private consumption while Asian economies (excluding China) recovered from better-than-expected exports.",
        "China was expected to display moderate growth, following a broad-based improvement of economic activities.",
        "However, the new waves of the pandemic in many countries – the US and Europe in particular – led governments to re-impose lockdowns in some areas.",
        "The economic impacts were, nonetheless, expected to be less severe than the first lockdown since economic activities in several sectors, especially those related to manufacturing, continued to operate.",
        "Many countries continued to use accommodative monetary policy in order to support economic recoveries.",
        "For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England cut the policy rates or expanded asset purchases programs.",
        "Meanwhile, fiscal policy remained the key policy tool and would play a more prominent role in supporting economic recoveries.",
        "Governments in many countries announced additional fiscal measures, either to cope with the new waves of the outbreak or to restore economic activities.",
        "Emerging markets (EMs) experienced greater capital flows into debt and equity markets, following the risk-on sentiment in the global financial markets due to several factors, including expectations toward the president-elect’s economic policies, which would benefit recovery in global trade, and (2) the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development, which positively improved investor sentiment.",
        "Capital inflows induced higher asset prices in EMs, especially in Asia, including Thailand, which managed to contain the COVID-19 outbreak while receiving benefits from the China’s economic recovery.",
        "With regard to the Thai bond market, capital inflows were mainly for short-term bond investment.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht appreciated rapidly against the US dollar over the recent period on the back of improved investor confidence regarding the global economy and greater capital inflows reinvesting in the debt and equity markets.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy would continue to recover despite negative shocks from the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "Meanwhile, the risk-on sentiment in the global financial markets would continue and cause capital flows to be volatile, with funds likely investing in assets in EMs, including Thailand.",
        "The Thai economy in the third quarter of 2020 improved more than expected in almost all components.",
        "However, the recovery would remain slow and vary significantly among economic sectors.",
        "Major improvement was seen in private consumption which improved due to various factors, namely, relaxation of lockdown measures, better-than-expected improvement in the labor market, and the government’s measures that partially helped shore up household purchasing power.",
        "Nonetheless, private consumption still faced several downside risks including fragile and highly uncertain household incomes as well as elevated household debt.",
        "Merchandise exports edged up more than expected in line with the outlook of trading partner economies.",
        "Public expenditure improved due to accelerated disbursement of capital expenditure budget.",
        "However, going forward, overall public spending was projected to expand at a slower rate for several reasons.",
        "These included a reduction in state-owned enterprise investment, a reduction in fiscal year 2021 annual budget and the carryover budget, as well as a potential delay in disbursement of public health programs under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic.",
        "Looking ahead, risks to the Thai economy remained and could arise from (1) domestic political uncertainties which could affect consumer and investor confidences, (2) the progress of protocols in admitting foreign tourists in Thailand, which would likely be gradual depending on situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in foreign countries, along with the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development, and (3) heightened vulnerabilities in financial positions of households and businesses, following the phase-out of the supporting measures.",
        "Headline inflation in 2020 would be less negative than the previous assessment in line with increasing energy prices, as demand rose after the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "Core inflation would remain at a low level.",
        "However, given the economic recovery, headline inflation would gradually rise and stay close to the lower bound of the target range in 2021.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "The gradual and uneven economic recovery could affect financial stability in the period ahead.",
        "Financial positions of business were more fragile, particularly for tourism-related businesses as their economic activities remained much lower than the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Meanwhile, SMEs had limited access to credits due to higher credit risks.",
        "Households remained vulnerable given high household debt and the slow recovery in income, which deteriorated their debt servicing capability.",
        "Nevertheless, credit assistance measures partially relieved liquidity constraints of businesses and households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The Committee placed emphasis on the continuity of the economic recovery, which remained highly uncertain, and discussed various risks that could affect the recovery.",
        "Risks included development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, rapid appreciation of the baht, household debt problems, the slow recovery of income, as well as policy coordination among public agencies.",
        "- Development and widespread distribution of the vaccines were vital for the Thai economic recovery next year.",
        "Progress in development and distribution would affect investor confidence, global economic recovery, readiness and demand for international travels, and protocols for admitting foreign tourists in Thailand.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor the progress of vaccine development and distribution.",
        "- Rapid appreciation of the baht would affect the fragile economic recovery through eroding profitability of exporters that would in turn affect investment and employment.",
        "The baht faced short-term challenges from capital inflows to EMs, including Thailand, due to continued monetary policy easing in many countries as well as risk-on sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "The Committee assessed that, although the potential benefits of positive news on the COVID-19 vaccine and economic policies of the US president-elect had yet to be realized, capital inflows resulted in the baht appreciation that could weigh on the economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "In addition, long-term structural challenges of low investment which caused high and persistent current account surplus, together with the home bias behavior of Thai investors would continuously add pressures for the baht to appreciate.",
        "The Committee thus deemed appropriate to consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures for both the short and long terms.",
        "- The rising household debt-to-GDP ratio and the slow recovery in income would delay deleveraging process which would have adverse impacts on consumption and economic growth in the medium term.",
        "Debt restructuring and economic restructuring should thus be accelerated to support the recovery in incomes in the post-COVID environment.",
        "Furthermore, uneven recovery in income among sectors would result in worsening inequality problems and would limit sustainable economic growth in the long term.",
        "- Policy coordination among public agencies would have an important role in distributing liquidity to those in need in a targeted manner such as the coordination of credit and The Committee viewed that commercial banks, specialized financial institutions, and Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation, all played crucial roles in curbing credit risks.",
        "This would help facilitate a broader distribution of ample liquidity in the system and support business adjustment to the post-COVID environment.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support economic recovery while placing emphasis on the use of more targeted measures.",
        "The Committee assessed that despite the recent better-than-expected outturn, the Thai economy would recover slowly and need support from the continued low policy rate.",
        "Nonetheless, the policy rate was currently at a historical low level while the economic recovery remained fragile and highly uncertain.",
        "The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the appropriate and most The Committee expressed concerns over the rapid appreciation of the baht as this affected the fragile economic recovery.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures to ensure that the exchange rate movements would not be an obstacle to economic recovery.",
        "By reducing pressures on the baht and addressing structural problems in the Thai foreign exchange market, capital flows would become more balanced.",
        "Such measures included, for instance, relaxation of regulation for investment in foreign securities both in terms of investment limits and the scope of products as well as allowing Thais to freely open foreign currency deposit (FCD).",
        "The Committee viewed that policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner.",
        "Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring to have a broader impact.",
        "A fiscal measures continued to play a major role in shoring up the economy, the government should thus accelerate budget disbursement and assist vulnerable target groups.",
        "Several members mentioned challenges for the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead as the post-COVID environment would result in changing business structures in many industries.",
        "Implementation of supply-side policies should therefore be accelerated to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, and regulatory reform should be rapidly pursued to eliminate any hindrance to adjustments of businesses to the post-COVID environment.",
        "These would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, including domestic political uncertainties, the progress of protocols for admitting foreign tourists, and financial positions of businesses and households, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "The global economic recovery was better than expected in the third quarter of 2020 but uncertainties pertaining to the new waves of COVID-19 infections remained.",
        "However, the Committee assessed that the less strict containment measures would adversely affect the global economy less severely than before.",
        "Meanwhile, governments in various countries worldwide continued to conduct fiscal and monetary policies to support economic recoveries.",
        "The global financial market sentiment remained risk-on.",
        "Prices of risky assets, especially oil and emerging market assets, rose worldwide.",
        "Emerging markets continued to experience capital inflows to equity and bond markets, particularly equity markets in Asia.",
        "However, investor confidence subsequently declined following the new waves of infections and news regarding the new COVID-19 mutation.",
        "Regarding Thai financial markets, capital flows recorded net inflows, seen particularly in the equity market, causing Thailand’s stock market index to outperform others in the region.",
        "This recent outperformance was due partly to the smaller prior increases relative to regional peers.",
        "Government bond yields declined across all tenors driven by demand from domestic investors.",
        "Moreover, short-term government bond yields were pressured by limited supply.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht appreciated against the US dollar in line with regional and emerging market currencies mainly due to the weakening of the US dollar.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) was stable from the previous meeting.",
        "Looking ahead, global risk-on sentiment was expected to continue and would cause more volatile and larger capital flows into emerging markets, including Thailand, than previously.",
        "The US dollar was expected to depreciate on the back of the new US president’s trade policies which would likely be more compromising, as well as the progress in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in several countries.",
        "Nevertheless, the baht depreciation over the recent period owing to the new wave of coronavirus cases in Thailand could result in exchange rate volatility in the period ahead.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to continue to recover but uncertainties remained high in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee estimated that the Thai economy would contract 6.6 percent in 2020, which was better than previously assessed, and would expand at 3.2 percent in 2021 and 4.8 percent in 2022[1/].",
        "The Committee assessed that overall economic activities would return to the pre-pandemic level in the second half of 2022.",
        "Key positive factors underlying the revision of the baseline forecast included, first, better-than-expected economic outturns in the third quarter and the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2020, as seen especially in private consumption and merchandise exports.",
        "The second factor underpinning the economic recovery was the continued improvement in the labor market, as reflected in indicators such as the declining numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers[2/].",
        "The number of underemployed workers was 2.2 million in November 2020, down from the peak of 5.4 million in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Such improvement would help support private consumption going forward.",
        "Third, the continued economic recovery of trading partners would benefit Thai exports.",
        "Meanwhile, key negative factors underlying the revision of the baseline forecast were as follows.",
        "First, the number of foreign tourist projection was revised down following the new outbreak of COVID-19 cases as well as uncertainties pertaining to vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage which would affect the ability to re-open the country for foreign tourists and the recovery of the tourism sector.",
        "Second, the public expenditure projection was revised down driven mainly by the lower-than-expected fiscal year 2021 annual budget, the carryover budget as recently announced, as well as a reduction and postponement of state-owned enterprise investment.",
        "Looking ahead, adverse risks to the baseline projection were as follows.",
        "First, there remained uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation in the near term as well as uncertainties regarding vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage in Thailand which could be limited, consequently affecting the progress in the admission of foreign tourists in the period ahead.",
        "Second, fiscal stimulus could be lower than assumed in the baseline projection owing to a delay in the disbursement under the post-COVID economic recovery plan, the phase-out of government measures to stimulate private consumption in the first half of 2021, and the earmarking of funds available under the Emergency Decree[3/] approaching the deadline in the second half of 2021.",
        "Third, the fragile balance sheets of businesses, especially SMEs, could be at risk.",
        "If financial assistance failed to reach liquidity-constrained businesses sufficiently and timely, there could be adverse spillover effects on the labor market as well as the overall economy.",
        "containment measures implemented in Samut Sakhon province and measures that restricted some economic activities in other areas.",
        "Such measures would partially affect the services sector while the manufacturing sector would not be significantly affected.",
        "However, the released projection had yet to include the impacts of a wider spread of the new wave of infections in many other provinces as well as the announcement of more stringent measures that went effective on 4 January 2021. and fewer than 24 hours per week in non-agricultural sectors.",
        "Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic Headline inflation was projected to be negative in 2020.",
        "Headline inflation would return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period.",
        "Although the projection of crude oil prices was revised upward following the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development, the base effect of higher-thanexpected headline inflation in 2020 and lower fuel adjustment (Ft) charges in 2021 would cause the headline inflation projection to be largely unchanged from the previous forecast.",
        "Core inflation would remain at a low level close to the previous forecast.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "The Committee discussed the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain due to various factors as well as appropriate measures in the period ahead.",
        "Details of the discussions were as follows.",
        "- The situation regarding the latest wave of coronavirus infections remained highly uncertain.",
        "Thailand’s economic projection would be substantially affected in the case of a surge in new infections.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor development and assess the adequacy of government measures.",
        "The Committee viewed that proactive spending on public health including testing, monitoring, and screening, together with sufficient investment in COVID-19 vaccines, would be most worthwhile and essential to support the economic recovery.",
        "Such investment would reduce the likelihood and severity of recurring outbreaks and allow for a faster re-opening of the country.",
        "- Uneven recovery occurred across economic sectors and areas.",
        "Additional economic indicators, such as incomes of self-employed workers in non-agricultural sectors, should thus be monitored for better insights.",
        "The uneven recovery resulted in limited credit access for some businesses due to a rise in credit risks.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring for both retail borrowers and businesses to have a broader impact.",
        "Financial institutions should also accelerate credit extension under various measures such as credit guarantee schemes by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation to address liquidity constraints in a targeted and timely manner.",
        "Although such financial assistance could increase fiscal burden in the short term, they would support employment, enhance liquidity for SMEs, and reduce scarring effects which would help reduce long-term costs to the economy.",
        "- The baht would encounter some challenges going forward.",
        "The Committee assessed that in the short term global financial market sentiment would remain risk-on and the US dollar was thus expected to weaken.",
        "These would lead to rapid appreciation of the baht which could affect the fragile economic recovery.",
        "Businesses should thus hedge against currency volatilities and promptly adjust their business models to enhance value-added competitiveness and rely less on price competitiveness.",
        "The Committee viewed that the new foreign exchange ecosystem should be expedited to address structural problems in the foreign exchange market and encourage more balanced capital flows.",
        "In addition, this new ecosystem would allow Thai investors to invest abroad more easily and in a larger amount, increase flexibility in foreign exchange risk management for entrepreneurs, and promote more competitions among foreign exchange service providers.",
        "- While fiscal measures played a crucial role in supporting the economic recovery amid high uncertainties, rising public debt in the medium term would not pose a significant fiscal risk in Thailand.",
        "This was due to (1) the low level of pre-pandemic public debt, (2) the long maturity of debt as reflected in the remaining average time to maturity of approximately 10 years, (3) debt mostly denominated in local currency, and (4) nominal GDP growth expected to be higher than interest rates at which the government pays its debt.",
        "In addition, Thailand was rated BBB+ with a stable outlook.",
        "The Committee viewed that if public debt accumulation was intended to support the economic recovery and finance key infrastructure projects, this would help sustain economic growth and public debt.",
        "When the economy gets back on track, the government should strengthen fiscal capacity through revenue and expenditure reforms to promote long-term fiscal sustainability.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery while placing emphasis on the use of more targeted measures.",
        "The Committee assessed that, despite the recent better-than-expected outturns, the Thai economy would recover slowly and need support from the continued low policy rate.",
        "Nonetheless, as the policy rate was already at a historical low level and going forward the economic recovery would be fragile and highly uncertain, the Committee voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the The Committee expressed concerns over the outlook of the rapid appreciation of the baht as this affected the fragile economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows.",
        "The Committee would also consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures to ensure that the exchange rate movements would not hinder the economic recovery.",
        "By reducing pressures on the baht and addressing structural problems in the Thai foreign exchange market through expediting the new foreign exchange ecosystem, capital flows would become more balanced.",
        "The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical in supporting the economic recovery going forward.",
        "Monetary policy must remain accommodative.",
        "Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner, for example, through credit guarantee schemes to reduce credit risks.",
        "Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring to have broader impacts.",
        "Fiscal measures should continue to support the economy.",
        "The government should thus accelerate budget disbursement and target assistance to those vulnerable groups.",
        "The government should also proactively implement public health measures and procure sufficient COVID-19 vaccines to limit adverse economic impacts of the new outbreaks.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee saw the need of supply-side policies to restructure the Thai economy in the post-COVID environment that could change business structures in many industries.",
        "In particular, labor upskilling, infrastructure investment to support the digital economy, as well as regulatory reform to eliminate any obstacle to business adjustments should be promptly pursued to help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term.",
        "Under the monetary policy framework with the objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures, fragility in the labor market, and various risks, including the new wave of the domestic outbreak, the progress of protocols for admitting foreign tourists, and financial positions of businesses and households, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.",
        "Since the special meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, there were improvements in Thai financial market conditions, especially the bond markets, due to the policy rate cut and the announcement of measures to stabilize financial markets.",
        "These actions partly helped build up confidence and alleviate liquidity strain in the financial markets.",
        "Thai government bond yields declined immediately after the policy rate cut.",
        "Some investors slowed their sell-off of Thai stabilize the Thai financial markets.",
        "[2] Furthermore, Thai government bond yields fell in tandem with yields in global financial markets after the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced additional measures.",
        "The baht weakened against the US dollar due to the policy rate cut and the intensified situation of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Thailand.",
        "The Committee viewed that the economic and inflation outlook remained consistent with the assessment at the special meeting.",
        "The Thai economy would markedly contract in 2020 due mainly to the COVID-19 outbreak and would affect a large number of related businesses and employment.",
        "Tourist figures were expected to substantially decline from the previous forecast.",
        "Merchandise exports were expected to shrink in tandem with a significant slowdown in trading partner economies and the impact of supply chain disruptions.",
        "As a result, domestic demand was projected to contract in all components except for public expenditure which would grow at a lower rate than expected owing to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act.",
        "The Committee therefore projected that the Thai economy would contract by 5.3 percent in financial stability, and appropriate monetary policy formulation but did not vote.",
        "to stabilize Thai financial markets on 22 March 2020 in order to prevent a deterioration in financial market liquidity.",
        "The measures consisted of (1) providing liquidity for mutual funds affected by liquidity shortage through the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF), (2) reducing rollover risks in the corporate bond market by establishing the Corporate and consider additional measures if necessary.",
        "2020 but would recover in 2021 and expand 3.0 percent, provided that the virus spread in Thailand could be contained in accordance with the Ministry of Public Health estimate, and that the tourist figures would gradually recover.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation in 2020 would be negative at -1.0 percent.",
        "In 2021, it would be at 0.3 percent, which would remain below the inflation target.",
        "This would be owing to a rapid decline in crude oil prices, resulting in negative energy inflation.",
        "Moreover, core inflation was projected to be negative in line with a large decline in demand-pull inflationary pressures, despite a slight rise in fresh food prices due to the drought.",
        "The Committee assessed that the economic and inflation forecasts were subject to very high uncertainties, with global and domestic economic and trade structures changing after the COVID-19 spread subsided.",
        "External and domestic uncertainties were as follows.",
        "First, the COVID-19 spread could become either more severe and prolonged than expected, or otherwise if vaccines and medicines could be discovered earlier than anticipated.",
        "Second, risks pertaining to global financial stability could impact the Thai economy in the medium term.",
        "Third, geopolitical risks could intensify, while trade protectionism and the outcomes of the trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union remained unclear.",
        "Fourth, additional government stimulus measures could be forthcoming, or the measures could have lower impacts than expected.",
        "Finally, a more-severe-than-expected drought could affect agricultural output and income, with the agricultural sector unable to absorb labor from other sectors.",
        "The Committee viewed that risks in the overall financial system increased due to the severe economic downturn which affected household and business incomes, causing deterioration in debt servicing capability and credit quality.",
        "In addition, liquidity in the financial system, especially in the bond market, became tightened.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor various employed to maintain financial system stability given various situations.",
        "The Committee also agencies to stand ready to prevent systemic risks in a pre-emptive manner.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy rate cut at the previous special meeting as well as the implemented measures to promote stability in the Thai financial markets helped ease financial conditions.",
        "Commercial bank lending rates gradually declined and stability of domestic financial markets, especially the bond market, improved.",
        "Most members would wait to assess the adjustments in the financial markets as well as additional reduction in interest rates by financial institutions.",
        "Most members deemed it appropriate to preserve policy space to cushion against high uncertainties in the future.",
        "Meanwhile, all members viewed that the government’s announced relief measures and loan repayment measures to assist borrowers affected by COVID-19[3] were more targeted in addressing the problems.",
        "The Committee thus voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 0.75 percent.",
        "Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 0.75 to 0.50 percent as the extra accommodative monetary policy would, in their view, be commensurate with the significant economic contraction.",
        "The Committee viewed that the current challenges faced by the economy and financial system were different from those during the financial crisis in 1997.",
        "At present, Thailand had an ample level of international reserves.",
        "Moreover, financial institutions were sound with a high level of capital funds.",
        "Liquidity in the financial system remained adequate at the macro level.",
        "The key challenge was to urgently provide liquidity and credit supports to affected businesses and households.",
        "In particular, measures that allowed for debt moratorium, reduced interest payments, and extended debt repayment period would help alleviate the immediate impacts.",
        "For the next step, debt restructuring must be urgently and constantly implemented in parallel with distribution of liquidity, which was ample at the macro level, to businesses and households in need.",
        "Examples of such measures could include provision of soft loans for businesses and households with the potential to repay their loans as well as credit guarantees so that loans could be allocated to SMEs more efficiently.",
        "Such measures could help those affected to get through this period.",
        "The Committee viewed that targeted measures designed to address liquidity strain of those who were affected would be crucial.",
        "The Committee also viewed that, under the situation where the adverse impacts could become intensified and widespread, the Bank of Thailand had been working closely with financial institutions and other financial service providers in a timely manner to urgently determine minimum measures to reduce interest burdens and provide additional liquidity to retail and corporate borrowers with the potential to repay their loans.",
        "The Committee also viewed that loan repayment measures to assist borrowers affected by COVID-19 and the government’s relief measures were timely and more targeted than the policy rate cut in addressing the problems and effectively helped relieve the impacts of the COVID-19 spread.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee viewed that close coordination between financial and fiscal policies was needed and encouraged collaboration among related public and private organizations to speed up implementation of various financial and fiscal measures to shore up and support economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would be data-dependent by closely monitoring the economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with other associated risks, especially the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "International Banks, (3) the Government Financial Institutions Association, (4) the Thailand Leasing Association, The Committee would stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate and timely manner.",
        "Such tools included the policy rate and other monetary measures that would help enhance the policy rate transmission as well as loan extension by financial institutions to reach the target groups.",
        "After the severe contraction in the second quarter this year trading partner economies would gradually recover in line with the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures.",
        "However, economic activities in many countries remained significantly lower than the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Advanced and Asian economies (excluding China) would contract this year due to the severe situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries and the second wave of the outbreak in some countries.",
        "China would exhibit a modest growth on the back of continuous improvement in economic activities after the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "Monetary and fiscal policies in many countries continued to be accommodative to support economic recovery.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, advanced economy central banks maintained their policy rates at low levels and continued with asset purchases programs.",
        "Meanwhile, several regional central banks such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bank Negara Malaysia, and Bank Indonesia further cut their policy rates.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, governments in several countries extended the duration of some relief measures previously announced such as wage subsidy schemes for businesses in Malaysia and Singapore.",
        "Meanwhile, several governments implemented additional economic recovery measures, particularly the European Recovery Fund which was a major progress for assisting European Union member countries to cope with the economic crisis more effectively.",
        "There was a likelihood that trading partner economies would contract more than the baseline due to (1) the intensifying COVID-19 outbreak that could cause several countries to re-impose strict containment measures, (2) vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased risks with respect to corporate bond defaults or government bond downgrades, (3) re-intensifying trade tensions between the US and China which could affect global trade volume, and presidential election as seen in the revocation of Hong Kong’s privilege trade status and the sanctions against Chinese officials in retaliation for China’s imposition of the new national security law for Hong Kong.",
        "According to the Committee, the recovery outlook of trading partner economies remained highly uncertain despite some improvements in recent economic indicators.",
        "Such uncertainties included in particular the continuation of the recovery given weak economic fundamentals, the effectiveness of public measures, as well as the changing economic structures and international trade due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could hold back Thai exports from reaping the full benefits from the global economic recovery.",
        "Going forward, the Committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor such factors as they were significant to the Thai economic recovery.",
        "Global financial conditions gradually improved thanks to renewed investor confidence supported by better-than-expected recent economic indicators in several countries, together with ample liquidity in the global financial markets following continuously accommodative monetary policies of advanced economy central banks.",
        "As a result, prices of risky assets and gold continuously rose.",
        "Meanwhile, the second wave of the outbreak in some countries temporarily amplified volatilities in the global financial markets.",
        "However, investors remained cautious in selecting asset classes and destinations to re-invest, as reflected in the differences in debt and equity inflows to emerging markets.",
        "Regarding financial market conditions in Thailand, commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields remained low, whereas corporate bond spreads were still high.",
        "With regard to liquidity, commercial bank loans expanded on the back of large corporates’ borrowing to substitute bond financing.",
        "Meanwhile, SME and consumer loans decelerated due to tightened credit standards despite some reliefs from the loan repayment holiday measure.",
        "With the level of overall liquidity in the financial system remaining ample, the Committee deemed it important that liquidity be better distributed to affected On exchange rates, volatilities of the baht increased due to both domestic and global factors.",
        "Shortly after the previous meeting, the baht depreciated due to domestic factors such as concerns over the likelihood of the second wave of the outbreak and domestic political uncertainties.",
        "Later, the baht appreciated due to the weakening of the US dollar pressured by several factors such as the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the unprecedented economic contraction in the second quarter.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) overall depreciated from the previous meeting despite having strengthened somewhat recently.",
        "The Committee viewed that if the baht were to appreciate rapidly, the economic recovery could be affected.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in the financial markets and foreign exchange markets, together with assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures such as measures to encourage balanced capital flows by increasing flexibility and convenience in foreign currency transactions and by promoting further liberalization of outward portfolio investments.",
        "The Thai economy would gradually recover in line with the relaxation of the COVID-19 containment measures in Thailand and the gradual improvement in global economic activities.",
        "Nevertheless, the overall economic activities remained at a significantly lower level than the pre-pandemic period.",
        "Regarding exports of services, the public concerns over the course of Thailand’s reopening would result in a slower-than-expected progress in admitting foreign tourists.",
        "However, the number of domestic tourists picked up owing partly to domestic tourism stimulus measures.",
        "Merchandise exports contracted markedly in the second quarter this year, although the June exports data indicated improvements in some categories.",
        "Nonetheless, exports of goods remained modest and would take time before returning to the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Although private consumption started to recover following the relaxation of containment measures, it would remain in contraction throughout the year due to deteriorated household incomes, rising unemployment, and low consumer confidence.",
        "Uncertainties in the period ahead and elevated household debt would lead to more cautious spending and increased savings by households.",
        "Private investment would contract significantly in line with weak investor confidence.",
        "However, private investment going forward would be supported by planned relocation of production base to Thailand under the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and investment in both large-scale infrastructure and infrastructure to support the digital economy that were likely to proceed continuously.",
        "Public expenditure would be a major economic driver on the back of disbursements under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic.",
        "Nevertheless, part of transfer payments under remedy and restoration plans would be delayed as some were pending approval.",
        "Meanwhile, the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Bill for fiscal year 2021 was expected to proceed as scheduled.",
        "The Committee extensively discussed the challenges for the Thai economy in the period ahead, especially the economic recovery in the latter half of this year that could be restrained by several factors.",
        "These included (1) the number of foreign tourists that could increase less than previously assessed due to risks that the second wave of the outbreak in many countries could result in changes in attitude and behavior regarding international travel, and (2) private consumption that could be dampened by deteriorated household incomes, elevated household debt, and low agencies to explore additional measures to restore the economy, particularly the appropriate travel protocols for foreign tourists.",
        "Such protocols would need thorough assessment of the trade-off between economic and public health considerations, and should be implemented with the public’s confidence in the safety of such procedures.",
        "Other measures included those targeting at households, especially measures to create new jobs and support affected workforce as well as measures to reduce debt burden and increase liquidity for households in order to support private consumption.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee discussed policies to support important economic sectors affected by the COVID-19 outbreak such as the hotel industry as well as the automotive and auto parts industry.",
        "The Committee noted that recovery would vary among industries and policy implications would be different.",
        "Sectors with a slow recovery outlook would entail significant excess capacity and affect employment.",
        "Meanwhile, sectors with high recovery potential would need to adjust their business models in preparation for the post-COVID environment.",
        "The government would thus need to accelerate the implementation of supply-side policies to support economic restructuring.",
        "Headline inflation slightly edged up in line with crude oil prices but would remain negative in 2020.",
        "Core inflation would remain at a low level.",
        "Headline inflation would rise toward target in inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities given the economic conditions affected by the COVID-19 situation.",
        "Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels capable of absorbing the impacts of the pandemic.",
        "However, looking ahead, commercial banks needed to prepare for the uncertain COVID-19 situation and a deteriorated debt servicing capability of businesses and households.",
        "Financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring for retail borrowers and businesses to be in line with the income stream and debt servicing capability in the post-COVID environment.",
        "Furthermore, financial institutions should accelerate and broadly extend credits to the affected businesses and households under various measures such as soft loans, credit guarantees by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation, and loans provided by specialized financial institutions.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would gradually recover in line with the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures in Thailand and the gradual improvement in global economic activities.",
        "However, overall economic activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level and the Committee would remain cautious about risks of the second wave of the outbreak.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee viewed that the low level fiscal measures, helped alleviate adverse impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks.",
        "The Committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.",
        "The Committee viewed that the record-low policy rate would support the economic recovery.",
        "Moreover, a further decrease in the policy rate would be less effective in the current context, where it could affect financial intermediation, increase vulnerabilities in the financial system through underpricing of risks, as well as affect savings.",
        "The Committee thus deemed it necessary to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the appropriate and most effective timing.",
        "The Committee viewed that accelerating credit extension and debt restructuring would be necessary to support the economic recovery.",
        "Financial and credit measures going forward needed to emphasize on (1) ensuring that liquidity be distributed to have broader impacts on affected business and households through the acceleration of credit extension under various measures, (2) helping financial institutions to significantly accelerate debt restructuring for borrowers especially households and businesses, and (3) preparing additional measures to reduce solvency risks for businesses and establishing mechanisms to standardize and expedite debt restructuring.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that fiscal policy needed to play a greater role going forward to support economic recovery and economic restructuring, as the recovery would take time and vary among sectors.",
        "As a result, government measures going forward needed to be continuously implemented in a targeted and timely manner.",
        "In addition, supply-side policies should be given a greater role in supporting economic restructuring, facilitating changes in business models, as well as reskilling and upskilling the workforce to be ready for the post-pandemic environment.",
        "The government should establish platforms to facilitate access to labor market data in local areas as well as establish mechanisms in place for labor skill development especially for those who did not possess the skills required for a job.",
        "The Committee additionally discussed the role of monetary policy to help support fiscal policy going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that as fiscal policy would play a greater role in the period ahead, public debt would increase.",
        "However, the significant decrease in financing costs, ample liquidity in the financial system, and the currently low public debt level would allow for the fiscal policy space to restore and restructure the economy in the post-COVID environment.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit measures in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate policy tools if necessary.",
        "Trading partner economies were expected to gradually recover.",
        "Despite continuous improvement in recent economic indicators in several countries, overall economic activities remained significantly lower than the pre- pandemic level.",
        "Advanced and Asian economies (excluding China) were projected to contract this year, especially Asian economies which would contract more than previously assessed, due to the ongoing severe situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries and new waves of outbreak in some countries that led governments to re-impose containment measures.",
        "However, governments would likely avoid strict containment measures to limit economic impacts.",
        "China would exhibit a modest growth on the back of continuous improvement in economic activities after the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "Monetary policy in many countries continued to be accommodative to support economic recovery.",
        "The Federal Reserve would maintain the policy rate at a low level for a longer period following the adoption of flexible average inflation targeting policy framework.",
        "Advanced economy central banks maintained policy rates at low levels and continued with asset purchase programs.",
        "Meanwhile, several regional central banks maintained policy rates at low levels.",
        "There was a likelihood that trading partner economies would contract more than the baseline projection due to ( 1) an intensification of the COVID- 19 outbreak that could cause several countries to re-impose strict containment measures, (2) vulnerabilities in the global financial system owing to increased risks with respect to corporate bond defaults or downgrades, According to the Committee’s assessment the continuation of the recovery of trading partner economies would remain highly uncertain.",
        "Following severe economic contraction in the second quarter, recent economic activities increased somewhat thanks mainly to government measures to stimulate private consumption, pent- up demand, and expenses occurred in adapting to the pandemic environment such as working from home.",
        "Meanwhile, economic fundamentals that would sustain expansion of private consumption remained noticeably weak.",
        "In particular, trading partner economic recoveries could be hampered by unemployment in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee thus deemed it necessary to closely monitor such factors as they would have important implications for the Thai economic recovery.",
        "Volatilities in the global financial markets remained mostly unchanged since the previous meeting as investors awaited developments of key events including the Brexit deal and the US presidential election.",
        "Furthermore, investors remained cautious in selecting asset classes and destinations to re-invest, as reflected in the differences in debt and equity inflows to emerging markets.",
        "Prices of most assets stabilized since the previous meeting except for equities in the technology sector which experienced downward price corrections following sharp increases in the previous period and investors’ concerns over the technology conflict between the US and China.",
        "Regarding financial market conditions in Thailand, commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields remained low, whereas corporate bond spreads started to decrease for bonds with high credit ratings.",
        "Commercial bank loans expanded on the back of large corporate and retail loans.",
        "Meanwhile, SME loans contracted, albeit at a lower rate thanks in part to government credit measures and loan repayment holiday measures.",
        "The Committee viewed that the overall level of liquidity in the financial system remained ample and should be better On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar and regional currencies since the previous meeting partly owing to domestic factors such as new COVID-19 cases in Thailand and political uncertainties especially the resignation of the finance minister and the political protests.",
        "Furthermore, global factors such as ongoing Brexit negotiations and re-intensifying tensions between the US and China also affected investor confidence.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) overall depreciated from the previous meeting.",
        "The Committee viewed that if the baht were to appreciate rapidly the economic recovery could be affected.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in the financial markets and foreign exchange markets, together with assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures such as measures to encourage balanced capital flows by increasing flexibility and convenience in foreign currency transactions and by promoting further liberalization of outward portfolio investments.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to gradually recover in line with the relaxation of the domestic COVID-19 containment measures and the gradual improvement in global economic activities.",
        "Nevertheless, overall economic activities remained at a significantly lower level than the pre-pandemic period.",
        "Merchandise exports would gradually improve in several categories.",
        "The recovery so far remained modest and slower than those of the regional economies, as Thai exports consisted of a relatively larger share of slow recovery products such as automotive and auto parts.",
        "Regarding exports of services, the number of foreign tourists would recover at a slower rate than the previous assessment due to new waves of outbreak in some countries and the highly uncertain protocols in admitting foreign tourists to Thailand.",
        "Private consumption started to recover following the relaxation of containment measures.",
        "Nonetheless, it would remain vulnerable given a slow recovery of household income due to the weak labor market, low consumer confidence, and increased household debt.",
        "Private investment would contract significantly in line with considerable excess capacity and weak investor confidence.",
        "However, private investment going forward would be supported by planned relocation of production base to Thailand under the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and investment in both large-scale infrastructure and infrastructure to support the digital economy that were likely to proceed continuously.",
        "Public expenditure would be a major economic driver on the back of disbursements under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic.",
        "Nevertheless, government stimulus in 2020 would be lower than the previous assessment, as part of transfer payments under the remedy and restoration plans would be delayed to 2021.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to contract this year by 7.8 percent, slightly better than previously forecasted, and would expand next year at 3.6 percent, lower than the previous forecast, mainly due to the slow recovery of foreign tourist figures.",
        "Nevertheless, the Thai economic recovery would still be subject to various risks, including the global economic recovery that could be slower than expected, the deteriorating debt servicing capability of businesses and households, and the recovery of foreign tourist figures that could be more modest than previously assessed if the government protocols for admitting foreign tourists could not be implemented.",
        "The Committee extensively discussed the challenges for the Thai economy in the period ahead, especially the recovery that would greatly vary among economic sectors, regions, and firms in different segments.",
        "The Committee assessed that such differentiation would have implications for more targeted and timely government policies.",
        "Examples included (1) promotion of employment and labor skill development to accommodate those that could be affected in sectors with a slow recovery outlook and considerable excess capacity, (2) job creation in provincial areas to absorb return migration, and (3) supply-side policies, particularly economic restructuring, to support sectors with high recovery potential in adjusting their business models to the post-COVID environment.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to be less negative this year than the previous assessment on the back of increasing energy prices as demand rose after the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures.",
        "Core inflation would remain at a low level.",
        "However, given the economic recovery, headline inflation would gradually rise next year and stay close to the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",
        "The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities given the economic conditions affected by the COVID-19 situation.",
        "Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels capable of absorbing the impacts of the pandemic.",
        "However, looking ahead, commercial banks needed to prepare for the uncertain COVID-19 situation and the deteriorating debt servicing capability of businesses and households.",
        "The Committee viewed that financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring for retail borrowers and businesses to a wide extent and accelerate lending under various measures to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner consistent with business restructuring.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would gradually recover in line with the relaxation of domestic COVID-19 containment measures and the gradual improvement in global economic activities.",
        "The Thai economy would contract in 2020 slightly less than the previous forecast but would expand in 2021 at a lower rate than previously forecasted mainly due to the slow recovery of foreign tourist figures.",
        "The Committee assessed that overall economic activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level.",
        "The Committee would continue to monitor risks of a second wave of the outbreak.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee viewed that the low level of the policy rate, along with financial and credit would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks.",
        "The Committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.",
        "The Committee viewed that the record-low policy rate would facilitate the economic recovery.",
        "Moreover, a further decrease in the policy rate would be less effective in the current context and could affect financial intermediation, increase vulnerabilities in the financial system through underpricing of risks, as well as affect savings.",
        "The Committee thus deemed it necessary to preserve the limited policy space for the appropriate and most effective timing.",
        "The Committee noted that policy coordination among government agencies would be crucial to ensure coherent and consistent measures, namely, fiscal measures as the main driving force of the economy, together with continued accommodative monetary policy, as well as financial and credit measures to support liquidity.",
        "Financial and credit measures going forward needed to emphasize on (1) ensuring that liquidity be distributed to have broader impacts on affected business and households through acceleration of credit extension under various measures and standardization of credit terms to help provide liquidity for SMEs, (2) helping financial institutions to significantly accelerate debt restructuring for borrowers especially households and businesses, and (3) preparing additional measures to reduce solvency risks for businesses and establishing mechanisms to standardize and expedite debt restructuring.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee viewed that fiscal policy needed to play a greater role going forward to support economic recovery and economic restructuring, as the recovery would take time and would vary among economic sectors, regions, and firms in different segments.",
        "As a result, government measures going forward needed to be continuously implemented in a targeted and timely manner.",
        "In addition, supplyside policies should be given a greater role in supporting economic restructuring, adjustments of business models by entrepreneurs, and labor skill development consistent with the post-COVID environment in order to ensure a sustained economic recovery.",
        "The Committee expressed concerns about and extensively discussed labor market conditions, as both employment and income remained weak, which could affect the economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Although some businesses could resume their operations after the relaxation of the COVID-19 containment measures, employment and income remained significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Additionally, a portion of labor switched to agricultural and freelance work which resulted in lower incomes.",
        "The recovery of the labor market going forward would be vulnerable to (1) a potentially prolonged COVID-19 pandemic which could further reduce labor incomes or create more layoffs, (2) the phase-out of the government measures to remedy and restore the economy, (3) the ending of the agricultural season in the first half of next year which would impair the agricultural sector’s ability to absorb labor from other sectors, and especially aging workers, new graduates, and workers whose skills would be mismatched with the post-COVID environment, which could affect the long-term potential growth of the economy.",
        "Therefore, labor policies going forward would be indispensable and would need to be more targeted and take into account differences within each economic sector, variations in recovery as well as obstacles to adjustments in each area.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit measures in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate policy tools if necessary.",
        "Trading partner economies would contract more than previously assessed due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the containment measures worldwide, affecting economic activities and employment.",
        "Advanced and Asian economies (excluding China) would enter recession, with manufacturing and exports contracting due to global demand.",
        "China would exhibit slower growth.",
        "Although some containment measures had been relaxed, social distancing measures remained in place.",
        "Economic activities in both manufacturing and services sectors exhibited some improvements, but were still below normal levels.",
        "Countries worldwide continued to announce financial and fiscal measures to alleviate impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "Nevertheless, fiscal policy implementation in several advanced economies would be more constrained given the rising public debt-to-GDP ratios.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, advanced economy central banks maintained their policy rates at ultra-low levels, as well as expanded asset purchases programs and lending facilities.",
        "Meanwhile, several regional central banks further eased their monetary policy.",
        "For example, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered the policy rate and the Monetary Authority of Singapore relaxed its exchange rate policy band.",
        "Most central banks would likely implement further accommodative monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a likelihood of trading partner economies contracting more than the baseline assessment and recovering only slowly due to the intensifying COVID-19 outbreak in some countries or the second wave of the outbreak in countries that started to relax the containment measures.",
        "Moreover, there were other risks, including in the financial and other sectors, e.g., solvency risks in the household and corporate sectors or potential multiple sell-offs resulting in sharp declines in asset prices and distressed assets that could in turn affect the economy, (3) volatilities in oil and commodity prices, and (4) geopolitical risks.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and the above-mentioned risks as they could weigh on the recovery of trading partner economies and cause volatile movements in global financial markets, which would have spillovers on the Thai economy.",
        "Stability in the financial markets increased after the Bank of Thailand implemented stabilization measures.",
        "The Bank of Thailand provided liquidity through government bond purchases as well as the establishment of the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF) and the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF).",
        "These measures resulted in a decline of government bond yields after prior spikes due to tightened global financial conditions.",
        "Corporate bond yields in the secondary markets showed lower volatility.",
        "Bond market functioning increasingly returned to normal.",
        "Commercial bank loans expanded, especially large corporate loans which became an alternative to bond issuances.",
        "Demand for working capital also rose during the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "The Committee viewed that the level of overall liquidity in the financial system remained ample.",
        "However, it was deemed important that liquidity be substantially distributed to businesses and households affected by COVID-19.",
        "Commercial bank lending rates declined following the previous policy rate cut and the reduction in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution from 0.46 percent of the deposit base to 0.23 percent for two years.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht appreciated against the US dollar and regional currencies, as reflected by a rise in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER).",
        "Risk-on sentiment among investors returned after the COVID-19 outbreak improved and many countries, including Thailand, started to relax the containment measures.",
        "Moreover, monetary policy stances of advanced economy central banks over the recent periods were more accommodative.",
        "Foreign investors thus returned to invest in long-term Thai government bonds.",
        "However, there were net foreign selling in the Thai stock markets.",
        "In addition, the baht experienced some pressures from a rise in gold exports following increases in gold prices.",
        "Looking ahead, global financial markets would remain volatile due to risks and uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak and the global economic outlook.",
        "The Committee expressed concerns over the baht that could strengthen and affect the economic recovery.",
        "Therefore, the Committee would closely monitor developments in the financial markets and the foreign exchange markets, as well as the results of the implemented measures to relax regulations on capital outflows.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee would examine measures to lessen pressures from gold exports on the baht.",
        "The Thai economy would contract more than the previous assessment.",
        "Export of services would contract more than expected due to a sharp decline in tourist figures caused by potentially extended travel restrictions.",
        "Merchandise exports would contract more than assessed in line with the trading partners’ economic outlook.",
        "The contraction in oil prices would also affect the export prices of petroleum-related products.",
        "The fall in external and domestic demand resulted in widespread declines in business and household incomes.",
        "Private consumption would contract from higher unemployment and the containment measures.",
        "Nevertheless, relief measures from the government and related agencies would partially shore up household purchasing power.",
        "Furthermore, the drought impact on agricultural households became more pronounced, while non-agricultural households were affected by reduced working hours and wages as well as layoffs.",
        "Private investment would contract due to shrinking demand and lower confidence.",
        "Moreover, businesses scaled down investment to preserve liquidity.",
        "However, there were still investment prospects in telecommunications and healthcare to cope with COVID-19, while some electronics manufacturers would relocate the production bases to Thailand.",
        "Public expenditure would expand more than assessed.",
        "The government increased the budget for Phases I and II of relief measures to alleviate the impacts of COVID-19.",
        "The government also announced Phase III measures and additional measures.",
        "Some of these would be financed by (1) the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society, with the budget limit of 1 trillion baht, and (2) the revision of the 2020 budget according to the Budget Expenditure Transfer Bill.",
        "The government and related agencies would focus on providing relief to the affected groups and supporting public health expenditure, as well as restoring the economy and society after the containment of COVID-19.",
        "The Committee discussed extensively about economic recovery in the period ahead amid high uncertainties and examined different scenarios arising from key factors including (1) trading partners’ economic outlook, the pandemic, and successful developments of vaccines or medicines, (2) the relaxation of containment measures and the likelihood of the second wave of outbreak in Thailand, and (3) the effectiveness of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, which needed to be implemented in a targeted and timely manner to support employment and SMEs.",
        "The Committee expressed concerns regarding the job outlook, which would deteriorate sharply and could take a long time to return to normal, for employees and the self-employed.",
        "Some workers may be temporarily unemployed during the containment period.",
        "Others, however, could be permanently unemployed due to business insolvencies resulting in shutdowns, layoffs from weak demand, or greater use of automation.",
        "Therefore, it would be more difficult for new graduates to find jobs.",
        "These would delay the economic recovery and reduce the long-term potential growth, causing lasting economic scars after the crisis.",
        "The Committee would therefore closely monitor developments in the labor market.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that there was a risk of private investment remaining subdued due to balance sheet vulnerabilities in the private sector, rising unemployment, and the weak economic outlook.",
        "Therefore, fiscal measures and public investment must be key drivers to support the economy and reduce the risks that the economy would aggravate to the level detrimental to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "Headline inflation would be below target.",
        "It would be more negative than previously assessed mainly due to energy prices in line with a sharp fall in oil prices and government measures to lower electricity bills, as well as due to lower fresh food prices in line with demand during the outbreak containment.",
        "Nonetheless, prices of goods in the other categories still expanded.",
        "Core inflation would remain subdued at low levels because of weakened domestic demand as well as government measures to reduce costs of living.",
        "Headline and core inflation would remain subject to downside risks in line with risks to the economic outlook and crude oil prices.",
        "According to the Committee’s assessment, headline inflation would only temporarily fall into the negative territory due mainly to energy prices, while medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target, suggesting the absence of deflation risks.",
        "The prospects of an economic downturn this year led to increased financial system vulnerabilities.",
        "The number of households and businesses facing debt servicing capability risks was expected to rise, especially after the phase-outs of liquidity support measures.",
        "Furthermore, hotels, restaurants, and airlines would be impinged significantly by COVID-19.",
        "The petroleum industry would be affected by lower oil prices.",
        "The real estate sector would experience a decline in both domestic and external demand.",
        "The condominium price index started to stabilize after its prior increase.",
        "Developers postponed new project launches and introduced greater promotions to reduce excess supply.",
        "The Committee saw that most developers raised funds through both commercial bank loans and corporate bonds.",
        "In addition, the real estate sector was highly interconnected with other economic sectors such as construction.",
        "Therefore, real estate conditions warranted continued monitoring.",
        "In addition, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor liquidity and solvency risks of households and businesses.",
        "In case of widespread defaults, there would be material impacts on lenders, including commercial banks, non-banks, mutual funds, and saving cooperatives, which could in turn deteriorate economic activities.",
        "Nevertheless, the overall financial institution system remained sound.",
        "Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels, capable of withstanding economic volatilities encourage debt restructuring and relaxed liquid asset criteria, including the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), to be temporarily below 100 percent.",
        "In the period ahead, there remained a need to monitor the risks that may pose vulnerabilities to the stability of the commercial banking system, particularly defaults by households and businesses.",
        "The Committee assessed that financial institutions needed to accelerate debt restructuring for borrowers proactively and expedite credit extension under various measures previously announced.",
        "The Committee also deemed it necessary for the Bank of Thailand and other related regulatory agencies to prepare measures for coping with the increasing risks if debt servicing capability of borrowers were to deteriorate more than expected.",
        "Some examples included the establishment of mechanisms to standardize and expedite multi-creditor debt restructuring, as well as the expanded roles of asset management companies (AMCs) in absorbing non-performing loans.",
        "The Committee saw the need to monitor saving cooperatives which could be affected by their corporate bond investment.",
        "In addition, the Committee deemed it important to ensure the liquidity and stability of the financial institution system, with liquidity being distributed to affected businesses and households.",
        "The Committee voted 4 to 3 to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 0.75 to 0.50 percent.",
        "Three members voted to maintain the policy rate at 0.75 percent.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract this year more than the previous assessment due to the global economic outlook and impacts of the containment measures worldwide.",
        "The economic downturn would further deteriorate employment and pose vulnerabilities to financial stability, with adverse impacts more widespread than expected.",
        "Several entrepreneurs would neither be able to adjust their businesses to survive nor adapt to future changes in business models.",
        "These would delay the economic recovery and lower long-term potential growth.",
        "Meanwhile, headline inflation would be more negative than previously assessed.",
        "Most members thus viewed that more accommodative monetary policy would help alleviate the negative impacts.",
        "Given that the economic recovery would be restrained in the period ahead, monetary policy should be further eased at this meeting to benefit the economy in a timely manner as well as to reinforce the previously announced fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",
        "Nevertheless, three members voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting, focusing on expediting the effectiveness of the announced financial and credit measures.",
        "Some members would wait to assess the effectiveness of the previously implemented policies, along with economic activities and the outbreak development after the relaxation of the containment measures, before deciding on additional monetary policy action in the period ahead.",
        "The Committee as a whole agreed that financial institutions should work to ensure that debt restructuring, particularly for household and SME borrowers, be carried out on a wider scale while debt moratoriums were still effective.",
        "Furthermore, lending under the previously announced measures should also be accelerated to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner.",
        "These credit measures included provision of soft loans by the Bank of Thailand and the Government Savings Bank, credit guarantee facilities by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation (TCG), and lending facilities to retail borrowers by specialized financial institutions.",
        "These measures would help alleviate liquidity problems of households and businesses as well as support the economic recovery.",
        "The Committee viewed that targeted and timely fiscal measures would be vital to support employment and SMEs and facilitate the economic recovery and preserve potential growth going forward.",
        "Regarding public debt in Thailand, with the pre-COVID debt-to-GDP at a low level, the average time to maturity at approximately 10 years, and debt mostly denominated in baht, fiscal policy would thus still have some room to restore and restructure the economy in the medium term.",
        "While this would result in a rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio in the period ahead, the increase in public debt would be manageable, provided that investment outlays were made in economic restructuring and future productivity enhancement.",
        "Moreover, financing costs of public debt were low in line with the government bond yields.",
        "The Committee viewed that fiscal, financial, and credit measures needed to be closely coordinated for timely and continuous implementation.",
        "During the economic recovery phase, the measures should be focused on promoting employment and income.",
        "Furthermore, the measures should support financial institutions in expediting debt restructuring and accelerating credit extension under various schemes, prior to the phase-outs of financial and fiscal relief measures.",
        "This could prevent widespread defaults that could affect financial stability and long-term potential growth.",
        "In addition, government measures would also need to support economic restructuring and entrepreneurial adjustments with new business models after the outbreak subsided.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate policy tools if necessary.",
        "Since the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in February 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak continued to worsen and deteriorated rapidly.",
        "The outbreak raised concerns in global financial markets and affected liquidity in Thai financial markets during the week prior to the scheduled meeting around the end of March.",
        "The Committee thus held a special meeting on 20 March 2020 to assess the rapidly changing outbreak situation and its impacts on the economic outlook and the functioning of financial markets, particularly during the week prior to the special meeting, to consider necessary measures in a timely manner.",
        "Trading partner economies would experience a significant slowdown due mainly to the prolonged and intensified COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "Advanced economies, especially the euro area, Japan, and the US, would likely enter recession.",
        "Manufacturing production and exports were affected by supply chain disruptions.",
        "Consumption and tourism significantly weakened, leading to substantial declines in employment and consumer confidence.",
        "China and Asian economies would exhibit much slower growth despite some improvements in China’s economic activities after the COVID-19 outbreak started to abate.",
        "However, the spread of COVID-19 to various countries in Asia caused significant slowdown in Asian economic activities.",
        "Nevertheless, public sectors in various countries worldwide announced financial and fiscal measures to alleviate the impacts.",
        "In particular, central banks stepped up efforts to increase monetary policy accommodation.",
        "For example, the Federal Reserve Malaysia (BNM) reduced their policy rates to support the economies.",
        "The People’s Bank of China additional measures concurrently such as financial assistance for households or SMEs and wage subsidy schemes.",
        "The Committee assessed that there was a likelihood of trading partners’ economic growth being lower than the baseline assessment due to the COVID-19 situation that could become more severe and widespread to other countries, together with other risks including financial system vulnerabilities in many countries, geopolitical risks, risks pertaining to trade protectionism that remained highly uncertain, as well as uncertainties regarding trade deal after Brexit.",
        "The Committee thus saw a need to closely monitor those risks, especially the COVID-19 as it could significantly impact the Thai economy through various channels including tourism, manufacturing, and merchandise exports.",
        "In addition, capital flows and financial markets volatilities also warranted close monitoring.",
        "Concerns in global financial markets heightened from the COVID-19 spread outside China, which became more severe and affected the functioning of global and Thai financial markets.",
        "This was reflected in the sharp rise in the VIX index since late February.",
        "Risk-off sentiments among investors led to a steady decline in the holding of risky assets, both equities and bonds.",
        "Investors accelerated selling of equities in the middle of March, resulting in sharp plummets of stock market indices in advanced economies which frequently triggered circuit breakers.",
        "Meanwhile, investors sold off US government bonds in exchange for cash that was perceived as less risky.",
        "Prices on US government bonds fell while yields rose quickly.",
        "The sharp surge in demand for US dollars in global financial markets resulted in a dollar liquidity squeeze, reflected in a more negative cross currency basis.",
        "Moreover, foreign investors also reduced holdings of emerging market assets, affecting Thai equity and bond markets.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht weakened against trading partner currencies, especially major currencies, and exhibited volatile movements.",
        "The baht depreciated against the US dollar since the February meeting and also depreciated against regional currencies as reflected in the continuous decline in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) since the beginning of this year.",
        "This was due to investor concerns about the outlook of Thai economy caused by both external and domestic factors, especially the COVID-19 outbreak which became more severe and widespread.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht moved in line with other currencies affected by the outbreak.",
        "In the bond market, the Thai government bond yields were volatile.",
        "Short-term Thai government bond yields declined in line with the policy rate cut at the February meeting.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields fell in line with the US counterpart.",
        "Nevertheless, after the COVID-19 spread triggered risk-off sentiments in global financial markets, foreign investors continually reduced their investments in both short- and long-term Thai government bonds.",
        "Moreover, some Thai investors rushed to redeem their investment units in daily fixed income funds, which allowed for daily redemption, especially the funds investing in foreign assets.",
        "Some mutual funds therefore sold off government bonds in order to have enough cash to return to unitholders.",
        "Consequently, Thai government bond yields in some tenors rose rapidly and affected the liquidity and functioning of financial markets.",
        "This was reflected in the abnormally high provided liquidity through a large amount of government bond purchases to alleviate the impacts.",
        "The Committee viewed that the financial markets would remain highly uncertain in the period ahead, primarily depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 situation.",
        "The Committee would therefore closely monitor the situation and its implications on capital flows and financial markets.",
        "The Committee also asked the Bank of Thailand to ensure sufficient liquidity as well as the well-functioning and stability of the financial markets.",
        "The Committee viewed that recent liquidity strains in the Thai financial markets, especially the bond markets, were partly due to tighter liquidity in global financial markets, despite overall stability of the Thai financial system.",
        "If the liquidity tightening extended to corporate bond markets, the real sector could be affected.",
        "The Committee therefore deemed it necessary for related organizations to prepare preventive measures to address liquidity strains in financial markets from further intensifying and affecting overall financial system stability.",
        "The Thai economy would likely contract significantly in 2020 due mainly to the COVID-19 outbreak which affected external demand and domestic economic activities.",
        "Exports of services would severely contract because of the deterioration in both tourist figures and tourism receipts after the outbreak became more severe and travel bans were announced.",
        "Merchandise exports would markedly decline in line with the significant slowdown of trading partners’ economies, where some countries would enter recession.",
        "Merchandise exports would also be affected by supply chain disruptions.",
        "Benefits arising from increased demand in some product categories could not be offset by these headwinds.",
        "The significant slowdown in external demand and supply chain disruptions in many countries would lead to reduction in domestic economic activities.",
        "These would widely affect business and household incomes and consequently result in shrinking domestic demand.",
        "Private consumption would fall, as already seen in the decline in away-from-home expenditure, in line with both farm and non-farm incomes and the limited financial cushion for necessary expenses.",
        "Agricultural households would be affected by the drought whose impact turned out more severe than expected.",
        "Furthermore, elevated household debt would still weigh on private consumption in the period ahead.",
        "Private investment would experience a downturn owing to domestic and external demand.",
        "Some businesses expressed weakened confidence, leading to slowing down or postponing investment.",
        "Nevertheless, infrastructure investment, including public-private partnership projects, would support private investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure would expand, albeit at a slower pace than the previous assessment from the impacts of the delayed Annual Budget Expenditure Act.",
        "For 2021, the Thai economy was expected to recover if (1) the virus spread abated, (2) fiscal measures could sustain economic activities, alleviate the adverse impacts, and assist various groups affected by the outbreak, and (3) financial institutions’ assistance measures to borrowers could help relieve the impacts of the outbreak.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussions regarding factors contributing to the Thai economic recovery in the period ahead amid heightening risks and assessed the impacts of risks under each scenario.",
        "The key risks were as follows.",
        "First, the current COVID-19 outbreak could become more severe and widespread.",
        "The Committee saw that the outbreak in the period ahead would be difficult to forecast accurately under potentially different outcomes.",
        "For example, despite some countries having successfully contained the outbreak, the outbreak could spread to other countries or re-emerge in the previously contained countries.",
        "Under each scenario, the impacts on tourism and economic activities would be different.",
        "For Thailand, if the outbreak could be contained within the second quarter of 2020 according to the Ministry of Public Health estimates, tourist figures might recover somewhat during the second half of this year.",
        "Second, regarding shock absorption capacity and the global recovery outlook, the global economy would likely enter into a recession given that the COVID-19 outbreak affected behavior and lifestyle of the population.",
        "Meanwhile, the speed of the global economic recovery in the period ahead depended on many factors, including the intensity and duration of the outbreak at home and abroad, vaccine development, along with the capacity of the economy to adapt and to absorb shocks.",
        "Under each scenario, the exports of goods and services would be affected through lower trading partners’ incomes and supply chain disruptions in many countries.",
        "Third, domestic financial and fiscal measures would be key mechanisms to alleviate the impacts on the economy and assist various groups affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "After the number of related agencies, and financial institutions announced some relief measures such as measures to boost liquidity and reduce debt burden.",
        "The Committee viewed that such measures were appropriate.",
        "However, since the outbreak would remain highly uncertain in the period ahead, financial and fiscal measures needed to be coordinated proactively as well as expanded to assist the affected groups in an adequate, comprehensive, and timely manner to sustain the economy.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would face elevated risks going forward.",
        "Significant external risks therefore warranted close monitoring.",
        "These included the COVID-19 spread and containment, the impacts on the global economic outlook which may result in severe recessions, and relief and stimulus measures of each country.",
        "Further risks that warranted close monitoring included the spread of the virus in Thailand, the policies and measures to assist affected groups, financial institution assistance to borrowers, together with the impact of drought on the economy that could be more severe than expected.",
        "These factors would have implications on the economic recovery and the long-term potential of the Thai economy.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation would be below the target throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "Headline inflation would be negative in 2020 owing to falling energy prices in line with subdued energy demand mainly because of the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "Core inflation would decrease on the back of falling demand-pull inflationary pressures, while the increase in fresh food prices would have limited impacts.",
        "For 2021, headline inflation would increase somewhat given the low-base effect of energy prices in 2020.",
        "However, this could not offset the continuous decline in core inflation.",
        "Headline and core inflation would be subject to downside risks in line with risks to the economy and crude oil prices.",
        "The financial system remained sound overall, but vulnerabilities increased in some pockets given the sharp economic contraction that potentially led to income shocks, falling asset prices and tighter financial conditions.",
        "This could lead to worsening debt servicing capability and higher corporate bond rollover risks.",
        "Nonetheless, the Thai banking system remained healthy with high levels of capital fund and loan loss provision to withstand deteriorating loan quality.",
        "In addition, external stability remained robust, indicated by ample international reserves.",
        "The Committee discussed the increased complexity of the interconnectedness within the financial system, together with efforts to ring-fence risks seen in some areas to prevent negative spillovers.",
        "The Committee saw that risks in the corporate bond markets might be transmitted to corporate bond holders and to some saving cooperatives that had high proportion of vulnerable corporate bonds in their portfolios.",
        "The Committee thus supported the establishment of the Corporate Bond Liquidity Stabilization Fund (BSF) and deemed it necessary for related organizations to prepare readily available measures to prevent the liquidity strain in financial markets from spreading further and affecting overall financial system stability.",
        "The Committee viewed that the COVID-19 spread in the period ahead would be more severe than expected and the situation would take some time before returning to normal.",
        "As a result, the Thai economy would markedly contract in 2020.",
        "The headline inflation was projected to be negative this year and below the lower bound of the target throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "Financial stability became more vulnerable due to the weakened growth outlook in the near term.",
        "Moreover, the outbreak caused concerns among global financial markets and affected liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite overall stability of the financial system.",
        "The Committee viewed that prompt policy action prior to the scheduled meeting would help alleviate the impacts on the Thai economy and financial markets in a timely manner amid the rapid changes in the outbreak situation.",
        "The Committee thus voted unanimously to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.00 to 0.75 percent effective on 23 March 2020.",
        "The policy rate cut would reduce interest burdens of affected borrowers, alleviate liquidity strain in the financial markets, mitigate the impacts on the economy, and would also reinforce fiscal measures already implemented and forthcoming.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy rate cut in the previous and today’s meetings would benefit the economy if financial institutions took active roles in addressing liquidity problems of borrowers, especially SMEs and households, as well as accelerating debt restructuring to have monitor each financial institution’s assistance to borrowers.",
        "The Committee also saw a need to have measures to enhance liquidity in the financial markets which was likely to be tightening.",
        "consider implementing other measures in addition to government bond purchases to support and sustain liquidity in the financial markets to ensure stability and the well-functioning of the financial markets."

        "Meanwhile, the euro area exhibited slightly weaker momentum, with exports slowing down in line with global trade volume and further restrained by private sector confidence that was weighed down by political issues.",
        "Japan expanded broadly in line with the previous assessment on the back of accelerated private consumption prior to the consumption tax increase.",
        "China would likely expand at a slower pace.",
        "Nevertheless, the Chinese government continued implementing measures to support growth.",
        "The government attempted at the same time to strike a balance between its economic growth and financial stability objectives, and this resulted in some improvements in market confidence.",
        "Asian economies would grow at a slower pace due to impacts from trade protectionism measures between the US and China, tightening financial conditions, and less fiscal stimulus in some economies.",
        "However, increases in minimum wages in several countries would continuously support expansion of private consumption.",
        "With regard to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) still gradually tightened its policy stance.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) gradually reduced the degree of policy accommodation by ending new bond purchases at the end of 2018 as previously announced.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was expected to maintain accommodative policy stance for some time.",
        "Other central banks in the region, such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, tightened monetary policy to preserve price stability or to preserve external stability such as Bank Indonesia.",
        "The Committee viewed the likelihood of trading partner growth being lower than the baseline forecast increased given risks from trade protectionism measures as well as uncertainties pertaining to Brexit that could impact the global economy and financial markets.",
        "Hence, the Committee saw a need to closely monitor developments of those risks and the impacts on the growth outlook of trading partners, in particular economic activities as reflected in labor market indicators.",
        "Movements of most asset prices and currencies in the intermeeting period were volatile due to growing investor concerns about the global economic outlook, uncertainties pertaining to the Fed’s rate hike, trade protectionism measures between the US and China, and the lack of clarity regarding the Brexit deal.",
        "Nevertheless, Thai financial markets remained attractive to foreign investors thanks to sound fundamentals and strong external stability.",
        "This resulted in (1) sustained net capital inflows to the Thai bond market and (2) a relatively - 2 smaller amount of net equity outflows compared with other emerging markets.",
        "On exchange rates, most regional currencies appreciated, especially currencies of those economies that benefitted from lower oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, compared with regional currencies, the baht was largely stable against the US dollar.",
        "The Committee viewed that the global financial markets remained highly uncertain in the period ahead due to factors such as (1) the monetary policy outlook in advanced economies, pertaining to Brexit as well as political issues in the euro area that could intensify and affect the global economy and cross-border capital flows.",
        "This could put pressures on asset prices and exchange rates.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments of financial markets and exchange rates as well as impacts on the Thai economy going forward.",
        "The Thai economy was expected to continue gaining traction, expanding at a level consistent with its potential, driven by domestic demand despite the slowdown in external demand.",
        "Private consumption was expected to continue expanding across all product categories thanks to (1) more broad-based increases in almost all income groups of nonagricultural households and (2) additional supports from government measures such as the first and second phases of the social welfare card scheme.",
        "However, farm income slightly decreased due mainly to lower agricultural prices, and consumption was still restrained by elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment was expected to further expand thanks to the clarity on the public-private partnership (PPP) for the Eastern Economic Corridor (ECC) infrastructure investment projects.",
        "Investment was also driven by the relocation of production base of foreign corporations in some export-oriented industries to Thailand.",
        "Public expenditure was expected to grow at a slower pace.",
        "This was due to (1) delayed investments in the second phase of dual-track railway project which were under review with regard to project priority, (2) delays in the drafting of master plans under the National Strategy that prompted government agencies to defer obligation of funds for some projects, and (3) delayed approval of land expropriation expenses for the Bang YaiKanchanaburi motorway project.",
        "Meanwhile, external demand momentum was projected to moderate.",
        "The value of merchandise exports would expand at a slower pace due to various factors including the global trade slowdown, trade protectionism measures between the US and China that affected trading partner economies, and the plateauing electronics cycle.",
        "Nevertheless, benefits from the redirected orders and the relocation of production base to Thailand would partly offset the impact.",
        "Exports of services also moderated due to the slower-than-expected recovery in the number of Chinese tourists given an additional drag from China’s economic slowdown and the renminbi depreciation.",
        "Going forward, the number of tourists was expected to steadily increase but there remained challenges due to constrained airport capacity.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy to expand in 2018 and 2019 albeit at a slower pace going forward in tandem with the external demand slowdown, while domestic demand would continue to gain traction.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to grow at 4.2 and 4.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively.",
        "This was revised down from the previous assessment of 4.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively.",
        "Risks to the growth projection remained tilted to the downside.",
        "There were possibilities that Thai economy would expand at a rate - 3 below the baseline projection due mainly to external factors.",
        "These included (1) the U.S. trade protectionism measures that could be further intensified and (2) volatilities in the global financial markets in the case of no-deal Brexit.",
        "There were also downside risks on the domestic front, including (1) private consumption growth that could be lower than expected as domestic purchasing power had yet to increase in a broad-based manner, particularly due to farm income that could fall more than expected, and (2) public investment that could be lower than projected given some constraints in budget disbursement and project execution.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the economic outlook as well as factors that could make the outlook different from the baseline projection.",
        "The Committee viewed that, despite growth moderating, the overall economy performed in line with its potential.",
        "Private consumption and private investment were in the early phase of expansion, and several factors continued to support household income.",
        "Likewise, exports of goods and services started to show signs of improvement.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would monitor the continuity of employment, the outlook for private consumption and export orders, as well as risks pertaining to trade protectionism measures between the US and China.",
        "Headline inflation in September and November 2018 was slightly higher than previously assessed on account of an increase in energy prices and a decline of fresh food prices to a lesser extent than previously expected owing to damaged vegetable supply following an epidemic outbreak.",
        "Core inflation also turned out higher than expected on the back of prepared food prices.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that headline inflation was broadly in line with the previous assessment and thus maintained the projection for headline inflation for 2018 at 1.1 percent while slightly lowered the projection for 2019 to 1.0 percent from 1.1 percent.",
        "This was mainly attributable to global crude oil prices that were expected to decline.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation would likely rise with the projection kept at 0.7 percent for 2018 and revised to 0.9 percent for 2019, up from the previous assessment of 0.8 percent.",
        "This was owing to a gradual increase in demand-pull inflationary pressures, coupled with increased bus fares as approved by the central committee governing land transport.",
        "Nevertheless, risks to the headline and core inflation forecasts remained tilt to the downside, consistent with risks to the economic projection and in line with oil and fresh food prices that could be lower than expected.",
        "The Committee assessed the Thai economy to continue gaining traction on the back of domestic demand, while external demand slightly slowed down.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to be broadly in line with the previous assessment.",
        "However, downside risks increased given volatile energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to edge up gradually in tandem with economic expansion.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall, and risks in some areas had been addressed to a certain extent by macroprudential measures such as prudential measures on credit card loans and personal loans under regulation, revision in the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans, and the National Legislate Assembly’s approval of amendments to the Cooperatives Act with respect to supervision and regulation of saving cooperatives.",
        "Nevertheless, most Committee members - 4 viewed that the need for extra accommodative monetary policy as in the previous period had reduced, and that the policy rate increase at this meeting would help curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system in conjunction with the macroprudential measures already implemented.",
        "Thus, the Committee voted 5 to 2 to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.50 to 1.75 percent.",

        "Despite moderating merchandise export growth attributable to impacts from trade protectionism measures between the US and China, tourism started to show signs of improvement thanks to a gradual rise in the number of Chinese tourists.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand continued to increase, particularly on account of private consumption that expanded on the back of increasingly broad-based improvement in non-farm income as well as additional supports from government measures.",
        "Private investment was expected to expand due to the relocation of production base to Thailand and PPP infrastructure investment projects which showed signs of continued progress.",
        "However, the Thai economy still faced downside risks arising from the external front, particularly from trade protectionism measures between the US and China.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that the economy was sufficiently strong and would expand at the level consistent with its potential.",
        "Consequently, the economy should be able to accommodate the policy rate increase at this meeting.",
        "Furthermore, a gradual reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation would not hinder economic expansion in the period ahead; it would instead reduce financial stability risks and that should be conducive to sustainable economic growth in the long run.",
        "The need for accommodative monetary policy as in the previous period had thus reduced.",
        "In addition, whenever appropriate, as at this meeting, a policy rate increase would help build policy space.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members viewed that the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance remained necessary to support the continuation of economic growth in order to (1) further strengthen private consumption and investment that would be drivers for Thailand’s growth momentum in the period ahead amid external uncertainties and (2) enable the Thai economy to expand so that the benefits of growth percolating to a larger section of the economy.",

        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to edge up in tandem with the economic outlook.",
        "According to the Committee’s assessment the current accommodative monetary policy had allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Nevertheless, structural changes such as impacts from the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and productivity upgrades that reduced production costs all could induce inflation to rise at a slower pace than in the past despite the continued expansion of the Thai economy.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall, with some risks in the financial system addressed to a certain extent by the macroprudential measures already implemented.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee saw a need to monitor developments in the mortgage loan market as well as adjustments in the real estate sector, particularly during the period prior to - 5 the revision in the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans becoming effective in April financial market that could pose vulnerabilities in the future.",
        "These included, first, household debt that, despite gradually declining, remained high relative to that of emerging markets.",
        "Meanwhile, auto loans were expected to continue accelerating.",
        "Moreover, the prolonged low interest rates could affect savings going forward, particularly in the situation where the Thai economy was becoming an aging society.",
        "Second, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "For example, saving cooperatives continued to provide high returns to members, resulting in high growth of assets held by saving cooperatives that could consequently pressure them to search for higher returns.",
        "Furthermore, large saving cooperatives now played a greater role compared with the past in the cooperative system by increasingly engaging in extending loans to other saving cooperatives.",
        "Meanwhile, given the prolonged low interest rate environment, large corporates sought a greater amount of funding through both commercial bank loans and the bond market and invested in both core and non-core businesses including some overseas enterprises.",
        "These risks would be more closely monitored.",
        "In the Committee’s view, an appropriate mix of policy instruments, both the policy interest rate and macroprudential measures, was necessary to efficiently address financial stability.",
        "Most Committee members determined that the prolonged low interest rate could lead to persistent build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system, and thus the policy rate increase at this meeting would help rebalancing consumption, saving, borrowing, and investment and would also support sustainability of economic expansion in the long run, particularly in view of the fact that Thailand was becoming an aging society.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding impacts of the policy rate hike on households, businesses, and financial institutions, and also considered the fiscal policy outlook with continued budget deficits.",
        "In this light, the Committee viewed that the policy rate at 1.75 percent would remain accommodative and conducive to growth across economic sectors.",
        "The Committee would monitor policy transmission to deposit and lending rates of financial institutions, especially with market liquidity remaining high, as well as short-term money market rates, particularly short-term bond yields that had already edged up.",
        "This should ensure that Thai economy would sustainably expand in line with its potential.",
        "The Committee discussed the outlook for monetary policy.",
        "The Committee viewed that accommodative monetary policy would remain appropriate in the period ahead, and that the policy rate increase would be gradual and not in a continuous manner as in the past.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee’s evaluation of the appropriate conditions would be data dependent, including careful assessment of the outlook for growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead.",
        "Paiboon Kittisrikangwan Thailand’s trading partner economies continued to grow in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to expand mainly on the back of private consumption as employment and consumer confidence continued to improve.",
        "Although consumption was somewhat dampened by unfavorable weather conditions, it was expected to gain traction in the period ahead.",
        "China and Asian economies showed sustained growth driven primarily by exports thanks to strong global demand.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies, especially in advanced economies, was increasing on the back of energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation in emerging market economies remained subdued.",
        "The Committee viewed that downside risks to economic growth of trading partners due mainly to risks associated with US economic and foreign trade policies as well as possible retaliation from US trading partners were mostly unchanged from the previous assessment.",
        "Geopolitical risks remained largely unchanged, as tension declined in the Korean Peninsula but escalated in the Middle East.",
        "According to the Committee’s preliminary assessment, US foreign trade policies and possible retaliation from US trading partners would have a limited impact on the Thai economy and trading partners, with the impact varying across product groups.",
        "Nevertheless, the impact on supply chains and Thai businesses would be complex and difficult to assess.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments of trade policies and negotiations as they could have stronger impacts than anticipated.",
        "Moreover, there might also be a significant impact on private sector confidence about investment, foreign trade, and financial market conditions.",
        "Investors in global financial markets maintained a cautious stance.",
        "Despite having declined from earlier this year, asset price volatility remained high compared with last year, causing global financial markets to continue to be sensitive.",
        "This is attributable to (1) the 10-year US Treasury yield now exceeding 3 percent, a four-year high, thanks to increased US inflation expectations and stronger US economic performance relative to other countries especially Europe, (2) uncertainties surrounding US trade policies, and (3) geopolitical risks.",
        "These factors led to US dollar appreciation and risk-off sentiments among investors, particularly toward investments in risky assets and emerging markets.",
        "As a result, investors began a selloff in these bond and stock markets.",
        "Countries with vulnerable economic fundamentals, such as Argentina, Turkey, and Indonesia, were significantly affected by capital outflows.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht depreciated against the US dollar, in the same direction as most regional currencies, in light of the US dollar’s movements and seasonal outflows from Thailand due to the repatriation of foreign investors’ dividends during the second quarter of the year.",
        "Thus, - 2 volatility of the baht increased.",
        "However, the currency’s movements relative to those of trading partner currencies in the previous period were largely unchanged.",
        "Short-term Thai government bond yields rose due to selling pressures from foreign investors and an increase slightly edged up as their US counterparts increased.",
        "Nevertheless, long-term Thai government bond yields did not materially change given the bond supply and the low inflation outlook.",
        "Looking ahead, the baht would likely experience volatile movements mainly due to uncertainties pertaining to the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies in advanced economies as well as geopolitical risks and oil prices.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor these developments and their potential impacts on exchange rates and the economy going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that risks associated with uncertainties pertaining to US trade policies could affect global trade and financial markets more than market participants anticipated both in terms of asset prices and investor confidence.",
        "The Committee also noted that there were signs of tightening global financial conditions—in particular, the acceleration in US Treasury yields at a pace that induced risk-off sentiments among investors—after financial conditions remained highly accommodative for a prolonged period.",
        "This might pose a risk that liquidity in the global financial markets going forward might tighten at a faster pace than observed in the past two years.",
        "The Thai economy gained further traction and recorded higher growth than previously assessed driven by expansion in the external sector and a gradual improvement in domestic demand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports improved both in terms of quantity thanks to robust growth in external demand and in terms of prices on the back of rising global crude oil prices.",
        "Exports of services continued to expand in line with the number of tourists partly due to (1) the launch of direct flight routes from Chinese secondary cities to Thailand and (2) airlines working to accommodate more tourists despite airport capacity constraints.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand increasingly played a significant role in supporting economic growth.",
        "Private consumption gradually expanded, driven primarily by middle- and high- income households, and employment showed signs of improvement.",
        "Furthermore, private investment growth was projected to rise due to developments pertaining to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) initiative and the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme, after the cabinet approved the high-speed rail project linking three main airports, which helped boost investor confidence.",
        "Despite some delays in budget disbursement, public expenditure continued to lend support to economic growth as the supplementary budget for fiscal year the effects of the enforcement of the Public Procurement and Supplies Management Act, B.E.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion and viewed that the positive spillovers of overall economic expansion to the labor market and private consumption remained limited to export-related sectors, while the strength of income growth among agricultural and low- income households still warranted close monitoring going forward.",
        "The increase in nonagricultural household income was concentrated in the middle- and high-income households, which supported growth in durable goods consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, low-income households still lived on stagnant earnings, with elevated household debt remaining a drag on - 3 consumption.",
        "For agricultural households, although agricultural output expanded, purchasing power started to improve only in product groups that experienced higher prices, such as jasmine rice and cassava.",
        "Regarding the labor market, which acted as a key channel for overall macroeconomic growth to trickle down to household spending at the micro level, there were structural challenges in the labor market such as automation in the production processes, limited skill flexibility that constrained mobility across industries, and job search by graduates that increasingly took longer time.",
        "The Committee viewed that such problems must be tackled by structural policies in order for labor skills and incomes to improve and better align with a fast-changing economy with respect to technology, business models, and demography.",
        "Headline inflation gradually rose in March and April 2018 as previously assessed thanks to the continued increase in energy prices.",
        "However, domestic oil prices were partially subsidized by a reduction in the refining cost premium as well as reduced contribution to the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund maintained by the Committee on Energy Policy Administration.",
        "Fresh food prices remained low due to high agricultural output thanks to favorable weather.",
        "Core inflation increased slightly on the back of higher housing rents.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to slowly trend up on account of gradual expansion of domestic demand and rising oil prices.",
        "However, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low, resulting in a slow increase in core inflation.",
        "In addition, structural changes such as technological developments, an expansion of e-commerce, and heightened price competition, would cause inflation to rise more slowly than in the past.",
        "Nevertheless, long-term inflation expectations saw a slight increase.",
        "Commercial bank loans continued to expand in line with economic growth, especially large loans extended to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which increased across a broader range of businesses.",
        "Smaller SME loans, however, remained largely unchanged.",
        "Meanwhile, large corporates continued to make significant amounts of loan repayments.",
        "Nevertheless, loans extended to large corporates expanded in certain businesses, in particular real estate where financing increased through loans, bonds, and equities.",
        "Consumer loans expanded in all purposes, particularly auto loans.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the overall non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained stable from the previous quarter.",
        "However, NPLs of some SMEs warranted monitoring, despite credit quality of SMEs loans starting to improve in a broad range of businesses in line with overall economic growth as reflected in a decline in migration rates of normal loans to special-mentioned and non-performing loans.",
        "Going forward, credit quality of consumer loans still warranted monitoring as NPLs continued to rise across all purposes except auto loans.",
        "Furthermore, commercial banks began to raise more deposits to prepare for economic growth in the period ahead as well as an interest rate upcycle.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that might lead to a build-up of vulnerability in financial system going forward.",
        "Regarding leverage, the seasonally adjusted ratio of household debt to GDP continued to decline gradually albeit remaining at a high level in the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "Debt serviceability of households remained an issue to be monitored, particularly among low-income households with high proportion of debt to financial assets.",
        "The ratio of non-financial corporate debt to GDP remained unchanged but corporate financing through long-term debt increased, which were mostly investment grade in financial, real estate, and food sectors.",
        "In any case, financial institutions remained cautious in extending loans to both businesses and households and - 4 were more stringent in SME loans and auto leasing.",
        "Regarding asset prices, volatilities of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index increased somewhat in line with global financial conditions, with the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) largely unchanged.",
        "The overall house price index continued to rise albeit at a slow pace.",
        "Property owners increased their financing through commercial banks and the bond market, reflecting continued investment.",
        "Meanwhile, commercial banks competed more on providing mortgage loans within the middle-to-high price range consistent with the increase in the loan-to-value ratio (LTV).",
        "The search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment remained present as reflected in (1) an accelerated expansion of daily fixed income funds despite a slowdown of foreign investment funds (FIFs) for some time and (2) continued high growth in deposit and portfolio investment of saving cooperatives despite slowing down somewhat compared with the previous period due to more stringent regulations.",
        "The Committee extensively discussed the issue of household debt and viewed that, in general, economic recovery in other countries such as the US and South Korea would take place in conjunction with significant deleveraging.",
        "However, that Thailand’s elevated household debt declined at a slower pace partly reflected some structural problems that had yet to be fully resolved.",
        "In addition, some Committee members noted that the duration of consumer loans in Thailand was shorter on average compared with other countries.",
        "A longer loan’s term potentially would lead to lower monthly interest expenses and consequently would allow for higher disposable income available to households.",
        "Furthermore, some Committee members viewed that certain financial stability risks were self-correctable, while some other risks might warrant regulatory measures such as credit card and personal loan problems last year.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction and would grow at a higher rate than previously projected, driven by both the external sector and gradual improvements in domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to gradually rise in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system.",
        "The Committee considered the benefits and costs of policy alternatives and viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation to target in a sustainable manner, although the process could take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "(1) The Thai economy overall gained further traction, with domestic demand improving but not yet sufficiently strong in a broad-based manner.",
        "Growth continued to be driven by the external sector.",
        "Merchandise exports and the number of tourists continued to grow and started to trickle down to employment of related businesses.",
        "Private consumption, particularly on durable goods, steadily expanded.",
        "However, improved purchasing power had yet to fully extend to all economic sectors.",
        "The increase in farm income following higher agricultural output was a result of the low base.",
        "Earnings of low-income households remained - 5 fragile and dependent on government subsidies.",
        "Furthermore, household debt still weighed on private consumption and structural changes were taking place in the labor market.",
        "Private investment continued to improve in line with robust business confidence but was still contingent on budget public sector disbursement and investment going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, there remained risks on the external front especially uncertainties surrounding US foreign trade policies and retaliatory measures from major economies.",
        "Overall, the Committee viewed that growth development still warranted monitoring for some period.",
        "Accommodative monetary policy thus remained necessary to support more broad-based (2) Headline inflation gradually trended up in line with the previous assessment on the back of fuel prices following a continued increase in global oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, fresh food prices remained low.",
        "Core inflation slowly rose on account of a gradual improvement in domestic demand and an increase in the public’s inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee viewed that upward pressures on inflation in the period ahead might be lower than in the past, as wage increases had only limited effects on inflation, oil prices increases were partly compensated by subsidies, and increases in agricultural prices became less likely due to expansion in the agricultural land base worldwide.",
        "Moreover, firms were still profitable overall and able to cope with higher production costs without the need to pass on to consumers.",
        "The Committee would continue to closely monitor inflation developments going forward and viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy should support headline inflation to rise toward target in a sustainable manner, although the process might take some time.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that might result in the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system.",
        "Such risks included (1) the search-for-yield behavior especially in the prolonged low interest rate environment that could lead to underpricing of risks, (2) developments in saving cooperatives, (3) debt serviceability of households and SMEs, and (4) the property market in which businesses and financial institutions continued to invest and increasingly engaged in competition.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that macroprudential measures were appropriate for mitigating risks to financial stability.",
        "While others viewed that, as the policy interest rate would partly help prevent these risks from further developing and broadly affecting financial stability, it was thus an indispensable tool in preserving financial stability alongside macroprudential measures, as it would enhance effectiveness in safeguarding overall financial stability.",
        "In this light, the Committee unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.",
        "50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving financial stability.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies grew at a moderating pace as previously assessed.",
        "This was attributable to impacts of trade protectionism measures on global trade volume.",
        "Advanced economies would likely continue expanding, particularly the US economy which was supported by a robust labor market, strong consumer confidence, income tax cuts, and fiscal stimulus.",
        "The euro area was projected to expand, although private consumption could slow down as consumer confidence was weighed on by political uncertainties.",
        "Japan grew on the back of private consumption on account of a strong labor market, while private investment continued to expand despite the temporary impact of natural disasters during the third quarter.",
        "China would likely expand at a slower pace due to the Chinese government’s financial stability measures to lower debt.",
        "Nevertheless, the Chinese government continued to implement a series of measures to support economic growth.",
        "Asian economies were expected to moderate on account of exports and consumption, but government policies aimed at supporting investment would play a role in holding up growth to some extent.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies increased slowly mainly on the back of rising energy and fresh food prices, while core inflation was largely unchanged.",
        "With regard to monetary policy of trading partners, the Federal Reserve (Fed) continued with its tightening cycle as previously assessed, while the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) were expected to keep their accommodative monetary policy stance for some time.",
        "Monetary policy stance in Asia became increasingly diverging.",
        "Central banks in some countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia tightened monetary policy in order to stabilize rising inflation or to curb financial market volatilities, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, other central banks such as the People’s Bank of China still maintained accommodative monetary policy in response to slowing economic growth.",
        "The Committee viewed risks to trading partners’ growth largely unchanged from the previous assessment.",
        "Key risks included uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures by major economies, together with geopolitical risks that could cause volatilities in financial and commodity markets.",
        "Nevertheless, impacts of trade protectionism measures on the Chinese and Asian economies were expected to be more pronounced in the fourth quarter this year and would further escalate next year, as reflected in a decline in advance export orders and signs of trade diversion mainly in commodity markets.",
        "For instance, China increased imports of soybeans from Brazil and natural gas from Australia, Russia, and other countries, while the US started to export soybeans to Europe, Argentina, and other countries.",
        "In this regard, the Committee saw the need to closely monitor developments and assess impacts of trade protectionism measures between the US and China—both the negative effects on export and domestic markets as well as the positive effects due to investment diversion that could have a bearing on the manufacturing sector and the labor market in Thailand going forward.",
        "Concerns over US trade protectionism measures and a sooner‐than‐expected normalization by the Fed posed downward pressures on Asian currencies, especially the Chinese yuan and currencies of countries with a strong link with China.",
        "Nevertheless, foreign investors reallocated investments from vulnerable emerging markets to other economies, including Thailand, which had sound fundamentals and relatively stronger external stability.",
        "This resulted in capital inflows to Thailand’s long‐term bond market toward the end of October.",
        "Thus, long‐term bond yields declined.",
        "Meanwhile, short‐term bond yields rose on account of market expectations of future policy rate increases.",
        "With regard to equities, foreign investors continued to sell off emerging market stocks, but the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell relatively less than other emerging market indices due mainly to demand from domestic investors.",
        "On exchange rates, the baht was volatile against the US dollar and increasingly influenced by external factors.",
        "The Thai currency weakened in the same direction as regional currencies owing to rising concerns on risks to the global economy.",
        "The Committee viewed that the global financial markets remained highly uncertain in the period ahead due to key factors such as (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies and (2) trade protectionism measures that could be intensified and affect the global economy and cross‐border capital flows.",
        "This would put pressures on asset prices as well as exchange rates, especially of emerging markets with weak economic fundamentals and strong trade linkages with China and Europe.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments of financial markets and exchange rates as well as impacts on the economy going forward.",
        "The Thai economy would continue to gain traction.",
        "Despite signs of moderation in merchandise exports and tourism, domestic demand momentum continued to expand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports showed some signs of slowing down.",
        "This was partly owing to impacts from trade protectionism, the slowdown phase of electronic product life cycles, and temporary factors due to a typhoon affecting Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.",
        "Looking ahead, merchandise exports were expected to register slower growth as impacts from trade protectionism on external demand would be more pronounced.",
        "This was in line with a softer outlook of export indicators—both advance orders and imports of raw materials.",
        "Despite openings of new airline routes from many countries to Thailand toward the end of the year, exports of services would likely slow down mainly due to the lower number of Chinese tourists following the Phuket tour boat sinking incident, slowing growth of the Chinese economy, yuan depreciation, dengue outbreaks in the southern Thailand, and the Chinese government’s strengthened safety standards applied to countries favored by Chinese tourists.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand momentum increased.",
        "Private consumption continued to expand across all product categories in tandem with improved income and consumer confidence.",
        "In particular, increases in income of non‐agricultural households were increasingly broad‐based across all sectors and were sustained by government policies, including additional measures to support the low‐income elderly and value‐added tax refund for low‐income earners.",
        "However, purchasing power of consumers was still held down by elevated household debt and low prices of some agricultural products such as rubber, palm, and sugar cane.",
        "In addition, exports of agricultural products that were highly dependent on Chinese demand, such as cassava and rubber, might be affected by the Chinese economic slowdown as a result of trade protectionism measures.",
        "Private investment was expected to continue expanding on the back of increased clarity on public‐private partnerships (PPP) projects for infrastructure investments, improved business confidence, and the relocation of production base of foreign corporations in electronics industries to Thailand.",
        "Public expenditure was expected to moderate slightly due to delayed investment of some state‐ owned enterprises; for instance, the State Railway of Thailand was reassessing the relative priority of the seven routes in the second phase of dual‐track railway projects.",
        "Meanwhile, investment by the central government was expected to continue growing thanks to progress on construction of motorway projects and disbursements on supplementary budget for fiscal year 2018.",
        "The Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the outlook of exports in the period ahead as the global economy and global trade were subject to downside risks.",
        "Clearer signs of impacts of trade protectionism started to be observed.",
        "Chinese businesses began to gradually run down their inventories and reduce imports of raw materials due to concerns over trade protectionism measures by the US.",
        "As a result, Thailand’s exports of supply‐chain products such as hard disk drives, rubber, and rubber products to China were projected to contract.",
        "In addition, exports would likely be affected by the slowdown phase of electronic product cycles, particularly on account of a decline in demand for smart phones in the global market that turned out faster and greater than expected.",
        "However, the relocation of production base of electronics industries to Thailand would partly help alleviate such impacts.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that, although external demand began to slow down, an increasingly stronger domestic demand would play a role in driving Thailand’s growth in the period ahead.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would closely monitor those external impacts on merchandise exports and tourism.",
        "Headline and core inflation were slightly higher than previously assessed in September and October on account of (1) higher energy prices in line with global crude oil prices and (2) higher fresh food prices in all categories except prices of vegetables and fruits.",
        "This was due to a large agricultural output thanks to favorable weather conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, prepared food prices increased in tandem with rising transportation costs.",
        "Looking ahead, annual average headline inflation would likely increase at a gradual pace with greater downside risks due to volatile energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Core inflation was expected to rise slowly broadly in line with the previous assessment given gradual improvement in demand‐pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past.",
        "Such changes included impacts from the expansion of e‐commerce, rising price competition, as well as technological development which reduced costs of production.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor some pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future.",
        "With regard to leverage, while the seasonally adjusted household debt to GDP ratio fell slightly in the second quarter of 2018, it remained high relative to those of other emerging market economies.",
        "Credit quality of mortgage loans must be monitored as the non‐performing loan ratio (NPL) remained at a high level.",
        "Household debt accumulation must also be monitored, particularly mortgage loans in the period before the revision in the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans[1] would become effective as well as auto loans where credit standards became looser due to increasing competition.",
        "As a result, deleveraging could occur only slowly.",
        "Meanwhile, the non‐financial corporation debt to GDP ratio continued to decline.",
        "Private businesses turned to raise funds through commercial banks instead of the bond market; however, large corporates would continue to increasingly raise funds through the bond market.",
        "Debt serviceability of small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) with rising NPLs must still be monitored, particularly businesses affected by structural changes such as rice mills and wholesale and retail businesses.",
        "With regard to asset prices, volatilities of the SET index rose in tandem with global markets, while the price‐earnings ratio (P/E ratio) fell slightly below a historical average.",
        "In addition, tightening financial conditions could lead to higher borrowing costs in the bond market and affect debt rollovers, particularly in the case of companies issuing bonds with low credit rating or unrated bonds that were mostly in the real estate sector.",
        "With regard to the property sector, the house price index increased but did not accelerate.",
        "Demand for real estate continued to expand, especially condominium purchases driven in part by foreign demand mostly from Hong Kong, China, and Singapore.",
        "The Committee saw the need to monitor developments of foreign demand in the period ahead as there remained risks of a possible decline in demand following the Chinese economic slowdown.",
        "As for developers, funds were increasingly raised in the low interest rate environment through commercial banks as well as the bond market.",
        "This would increase debt rollover risks as financial conditions became tightened.",
        "Meanwhile, commercial banks started to compete to a lesser extent in extending mortgage loans and now accepted somewhat lower credit risks.",
        "However, the share of new mortgage loans with high loan‐to‐income (LTI) ratios was still rising, while the debt‐to‐service ratios (DSR) of low‐income households remained elevated.",
        "The search‐for‐yield behavior remained present in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "This was evident in a persistently high asset growth among saving cooperatives, as some large saving cooperatives increasingly engaged in taking deposits and lending to other cooperatives, as well as increased investment in both equities and debt instruments.",
        "Such tighter linkages contributed to further build‐up of vulnerabilities.",
        "Investment in mutual funds grew at a slower pace, which was in part due to a decline in foreign investment fund (FIF) investment since the previous year.",
        "The Committee discussed risks to the financial system arising from the prolonged low interest rate as well as approaches to address and prevent such risks that included elevated household debts, rising competition in the mortgage loan market, expansion of saving cooperatives, debt serviceability of SMEs, and acceleration in borrowing by large corporates.",
        "The Committee judged that the Thai economy continued to gain traction.",
        "Despite signs of moderating external demand, domestic demand continued to expand.",
        "The annual average headline inflation was expected to rise gradually in line with the previous assessment.",
        "However, downside risks increased given volatile energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to edge up slowly as previously assessed.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall despite some pockets of risks which warranted monitoring.",
        "Risks arising from competition in the mortgage loan market, which led to looser credit standards, were addressed to a certain extent by the revision in the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans in order both to upgrade financial institutions’ credit underwriting standards to better reflect risks and to pre‐empt systematic risks.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would closely monitor developments in the mortgage loan market and adjustments in the property sector, particularly in the period before the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans would become effective, as well as monitor build‐up of vulnerabilities in other pockets resulting from the prolonged period of accommodative financial conditions.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee voted 4 to 3 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent.",
        "Three members voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 percent.",
        "The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "(1) The Thai economy continued to gain traction despite some signs of moderating export growth.",
        "This was in part attributable to impacts from trade protectionism measures between the US and China, the slowdown phase of electronics product life cycles, and trading partner countries’ weather conditions which were temporary factors.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand momentum increased, particularly on account of private consumption that continued to expand on the back of improvement in income and strong consumer confidence.",
        "Private investment was expected to expand thanks to the relocation of production base to Thailand and a greater clarity on PPP infrastructure investment projects.",
        "However, the Thai economy still encountered increased downside risks arising from impacts from trade protectionism that could be greater than expected as well as from geopolitical risks.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained necessary to support the continuation of economic growth.",
        "In particular, the Thai economy still faced downside risks from impacts of trade protectionism measures which were highly uncertain and a slowdown of tourism.",
        "In addition, the strength of private consumption and investment, which would be Thailand’s growth momentum in the period ahead, must be monitored.",
        "Meanwhile, some Committee members viewed that the economy was sufficiently robust and would not significantly slow down.",
        "Therefore, a gradual reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation at this juncture would not much affect economic growth.",
        "Instead, it would reduce financial stability risks, and that would be conducive to sustainable economic growth in the long term.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was expected to rise gradually.",
        "However, downside risks remained owing to volatile energy and fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to edge up broadly in line with the previous assessment given the gradual build‐up of demand‐ pull inflationary pressures.",
        "This was partly a result of structural changes such as the expansion of e‐commerce, rising price competition, and productivity upgrades that reduced production costs, all of which could result in more persistent inflation than in the past.",
        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy had allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "The Committee also viewed that a prolonged period of low inflation was due mainly to supply‐side factors and structural changes despite the economy continuing to expand.",
        "As such, some Committee members viewed that maintaining the current level of monetary policy accommodation would not help accelerate inflation.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but some pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability warranted monitoring going forward.",
        "According to the Committee’s assessment, risks pertaining to competition in the mortgage loan market were addressed to a certain extent through the revision in the macroprudential measure on mortgage loans.",
        "In any case, the Committee would monitor the following risks going forward.",
        "First, although the household debt to GDP ratio gradually declined, it remained high relative to that of emerging markets.",
        "Credit quality of mortgage loans had yet to improve and auto loans were expected to accelerate.",
        "Moreover, the prolonged low interest rate could affect savings going forward.",
        "Second, other types of search‐for‐yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "For example, savings cooperatives continued to provide high returns to members, resulting in high growth of their assets that could pressure them to search for higher returns.",
        "Meanwhile, large saving cooperatives played a greater role in the saving cooperative system by increasingly engaged in extending loans to other saving cooperatives.",
        "Moreover, given the prolonged low interest rate environment, large corporates accelerated their funding through both commercial banks and the bond market in order to invest in both existing and non‐core businesses including some overseas businesses.",
        "Therefore, these risks would be more closely monitored.",
        "The Committee viewed that an appropriate mix of policy instruments, both policy interest rate and macroprudential measures, was necessary to effectively address stability in the financial system.",
        "However, macroprudential measures could not be employed in place of monetary policy, as macroprudential measures were rather complementary measures to address pockets of risks.",
        "Some Committee members concerned that vulnerabilities that began to build up in the financial system would affect sustainable economic growth in the long term.",
        "They viewed that vulnerabilities in the financial system started to become more widespread due partly to the prolonged low interest rate environment, which would induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions.",
        "Therefore, monetary policy should play a role in preserving financial stability in conjunction with macroprudential measures.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed conditions and appropriate timing to begin normalizing monetary policy in the future.",
        "The Committee viewed that, should economic expansion continue and inflation move within the target, the need for currently extra accommodative monetary policy would start to be gradually reduced, while the need to have policy space to cushion against possible risks to growth in the future would be increasing.",
        "The Committee’s evaluation of the appropriate conditions would be data dependent, including careful assessment of the outlook of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability risks, to support an appropriate monetary policy consideration going forward.",
        "The global economy overall continued to expand.",
        "Thailand’s trading partners performed as previously assessed.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to grow steadily, driven primarily by manufacturing production and improved consumer confidence.",
        "China and Asian economies showed sustained growth, mainly on the back of exports, manufacturing production, and increased consumer confidence.",
        "Meanwhile, China’s economy experienced some deceleration due to slower economic activity over the Chinese New Year holiday.",
        "Global financial conditions remained accommodative as overall government bond yields were still lower than historical averages despite some spike during market correction.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies was increasing gradually, with US inflation likely to rise toward target.",
        "Inflation in the euro area and Japan remained low, while inflation in most Asian economies was within the target range.",
        "Most trading partner central banks maintained accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic expansion and gradual rise in inflation.",
        "Some Asian central banks could delay policy rate hikes relative to the previous assessment given moderate expansion in the domestic economy.",
        "The Committee viewed that, despite a decline in geopolitical risks, the balance of risks to global economic growth was skewed to the downside due mainly to risks associated with US economic and foreign trade policies as well as possible retaliation from US trading partners.",
        "According to the Committee’s preliminary assessment the latest US safeguard measures, such as the tariffs on steel and aluminum, would have a limited direct impact on the US and trading partner economies in the short term.",
        "However, indirect impacts warranted monitoring going forward.",
        "For instance, trade protectionism in certain goods might result in accelerated US inflation, which might affect monetary policy decision of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the volatility in global financial markets.",
        "There might also be impacts on international supply chains as well as on Thai exports.",
        "Furthermore, Thai domestic businesses could face increased competition if trade partners of the US diverted their exports to Thailand.",
        "Overall sentiments in global financial markets improved, but heightened asset prices volatility caused risk-off sentiments among investors amid developments in US trade policies and the US monetary policy outlook.",
        "After market correction, US Treasury yields stabilized while global equity indices gained slightly.",
        "Moreover, foreign investors started to sell off assets in some regional bond and stock markets.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht experienced heightened volatility and appreciated against the US dollar since the previous meeting in the same direction as most regional currencies.",
        "However, the pace of appreciation varied in accordance with country-specific factors.",
        "Thai government bond yields did not materially change.",
        "Rising US Treasury yields had limited effects on Thai government bond yields and - 2 financing costs through corporate bonds, as reflected in the modest outflows from the Thai bond market.",
        "US dollar liquidity tightened in some instances but did not cause significant movements in global financial markets.",
        "Overall, private financing costs remained low.",
        "Looking ahead, the baht would likely undergo volatile movements due mainly to uncertainties pertaining to the conduct of monetary, fiscal, and trade policies in advanced economies.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to monitor closely developments in the foreign exchange markets.",
        "The Committee noted that, if excess liquidity in the global financial system were to significantly decline in the period ahead, less accommodative monetary policy stance in advanced economies could have a stronger impact on the global financial markets than previously.",
        "This could in turn affect dollar liquidity in Thai financial markets and potentially raise financing costs in the Thai bond market.",
        "The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction and was expected to achieve higher growth than the previous assessment due particularly to continued improvements in merchandise exports and tourism driven by stronger global economic growth.",
        "Merchandise exports continued to improve both in terms of quantity and prices.",
        "Tourism expanded further due to a higher-than-expected number of Chinese tourists, together with Indian tourists which were projected to pick up further after the increased capacity entitlements under bilateral air services agreements.",
        "Furthermore, capacity constraints in the main airport were somewhat eased by the use of local airports.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, private consumption improved only gradually as household income in some agricultural sectors was affected by a decline in agricultural prices.",
        "Meanwhile, income among non-agricultural low-income households was largely unchanged due partly to migration of workers from the manufacturing sector to the services sector, which yielded relatively lower productivity.",
        "Meanwhile, household debt remained elevated.",
        "Nevertheless, income among non-agricultural households with medium-to-high income picked up further in line with improvements in the overall economic growth, which partly contributed to continued expansion of services and durable goods consumption.",
        "Private investment continued to improve particularly in machinery and equipment in line with increased capacity utilization among various industries such as automobiles, chemicals, and construction materials.",
        "Going forward, the increasing value of investment applications submitted to the Board of Investment, and investment incentives offered by the government particularly infrastructure investment as well as the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) initiative would sustain private investment going forward.",
        "Public expenditure remained a growth driver while there were risks from lower and delayed budget disbursement compared with the previous assessment.",
        "This was due in part to the promulgation of the Public Procurement and Supplies Management Act, B.E.",
        "2560 which might cause government and related agencies to take longer time than expected to be accustomed as well as construction delay in some government investment projects such as certain motorways and the mass rapid transit projects.",
        "The Committee projected that the Thai economy would continue to gain further traction and achieve higher growth than the previous assessment.",
        "The growth forecast for 2018 was revised to 4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent, with continued growth momentum at 4.1 percent in 2019.",
        "The upward revision was mainly on account of continued improvements in merchandise exports and tourism thanks to stronger trading partners’ growth.",
        "Meanwhile, private expenditure gradually expanded, which would be partly supported by the government - 3 measures aimed at improving the well-being of low-income households.",
        "Nevertheless, risks to the growth projection tilted to the downside due importantly to risks pertaining to (1) US economic and foreign trade policies as well as retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US that could affect Thailand’s export momentum, (2) budget disbursement by the government that could turn out lower and further delayed than the previous assessment—in particular, budget disbursement by local authorities, and (3) private demand that might not be as strong as expected should the recovery in purchasing power still not sufficiently broaden.",
        "Nevertheless, there were upside risks that could induce higher-than-expected economic growth.",
        "These included (1) trading partners’ growth which might be stronger than previously expected given benefits from the US tax reform, (2) additional economic measures from the Chinese government that could soften China’s economic slowdown, and (3) domestic infrastructure investment that might induce higher private investment than the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion on various factors that could affect Thailand’s growth outlook.",
        "First, while overall export growth was expected to be steady due particularly to stronger global economic expansion, it was subject to heightened volatility in exchange rates driven by external factors.",
        "Second, private consumption was not sufficiently strong, attributable to household income in some agricultural sectors that were affected by lower agricultural prices as well as declines in hours worked observed in daily workers outside the agricultural sector and monthly workers in services and construction sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate started to rise owing to structural factors as reflected in newly graduated students taking longer time in seeking jobs.",
        "Nevertheless, improvements in employment were still concentrated in some manufacturing and services sectors related to tourism, reflecting economic growth that had yet to fully transmit in a broad-based manner.",
        "In addition, household debt remained elevated.",
        "These problems need to be tackled by Headline inflation edged down in February 2018 owing to a decline in fresh food prices, following increased output, and a slowdown in energy price increases.",
        "Core inflation slightly increased due particularly to higher prices of housing rents and personal goods.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation was projected to gradually rise on account of domestic demand recovery and higher oil prices relative to the previous year.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low and were subject to structural changes that caused inflation to rise more slowly than in the past.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s short-term inflation expectations appeared to be more stable.",
        "The Committee slightly revised down the headline inflation forecast for 2018 to 1.0 percent and projected headline inflation for 2019 to rise to 1.2 percent.",
        "This was owing to lower fresh food prices following falling pork prices stemming from a large supply in the market as well as lower fruit prices given high agricultural output amid favorable weather.",
        "The core inflation forecast for 2018 was slightly revised down, averaging 0.7 percent this year, while the forecast for 2019 was expected to be an annual average of 0.8 percent, given the gradual improvements in domestic demand that did not lead to the acceleration in the domestic price level.",
        "Risks to the inflation projection tilted to the downside consistent with the risks to economic projection.",
        "Commercial bank loans grew at a similar pace as the end of last year.",
        "A broad range of businesses saw an expansion especially in consumer loans on the back of auto leasing.",
        "Loans extended to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) picked up and in some regions spread across a broader range of businesses, especially manufacturing, construction, and services - 4 sectors, thanks to overall economic expansion.",
        "Business loans to large corporates contracted due partly to debt repayment and a shift toward bond and equity financing.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the overall non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained stable, given the sluggish improvement in NPL of SME and consumer loans across all loan purposes, reflecting economic expansion that was not yet sufficiently broad-based.",
        "NPL of some SMEs decreased slightly, especially in exports and services sectors, in line with economic recovery.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee would closely monitor development of NPL of SMEs, as partially reflecting a more broad-based benefits of continued economic recovery.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would gain further traction and achieve stronger growth than the previous assessment, driven by external sectors as well as the gradual improvement in domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, developments in domestic demand still warranted close monitoring.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to gradually rise albeit at a slightly slower pace than the previous assessment.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth as reflected in low levels of real interest rates.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward.",
        "The Committee considered the benefits and impacts of policy alternatives and viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, six Committee members voted to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent.",
        "Their conclusions of key considerations were as follows.",
        "(1) The overall Thai economy gained further traction and achieve stronger growth, with domestic demand improving but not sufficiently strong.",
        "Economic growth was mainly driven by external demand from both merchandise and services exports and began to widen out to more related sectors.",
        "However, improvements in private investment were still concentrated in the sectors related to exports and tourism.",
        "Moreover, private consumption continued to expand at a gradual pace, achieving lower growth than the overall economic expansion.",
        "This was because (1) household income of those in the agricultural sector and those with lower income in the non-agricultural sector had yet to recover, (2) household debt among lowincome earners remained elevated, and (3) the labor market was not sufficiently strong and was affected by structural problems.",
        "As a result, purchasing power of low-income households was not sufficiently strong.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that private consumption would thus have to be monitored for some time.",
        "Overall, the Committee viewed that the current level of monetary policy accommodation was still necessary to foster stronger (2) Headline inflation gradually trended up on the back of recovery in domestic demand and oil prices despite a greater-than-expected decline in fresh food prices that contributed to a slightly slower increase in headline inflation than the previous assessment.",
        "Core inflation rose slowly as domestic demand recovered at a gradual pace.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that the slower-than-expected increase in headline inflation did not reflect deflation risks as decline in headline inflation was mainly attributable to supply-side factors.",
        "In addition, the public’s inflation expectations remained close to the target, and the economy continued - 5 to expand.",
        "However, the Committee would continue to closely monitor inflation developments going forward.",
        "In their view, the current level of monetary policy accommodation would foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the (3) Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system.",
        "The Committee noted signs of improvements in some financial stability risks as reflected in, for instance, lower NPLs seen in some businesses and some regions.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee was still concerned about the search-for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks, debt serviceability of households and SMEs, developments in saving cooperatives, and a real estate oversupply along the mass rapid transit routes as well as new openings of high-end condominiums and mixed-used real estate projects in the coming years.",
        "One Committee member voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 percent.",
        "In deliberating the decision, the member viewed that prolonged monetary accommodation would induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, while gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation in a timely manner would not hinder economic growth or price stability but would rather reduce financial stability risks in the future as well as facilitate monetary policy In this light, the Committee assessed policy trade-offs and voted 6 to 1 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving financial",
        "The global economy overall continued to expand.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies recorded stronger growth than the previous assessment, mainly on the back of consumption and employment in advanced economies as well as manufacturing production and exports in China and the Asian region.",
        "Advanced economies saw robust growth, with the US economy expected to gain additional growth momentum from the US tax reform.",
        "The euro area and Japanese economies would continue expanding given improvements in domestic demand and exports.",
        "Meanwhile, China’s economy was expected to expand at a slower pace due to the government’s structural economic reforms through excess capacity reduction and a tighter regulation on funding through banks and shadow banks.",
        "Asian economies would gain further traction on account of domestic demand that was partly driven by the public sector.",
        "Meanwhile, exports were expected to expand well given increasing demand for electronic goods, and some countries would further benefit from an increase in commodity prices.",
        "In addition, Asia’s exports would gain in part from the improved US growth outlook following the tax reform.",
        "Nevertheless, the impact from the US safeguard measures on certain products exported from Thailand was expected to be largely limited.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies was increasing gradually thanks to oil and fresh food prices.",
        "In advanced economies, particularly the US, inflation would likely trend up toward target, while in most Asian economies inflation was within the target.",
        "Most trading partner central banks maintained accommodative monetary policy stance, although some central banks in both advanced economies and Asia began raising policy rates given the firmer economic recovery underpinned by domestic demand and the acceleration of inflation toward target.",
        "Against such backdrop, the Committee projected that risks to economic growth of trading partners were largely balanced, where risks surrounding US economic and foreign trade policies as well as geopolitics continued to warrant monitoring going forward.",
        "In addition, the Committee saw the need to monitor other factors that could affect inflation expectations in the US, such as the outlook for fiscal deficits as well as oil prices, as these might influence the pace of the federal funds rate increases.",
        "Global asset prices declined as risk-off sentiments were prevalent among investors in early February.",
        "While overall sentiments in the global financial markets had been sound in the prior period, with sustained capital inflows to emerging markets as well as the expectations of gradual monetary policy normalization by the Federal Reserve (Fed), in February investors expected a faster pace of the federal funds rate increases than previously assessed as reflected in a pickup in the 10-year US treasury yields.",
        "Consequently, investors gradually sold risky assets, resulting in a decline in global asset prices, an appreciation of the US dollar, and - 2 capital outflows from some countries in the region.",
        "With regard to the bond and foreign exchange markets, Thai government bond yields, unlike the US treasury counterparts, fell as demand from both foreign and domestic investors outgrew the supply of government bonds.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht experienced rising volatilities.",
        "In January, the Thai currency appreciated against the US dollar as the latter weakened, with the baht appreciating at a faster pace than many regional currencies partly due to a large current account surplus and accelerated capital inflows to the bond market.",
        "However, the baht weakened against the US dollar in February as the dollar strengthened.",
        "Looking ahead, the baht would likely experience volatile movements mainly due to uncertainties pertaining to monetary and fiscal policies in advanced economies.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as potential impacts on the economy going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that recent capital inflows to Thailand were partly due to improved sentiments of foreign investors regarding Thailand’s economic outlook and sound external positions.",
        "These were reflected in the large current account surplus, low external debt, foreign exchange reserves at a high level, and low volatility of the baht.",
        "In addition, the Committee also noted that Thailand’s large current account surplus partly reflected structural changes in both global and Thai economies.",
        "These included (1) a surplus in the services balance attributed to net tourism receipts following the Chinese government’s policy supporting Chinese outbound travels, (2) a surplus in the trade balance due to a decline in the value of imports on account of a significant fall in oil prices since late 2014, and (3) the low level of domestic investment.",
        "In addition, the large current account surplus was partly due to a rising surplus in the services balance compared with the trade balance surplus.",
        "The current account surplus was expected to sustain for some period.",
        "Consequently, policy coordination from various parties was necessary for capital flows to become more balanced, such as (1) expediting public investment to be undertaken as planned, especially investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that involved imported raw materials and (2) supporting individual and institutional investors with a significant amount of savings to effectively invest abroad without unnecessary regulatory limitations.",
        "These efforts would help in part alleviate pressures on the baht.",
        "The Thai economy gained further traction and saw robust growth, driven by improved growth in the external sectors and a gradual improvement in domestic demand.",
        "Merchandise exports improved both in terms of quantity thanks to a stronger growth of trading partners than previously assessed, and in terms of prices on the back of rising global crude oil prices.",
        "Tourism continued to expand.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, private spending was further driven by improved merchandise exports that increasingly lifted household income as well as government measures that were directly aimed at boosting private spending.",
        "Private consumption continued to expand, particularly on durable goods, driven by non-agricultural households with higher income.",
        "Moreover, consumption would also be supported by public spending thanks to the fiscal 2018 supplementary budget, in particular the social welfare card project (second phase) and the community enterprise development project, which would help increase purchasing power of low-income households going forward.",
        "Private investment continued to grow in line with the improved growth outlook, with additional support from the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) initiative.",
        "The prospect of this initiative became more certain after the approval of the EEC bill by the National Legislative Assembly on 8 February 2018.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important - 3 growth driver given the higher-than-expected budget for fiscal 2019 endorsed by the cabinet with a larger-than-expected share of current expenditure.",
        "This would consequently inject more money into the economy in the short run as current expenditure disbursement was more efficient than investment disbursement.",
        "Nonetheless, public investment slowed down somewhat in the recent period as a result of the postponement of some SOE investment plans, together with the enforcement of the Public Procurement and Supplies Management Act, B.E.",
        "2560, which might cause government and related agencies to take time initially to adjust.",
        "However, public investment was expected to resume growth going forward.",
        "While the Committee viewed that the Thai economy was growing well, with improvement in incomes beginning to be observed among non-agricultural low-income households, the strength of domestic demand going forward was still subject to several factors.",
        "A somewhat gradual improvement in household purchasing power was partly a result of structural changes in the labor market, such as adoption of automation in place of human labor in the production process as well as a decline in agricultural prices which made farming unattractive.",
        "These led to greater migration out of the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to the services sector.",
        "Nevertheless, those workers migrating from manufacturing to services might earn less because of the relatively low productivity and wages in the latter sector.",
        "Moreover, elevated household debt underlined the fact that workers still needed to earmark part of their income for debt repayment.",
        "In solving such structural problems, the Committee viewed that agricultural and labor reform measures would be more effective than monetary policy, and the Committee would continue to closely monitor the continuity of growth in private consumption, especially after the impact of government measures from the supplementary budget for fiscal 2018 dissipated.",
        "Headline inflation dropped slightly in January 2018 owing to a slowdown in energy price increases after having accelerated in the previous period.",
        "Core inflation stabilized at a low level.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to gradually trend up toward target on account of domestic demand recovery and higher oil prices than in the previous year.",
        "Meanwhile, the impact of the minimum wage increases on the overall wage was expected to be limited.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low as domestic demand was not sufficiently strong, labor income grew at a slow pace, and businesses faced limitations in price adjustments due to rising competition.",
        "Moreover, the Committee viewed that structural changes, such as technological development and an expansion of e-commerce, would cause inflation to rise more slowly than in the past.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s inflation expectations appeared to be more stable given recent improvements in inflation outturns.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that low demand-pull inflationary pressures reflected economic growth that was still in the initial stage of expansion and could improve from the current level.",
        "In their views, there remained productive resources that had yet to be fully utilized such as significant underemployment among Bachelor’s degree graduates as well as many available spaces in industrial estates which could accommodate more investment.",
        "Growth in commercial bank loans accelerated toward the end of 2017.",
        "Loans extended to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) increased across a broader range of businesses such as manufacturing, real estate, services, and commerce.",
        "Such increases also broadened across wider geographical areas, which reflected a greater positive spillover of overall economic growth to SMEs.",
        "Meanwhile, loans extended to large corporates were still concentrated in industrial estates and provinces in the eastern region.",
        "Consumer loans expanded in all purposes, particularly auto loans.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the overall non-performing - 4 loan (NPL) ratio remained stable, except for (1) the NPL ratio for business loans that declined thanks to a gradual recovery of SMEs in various businesses consistent with improving economic growth and (2) the NPL ratio for consumer loans which declined because of end-ofyear consumer loan portfolio management.",
        "Nevertheless, issues to be monitored remained, including debt serviceability of certain small businesses, such as retail businesses in commerce, and the increasing NPLs of mortgage loans.",
        "The Committee pointed that this was partly a result of a competition in mortgage loans extension by commercial banks in the past contract, which caused difficulties in debt serviceability for some customers after that period ended.",
        "Moreover, commercial banks were more cautious in extending loans to low-income households in the recent period by targeting at lending to medium-income households with regular income flows who were perceived to have low risks.",
        "This resulted in fewer loans extended to low-income households, and therefore the NPL ratio of this group remained high.",
        "Meanwhile, loans extended by specialized financial institutions (SFIs) and non-banks were projected to rise.",
        "Most of these loans were extended to farmers whose financial positions were fragile and could thus face difficulties in debt repayment.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring.",
        "The ratio of household debt to GDP declined at a slower pace in the third quarter of 2017 relative to the previous period owing to an acceleration in consumer loans.",
        "Household debt serviceability thus remained an issue to be monitored, particularly among low-income households whose debt as a proportion of financial assets was higher than other income groups and was projected to rise.",
        "Meanwhile, the ratio of non-financial corporate debt to GDP declined; nonetheless, debt serviceability of SMEs, especially those affected by economic structural changes and changes in business models, should be monitored.",
        "In any case, financial institutions remained cautious in extending loans to both businesses and households but were more stringent in auto leasing as demand for loans increased.",
        "Regarding asset prices, the overall house price index increased at a slow pace except high-end condominiums.",
        "However, expansion in mortgage loans did not accelerate significantly relative to the past, and demand for high-end condominiums mainly came from high-income households and foreign customers.",
        "Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange of Thailand performance given the positive economic outlook.",
        "The price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) was thus largely unchanged.",
        "Volatilities in Thailand’s financial markets were still at a low level, which reflected risk appetite of investors.",
        "The search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment remained present as reflected in the continued investment in mutual funds during the end of 2017, during which investment in daily fixed income funds accelerated in contrast to investment in foreign investment funds (FIFs) that slowed down due to rising costs of foreign exchange hedging.",
        "Meanwhile, overall growth in asset sizes of saving cooperatives slowed down relative to the previous period.",
        "However, given that deposit growth outpaced loan growth, saving cooperatives consequently increased their investment in long-term assets in search of higher yields.",
        "In addition, the private sector resumed the issuances of unrated bonds in the fourth quarter of 2017, but most of these bonds were shortterm debts issued by large real-estate companies with sound financial positions.",
        "The Committee noted that the pace of deleveraging had slowed down and suggested analyzing household debt by income groups and loan purposes in order to fully understand and consequently formulate appropriate policies.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee viewed that - 5 land prices in the central business district were relatively high, which prompted real-estate companies to develop high-end condominiums.",
        "The success of those projects would thus depend on understanding the property market and the ability to meet the needs of highincome and foreign customers.",
        "However, tightening global financial conditions might dampen demand from foreign customers.",
        "In addition, some Committee members noted that, while mixed-use development projects became increasingly popular, there remained significant demand for office spaces relative to demand for spaces for commercial use.",
        "Overall, the Committee saw the need to monitor developments in the property market, especially projects with weak financial positions that might rely on funding through unrated bonds.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would gain further traction and would see robust growth, driven by external sectors as well as the gradual improvement in domestic demand.",
        "Headline inflation was projected to rise at a gradual pace.",
        "Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward.",
        "The Committee considered the benefits and costs of policy alternatives and viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "(1) The overall Thai economy gained further traction, with domestic demand improving but not sufficiently strong.",
        "Economic growth was mainly driven by external demand from both merchandise exports and tourism and began to broaden out to wider economic sectors.",
        "However, private consumption still gradually expanded as agricultural prices declined, household debts remained high, and the labor market had yet to fully recover.",
        "As a result, purchasing power of low-income households was not sufficiently strong.",
        "Private consumption would thus have to be monitored going forward, particularly after the effects of this year’s government measures dissipated.",
        "Moreover, with the saving-investment gap, investment still had the potential to expand further.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that Thailand’s economic expansion was still at the initial stage and facing structural changes in various aspects.",
        "Overall, the Committee viewed that an accommodative monetary policy stance was still necessary for some period to foster stronger domestic demand going forward.",
        "(2) Headline inflation gradually trended up toward target mainly on the back of supply-side factor such as an increase in oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the effect of the minimum wage increases on the overall wage was largely limited.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low.",
        "The Committee viewed that supply-side and structural factors at present might result in a lower impact of demand-pull pressures on inflation—for instance, rising business competition given e-commerce resulted in difficulties in price adjustments.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor inflation developments going forward.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall.",
        "There remained pockets of risks, though largely benign, that warranted monitoring as they might result in the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward.",
        "Such risks included (1) underpricing of risks that stemmed from the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate - 6 environment, (2) debt serviceability of low-income households and SMEs that were largely affected by structural economic changes and changes in business models, (3) new openings of high-end condominiums and mixed-use development projects, and (4) developments in saving cooperatives under the enhanced supervisory framework.",
        "In this light, the Committee assessed policy trade-offs and unanimously voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "The Committee concurred on the need to maintain accommodative monetary policy stance and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to support the continuation of economic growth while preserving",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies continued to gain further traction since the previous meeting.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to expand mainly on the back of private consumption.",
        "Although consumption was somewhat dampened by unusually cold weather, robust labor markets and strong consumer confidence were key supporting factors for growth in advanced economies.",
        "However, confidence in the euro area temporarily declined due to political developments in Italy and Spain.",
        "Meanwhile, the US continued to be driven by fiscal stimulus.",
        "China and Asian economies continued to grow driven by exports and consumption thanks to strong global demand and increased commodity prices.",
        "Nevertheless, the rise in oil prices had a small impact on consumption given government measures to mitigate the adverse impact in many countries.",
        "Headline inflation in trading partner economies accelerated in line with oil prices, while inflation expectations and core inflation were largely unchanged.",
        "Nonetheless, global inflation remained subdued, partly as a result of structural factors such as lower labor productivity growth and expansion of e-commerce.",
        "With regard to monetary policy in trading partners, the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the federal funds rate in June 2018 and was expected to raise the policy rate a total of four times this year instead of three, following a positive outlook of the US economy and inflation.",
        "On the contrary, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its monetary policy accommodation, but announced its intention to end the bond purchases as well as outlined its policy normalization path in the period ahead.",
        "However, some central banks in the region such as Indonesia and the Philippines raised the policy rate in order to curb volatilities in the financial markets.",
        "The Committee assessed that downside risks to economic growth of trading partners increased given US trade protectionism measures and retaliatory measures by US trading partners, which were increasingly intensified and unlikely to be resolved in the near future.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to closely monitor developments of trade policies and negotiations as they could have stronger impacts than anticipated on the expansion of trading partner economies and global trade volume in 2019.",
        "Global financial markets experienced greater volatilities given monetary policy divergence in advanced economies.",
        "The US dollar appreciated against almost all currencies as the Fed was expected to raise the federal funds rate sooner than market expectations.",
        "On the other hand, the ECB would likely keep its policy rate unchanged at least until the summer of next year, which would be longer than market expectations.",
        "In addition, latest euro area economic - 2 data came out softer than anticipated.",
        "Meanwhile, the market became increasingly concerned about trade protectionism.",
        "These developments prompted investors to continually reduce their holdings of risky assets including investments in emerging market economies, particularly countries with vulnerable economic fundamentals such as Argentina and Turkey.",
        "The baht depreciated against the US dollar in light of the dollar’s strength against most currencies.",
        "The baht also weakened against trading partner currencies, partly because some regional currencies had depreciated in the prior period.",
        "In addition, some central banks already began to gradually raise the policy rate, which helped slow down the pace of depreciation to some extent.",
        "Overall Thai government bond yields picked up slightly since the previous meeting.",
        "Short- and medium-term Thai government bond yields rose due to (1) recent economic and inflation outturns which were better than expected and (2) an Foreign investors continued to sell off emerging market short-term bonds.",
        "Long-term Thai government bond yields fell in line with US government bond yields and due to a higher demand from foreign investors following improved confidence about the Thai economy.",
        "Looking ahead, the baht would likely experience volatile movements due to (1) uncertainties pertaining to the conduct of monetary, fiscal, and trade policies in advanced economies together with retaliatory measures, (2) geopolitical risks, (3) increased emerging market risks as perceived by investors, and (4) the outlook of oil prices.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor these developments and their potential impacts on exchange rates and the economy going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that the impact from rising bond yields in recent periods on financing costs of the private sector through the bond market was still limited.",
        "In addition, overall corporate financing through financial institutions and the bond market did not slow down.",
        "However, at this current juncture where global interest rates were on an upward cycle, global financial conditions would tighten and pose risks to domestic financial conditions.",
        "The Committee would thus closely monitor such development and its impact on corporate financing.",
        "Moreover, some Committee members viewed that, although Thailand’s sound external stability contributed to limited risks of capital outflows induced by interest rate differentials between Thailand and foreign countries, it was deemed necessary to closely monitor capital flows by both Thai and foreign investors.",
        "The Thai economy continued to gain further traction driven by improvements in both domestic and external demand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports improved from the previous assessment mainly on the back of rising global crude oil prices, while export volume would expand at a slightly better pace than previously estimated.",
        "However, there were still risks from the impact of US trade protectionism measures, particularly from US tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.",
        "Meanwhile, the value of imports increased in line with prices of crude oil and other industrial products, as well as improvements in export volume and domestic demand.",
        "Exports of services continued to grow in line with the number of tourists and increased utilization of regional airports.",
        "Moreover, domestic demand gained additional momentum.",
        "In particular, private consumption continued to expand at a faster rate than previously assessed especially on account of spending by medium- and high-income households.",
        "However, elevated household debt and the economic expansion that had yet to fully extend to household income and employment in a broad-based manner held down - 3 household consumption to some extent.",
        "Furthermore, private investment would continue expanding in construction as well as machinery and equipment.",
        "Private investment would also gain additional support from public investment projects, whose prospects became more certain following developments with regard to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) initiative and the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme.",
        "In the Committee’s view, if investment in the EEC was to progress as planned, private-sector investment would then achieve a higher growth rate.",
        "Public expenditure remained a driver of economic growth, although public consumption growth was lower than the previous assessment.",
        "This was due to the change in government budget structure for fiscal year 2019, with a larger share of capital budget compared with the previous announcement.",
        "Meanwhile, some of public investment projects intended for 2018 were postponed, especially investment projects of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that faced operational difficulties resulting in delayed disbursement such as the second phase of the Suvarnabhumi Airport Development Project (1[st] contract) and the Bang Pakong Power Plant Project.",
        "With regard to public investment in 2019, it was expected to rise given a larger share of capital budget and the double track railway project (Denchai– Chiang Khong), which became certain.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue expanding and achieve a higher growth than the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee therefore revised up the growth forecast for 2018 to 4.4 percent, up from 4.1 percent.",
        "The revision was on account of merchandise exports and tourism, which improved in line with global economic expansion, and increased domestic demand momentum.",
        "In 2019, the economy would record a 4.2 percent growth, up from 4.1 percent.",
        "The slightly softer growth next year compared with this year was in line with global growth moderation.",
        "Nevertheless, there were still possibilities that the Thai economy would exhibit a higher growth than the baseline projection.",
        "These were attributable to growth of trading partners which might be stronger than previously expected, given a continued improvement in the US economy, additional economic measures from the Chinese government that could soften China’s economic slowdown, and public expenditure on both investment in infrastructure projects and measures to support private sector spending that might be higher than anticipated.",
        "However, risks to the growth forecast tilted more toward the downside with possibilities that growth outturns could be lower than the baseline projection mainly due to external factors.",
        "These included (1) US trade protectionism measures and possible retaliatory measures by US trading partners, as well as stronger competition from trade diversion, which might have a larger-than-anticipated impact on Thai exports and rising competition in domestic markets, and (2) a lower-thanexpected growth of Thailand’s trading partners if geopolitical conflicts were to occur.",
        "There were also some downside risks from domestic factors including (1) a lower-than-expected consumption as domestic purchasing power had yet to increase broadly, and (2) the impact from the enforcement of the Public Procurement and Supplies Management Act, B.E.",
        "2560 which might lead to longer-than-expected delays in budget disbursement of government agencies.",
        "The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding Thailand’s growth outlook in the period ahead and on various factors that might result in different growth outturns from the previous forecast.",
        "Apart from external risks which could potentially affect Thai exports, the Committee viewed that public investment projects and PPP projects would have a significant impact on Thailand’s economic growth.",
        "The success of such investments would thus be highly - 4 important going forward.",
        "Furthermore, some Committee members noted that benefits from the improvement in economic expansion were not yet broad-based.",
        "This was partly a result of structural changes in the labor market such as adoption of automation in place of labor in production processes, changes in demand for labor skills, and low global agricultural prices that were unlikely to improve.",
        "Thus, private consumption in the period ahead might not grow at a high rate as in the past.",
        "Headline inflation rose at a faster pace than previously forecasted toward target in April and May 2018 mainly on the back of acceleration in domestic oil prices in line with global prices, while fresh food prices increased slower than previously anticipated.",
        "Core inflation increased slightly mainly due to supply-side pressures—in particular, a gradual rise in fresh food and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low but would likely improve, as reflected in a slight increase in prices of some products in the core inflation basket such as personal care products.",
        "Meanwhile, overall public’s inflation expectations remained largely stable.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee expected headline inflation to rise at a slightly faster pace than previously assessed owing to a rise in oil prices and some improvement in demand-pull pressures.",
        "The Committee thus revised up the headline inflation forecast for 2018 to 1.1 percent, up from 1.0 percent, and projected headline inflation for 2019 to be 1.2 percent.",
        "Core inflation for 2018 was projected to remain close to the previous assessment at 0.7 percent, while core inflation would rise to 0.9 percent in 2019, up from 0.8 percent.",
        "This was owing to a slight increase in demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, risks to the inflation forecast tilted to the downside consistent with risks to the growth forecast.",
        "Commercial bank loans continued to expand in almost all loan purposes, especially loans extended to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with relatively large credit lines, and continued to grow across almost all types of businesses.",
        "SME loans with smaller credit lines, however, increased only moderately.",
        "Meanwhile, consumer loans expanded in all loan purposes, particularly auto loans.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the overall non-performing loan (NPL) ratio edged up slightly, especially NPLs of SMEs with small credit lines.",
        "However, NPLs of overall consumer loans remained stable, except NPLs of mortgage loans which continued to increase.",
        "The Committee viewed that these developments reflected a stronger economic expansion.",
        "However, debt serviceability of small SMEs must still be monitored, given relatively high default rates and a relatively large number of debtors in the commercial bank system.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction and would grow at a higher rate than previously projected, with additional momentum from both domestic and external demand.",
        "Headline inflation would rise at a slightly higher pace than the previous assessment, while core inflation was projected to rise slowly.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "- 5 (1) The Thai economy overall continued to gain further traction, driven by merchandise exports and tourism which continued to improve in tandem with global growth, and by a stronger momentum from domestic demand, especially from private consumption.",
        "However, household debt and structural changes, such as declining working-age population in the labor market and an adoption of automation in place of labor in production processes, resulted in the economic expansion that had yet to benefit overall household income and employment.",
        "In the Committee’s view, these issues should be addressed through various structural reform policies.",
        "Private investment was expected to continue expanding with additional support from public investment projects whose prospects became more certain, although their progress in the period ahead must be monitored.",
        "Meanwhile, public expenditure remained a driver of growth, although there were risks of more-than-expected delay in disbursement.",
        "The Committee would thus continue to monitor external risks, especially risks related to US foreign trade policies and retaliatory measures by US trading partners as well as geopolitical risks.",
        "Moreover, some Committee members saw the need to monitor sectoral growth in order to assess sustainability of aggregate expansion.",
        "The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy remained necessary to help support the continuation of (2) Headline inflation was projected to gradually trend up at a slightly faster pace than previously assessed toward target mainly on the back of an acceleration in oil prices.",
        "Core inflation was projected to edge up slightly given gradual build-up in demand-pull inflationary pressures, while the public’s inflation expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "Therefore, the Committee viewed that accommodative monetary policy should facilitate headline inflation to remain within target in a sustainable manner.",
        "However, the Committee viewed that uncertainties regarding highly volatile fresh food prices remained an important factor.",
        "In addition, structural changes, such as expansion of e-commerce and rising price competition that led to changes in inflation dynamics, might contribute to a more persistent inflation than in the past, despite the continued improvement in an economic growth.",
        "Therefore, the Committee saw the need to study the impact of such factors on inflation dynamics in further details, as this could have significant implications on the future setting of the inflation target.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained pockets of risks that might result in the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system.",
        "Such risks included (1) the search-for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks, (2) a continued increase in assets and deposits of saving cooperatives despite slowing down somewhat compared with the previous period due to more stringent regulations, (3) debt serviceability of households and SMEs, and (4) the property market where businesses continued to increase their investment and financial institutions engaged in competition by extending mortgage loans with higher credit risks.",
        "The Committee viewed that the policy interest rate was a preventive tool against these risks from further developing and affecting broad financial stability, and that it should be used in conjunction with macroprudential measures to preserve financial stability.",
        "The Committee viewed that the current monetary policy accommodation helped in part support economic growth and sustain headline inflation within target.",
        "Most Committee members voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.",
        "However, one Committee member voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 percent with the view that the economic recovery was sufficiently robust and inflation was expected - 6 to remain within target throughout the projection period.",
        "Moreover, the member viewed that the prolonged monetary accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes to financial conditions and thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to start building policy space.",
        "In this light, the Committee voted 5 to 1 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.",
        "50 percent at this meeting and viewed that accommodative monetary policy remained an important factor to sustain domestic demand growth and facilitate a gradual rise in headline inflation toward target in a sustainable manner.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee discussed conditions and appropriate timing to begin normalizing monetary policy in the future.",
        "The Committee viewed that, should economic expansion continue and inflation move more firmly within target, the need for currently extra accommodative monetary policy would start to be reduced, and that the need for a policy rate increase in order to build policy space in the",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies continued to gain further traction in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Advanced economies continued to expand mainly on the back of private consumption and improved economic fundamentals, especially the US economy which was growing above potential.",
        "However, consumption in the euro area recovered somewhat slower than expected.",
        "China and Asian economies continued to grow at a slower pace as previously assessed, driven by private consumption and exports.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies increased in line with the previous assessment mainly on the back of rising energy prices.",
        "Inflation in the US rose as the economy grew above potential, while inflation in the Asian countries gradually increased as the economy approached potential.",
        "With regard to monetary policy of trading partners, the Federal Reserve (Fed) was expected to raise the policy rate two more times by the end of 2018, while the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) were expected to maintain their monetary policy accommodation for some time.",
        "Some central banks in the region such as Indonesia and the Philippines raised the policy rate in order to safeguard external stability and contain inflation.",
        "The Committee assessed that risks to trading partners’ growth tilted more toward the downside due mainly to uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism measures and retaliatory measures by US trading partners as the situation recently intensified.",
        "Although such risks had yet to impact real sector activities including international trades, private investment, and inflation, the Committee deemed it necessary to monitor further developments regarding US trade protectionism including how businesses would adapt to the situation.",
        "Meanwhile, future monetary policy actions of various central banks could lead to further tightening of global financial conditions and thus must also be monitored given its implications for economic growth as well as confidence among domestic and foreign investors.",
        "Over the recent period, concerns over US trade protectionism had limited impact on the global financial markets but led to a sharp depreciation of Asian currencies, especially the Chinese yuan and currencies of countries highly connected with China.",
        "In the early stage, rising concerns over trade protectionism prompted investors to be more cautious in investing in risky assets as reflected in a rapid decline in global stock market indices at the end of June, before rebounding thereafter as capital outflows from regional bond and equity markets slowed down.",
        "On exchange rates, the US dollar appreciated against other currencies due to monetary policy normalization by the Fed and possible inflation pickup in the US from higher import tariffs as a result of US trade protectionism measures.",
        "This could result in a faster‐ than‐expected pace of rate hikes in the US.",
        "Meanwhile, the appreciation of the US dollar also led to the depreciation of Asian currencies.",
        "The baht depreciated against the US dollar and underwent volatile movements in line with other regional currencies due to concerns over trade protectionism and demand for US dollar by some Thai firms for overseas investment in the recent period.",
        "Short‐term Thai government bond yields rose due to increased government bond issuance as well as declining demand for short‐term government bonds by foreign investors.",
        "Nevertheless, such increase in short‐term government bond yields was limited because higher yields also caused Thai investors to start switching from their investment in foreign investment funds (FIF) to short‐term Thai government bonds.",
        "Meanwhile, long‐term Thai government bond yields fell due to increased concerns over US trade protectionism and higher demand by foreign investors for some series of government bonds due to adjustment in the proportion of investment in Thai government bonds following changes in benchmark bonds included in the global bond index.",
        "The Committee viewed that the global financial markets remain highly uncertain in the period ahead due to factors such as (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies and (2) trade protectionism that could further intensify and affect the global economy as well as capital flows, which would then put pressure on asset prices and exchange rates particularly in emerging markets with vulnerable economic fundamentals and high interconnectedness with China and Europe.",
        "The Committee thus viewed it necessary to monitor such situations and their implications for exchange rates and bond yields, as well The Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by both external and domestic demand.",
        "Following a temporary slowdown in the first quarter of 2018, the value of merchandise exports later registered higher growth in terms of both quantities and prices as a result of improved external demand and rising crude oil prices, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the impacts of US trade protectionism measures were so far limited to some products such as washing machines and solar cells, which constituted a small share of total exports value.",
        "Going forward, additional relocation of production base to Thailand, for some industries such as hard disk drives, would continue to lend further support to merchandise exports.",
        "Private consumption continued to expand in almost all categories mainly on the back of spending by middle‐ to high‐income households as well as improving consumer confidence.",
        "Factors underpinning the private consumption outlook also showed gradual improvements overall as reflected by (1) improved and more broad‐based employment in manufacturing, services, and agricultural sectors; (2) farm income which continued to see gradual improvements thanks to higher agricultural output; and (3) the implementation of additional government stimulus policies.",
        "Private investment was projected to continue expanding in line with improving business sentiment, especially investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "This was reflected in imports of capital goods by export‐ and energy‐related businesses.",
        "The outlook for private investment was further supported by greater certainty regarding the prospects of public investment projects with further progress on projects under the Eastern Economic Corridor monitored going forward.",
        "Public expenditure remained a driver of growth.",
        "Government consumption growth was largely stable, while public investment was expected to grow at a slower pace due to problems related to budget disbursement capabilities as well as potential delays in some state‐owned enterprise (SOE) investment projects.",
        "In addition, exports of services was projected to continue growing but at a slower pace than previously assessed mainly due to the Phuket tour boat sinking incident.",
        "The incident might affect tourist arrivals, especially Chinese tourists, and could also lead to lower income for tourism‐related businesses, as some businesses adapted to the situation by offering discounts to bolster sales.",
        "In order to assess the impact from the incident in terms of magnitude and duration, it was deemed necessary to monitor further developments and how affected businesses would adapt to the situation.",
        "Headline inflation in June and July 2018 increased albeit at a slightly lower rate than previously assessed on account of a larger‐than‐expected decline in fresh food prices given higher output, especially prices of vegetable, fruits, and meat.",
        "Meanwhile, energy prices continued to rise in tandem with global oil prices.",
        "Core inflation edged up slightly higher than previously assessed mainly on the back of increases in prices of prepared food and house rent, while prices of other items remained largely stable.",
        "Looking ahead, headline inflation was projected to slowly rise as demand pressure gradually builds up and as oil prices increase.",
        "The annual average headline inflation was expected to be within target, although downside risks remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate sharply depending on weather conditions and agricultural output.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation might also be more persistent than in the past even though the economy was growing at full potential.",
        "This could be attributed to structural factors that affected pricing power such as the expansion of e‐commerce, heightened price competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which reduced costs of production.",
        "In this light, the Committee saw the need to further study the impact of these structural changes on prices, including how technological development affected input costs and productivity, due to its implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "Nevertheless, overall public’s inflation The Committee engaged in extensive discussion regarding Thailand’s growth outlook especially on momentum of domestic demand which was subject to challenges arising from structural changes that affected wage setting; low inflation; and elevated household debt.",
        "The Committee assessed that the pass‐through of benefits from economic growth to the labor market became more evident as reflected in the more broad‐based increase in non‐ agricultural hiring, while agricultural employment remained high.",
        "Nevertheless, the average wage had yet to clearly increase.",
        "The average wage growth in Thailand had remained low for many years especially when compared with other regional countries.",
        "This could partly be explained by structural factors in the Thai labor market such as (1) high degree of labor mobility, which allowed labor shortages in one sector to be alleviated by labor from another sector as well as by migrant workers, that resulted in limited upward pressure on wages; (2) greater adoption of automation in place of labor in the production process; and (3) low inflation which limited wage increases especially for low‐income workers.",
        "Meanwhile, elevated household debt remained a drag on purchasing power.",
        "As such, the Committee deemed it necessary to closely monitor developments on these fronts given that they might affect household purchasing power in the period ahead.",
        "Commercial bank loans continued to expand in almost all loan purposes, especially loans extended to small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) with relatively large credit lines and consumer loans.",
        "Loans extended to businesses with smaller credit lines increased in some areas, while consumer loans expanded in all loan purposes, especially auto loans which continued to pick up as prior debt burden from the first‐car scheme gradually receded.",
        "With regard to credit quality, the non‐performing loan (NPL) ratio was stable.",
        "However, the NPL ratio of SMEs remained high.",
        "Meanwhile the NPL ratio of consumer loans was largely unchanged, except for mortgage loans which increased.",
        "The Committee viewed that these developments reflected continued improvements in economic growth.",
        "The Committee also deemed it necessary to closely monitor growth in loans extended to small businesses and households as well as the credit quality of SME loans with small credit lines and mortgage loans.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability going forward.",
        "Regarding leverage, the seasonally adjusted household debt‐to‐GDP ratio remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2018, while non‐financial corporate debt‐to‐GDP ratio continued to decline.",
        "In addition, it appeared that businesses switched their funding from debt issuance more toward commercial bank loans.",
        "Meanwhile, there remained the need to monitor the accumulation of new household borrowing which might delay the deleveraging process, and also debt serviceability of SMEs affected by structural changes.",
        "With regard to asset prices, volatility of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index remained high but decreased somewhat as investor confidence improved.",
        "In addition, further tightening of financial conditions in the period ahead could lead to higher funding costs through bond issuance for businesses and could affect their ability to rollover debt.",
        "For the real estate sector, the house price index continued to rise, although it did not pick up significantly.",
        "Meanwhile, commercial banks competed in extending mortgage loans with higher credit risks.",
        "This was reflected in a rising share of new mortgage loans with the loan‐to‐value (LTV) ratio exceeding 90 percent as well as the increasing loan‐to‐income higher NPL ratio.",
        "The overall situation regarding the oversupply of new condominiums improved somewhat as the amount of time required for businesses to unload the stock of condominiums declined partly due to developers’ deferred opening of new projects.",
        "Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider additional indicators to monitor developers’ adjustment such as ownership transfers and oversupply in certain areas in order to assess the situation in the property market.",
        "The Committee thus deemed it necessary to closely monitor competition in the mortgage loan market as well as the oversupply of condominiums in certain areas and the existing stock of old condominiums.",
        "The search‐for‐yield behavior remained present in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "This was evident in the persistently high asset growth among saving cooperatives whereby some large saving cooperatives became increasingly reliant on borrowing, in tandem with accelerated lending growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the search for yield in other areas was not of concern.",
        "Mutual funds continued to grow with increased investment in fixed‐income funds, whereas investment in foreign investment funds (FIF) slowed down.",
        "Some Committee members also discussed the need for macroprudential measures to address and prevent risks that could not self‐correct through market mechanism such as growing assets of saving cooperatives, competition in the mortgage loan market, and debt serviceability of SMEs and households.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by merchandise exports and tourism in tandem with global economic growth, and by stronger momentum from domestic demand.",
        "The outlook for headline inflation was largely unchanged from the previous assessment with the annual average expected to be within target.",
        "However, downside risks remained from sharp fluctuations in fresh food prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was expected to edge up slightly higher as demand pressure would gradually build up.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conducive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall.",
        "The Committee viewed that in the context where (1) the economy is growing at potential and (2) inflation became less responsive to economic growth due partly to structural factors, with the annual average inflation expected to be within target, it would be important to monitor the build‐up of vulnerabilities in the financial system, which could be reflected in underpricing of risks and competition in the mortgage loan market.",
        "In their policy deliberation, the Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "Their conclusions were as follows.",
        "(1) The Thai economy overall continued to gain further traction.",
        "Merchandise exports were expected to achieve higher growth than previously assessed partly due to the relocation of production base to Thailand for some industries.",
        "Private consumption was projected to continue expanding but overall purchasing power was still recovering at a gradual pace due to elevated household debt.",
        "Private investment continued to expand with additional support from greater certainty regarding the prospects of public investment projects, although their progress must still be monitored going forward.",
        "The Committee viewed that, going forward, potential impacts of both external and domestic risks on Thailand’s economic growth and capital flow volatility continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "Such risks included (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies; (2) US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures from its trading partners, which would affect global trade and Thai exports; and (3) lower‐than‐expected tourism growth as a result of the Phuket tour boat sinking incident.",
        "In this light, some Committee members viewed that current growth momentum still warranted monitoring, and thus the current level of monetary policy accommodation would support a more robust growth in domestic demand.",
        "(2) The outlook for headline inflation was largely unchanged from the previous assessment, but downside risks remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate sharply depending on weather conditions and agricultural output.",
        "Core inflation was projected to edge up slightly as demand‐pull inflationary pressure would gradually build up.",
        "The public’s inflation expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "In addition, structural changes such as the expansion of e‐commerce, heightened price competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which reduced costs of production might result in more persistent inflation than in the past even though the economy was growing at full potential.",
        "In this regard, the Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be (3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there were some pockets of risk areas that had yet to show signs of improvements and might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability going forward, especially as economic growth strengthened.",
        "Such risks included those pertaining to (1) the property market where businesses continued to raise funds despite the oversupply of condominiums in certain areas, while financial institutions engaged in competition by extending mortgage loans with increased credit risks; (2) debt accumulation among households in which the debt‐to‐income ratio had yet to indicate clear signs of deleveraging, while the prolonged low interest rate environment might encourage further debt accumulation thus impeding the deleveraging process.",
        "Some Committee members viewed that persistently high household debts and impaired debt serviceability of SMEs might have an impact on economic growth over the long run; (3) the search‐for‐yield behavior under the prolonged low interest rate environment which could lead to the underpricing of risks, especially among saving cooperatives whose assets continued to grow at a high rate.",
        "In addition, some large saving cooperatives had become increasingly reliant on borrowing in tandem with accelerated lending growth.",
        "In the context of prolonged low interest rate and varying degrees in financial regulations, the Committee viewed that macroprudential measures alone would not be sufficient in preventing potential risks in the financial system.",
        "Thus, monetary policy must be conducted with caution as to not contribute to further build‐ Against this backdrop, the Committee viewed that the current monetary policy accommodation played a part in supporting economic growth, especially in sustaining domestic demand, and allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "The Committee thus voted 6 to 1 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 1.50 percent.",
        "One member voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 percent with a view that the economic recovery was sufficiently robust and that the prolonged monetary accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes to financial conditions.",
        "The member thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to curb financial stability risks that could affect the sustainability of economic growth over the longer term and to start building policy space.",
        "In addition the Committee discussed conditions and appropriate timing to begin normalizing monetary policy in the future.",
        "The Committee viewed that, should economic expansion continue and inflation move more firmly within target, the need for currently extra accommodative monetary policy would start to be reduced, and that the need for a policy rate increase in order to build policy space in the future would be increasing.",
        "The Committee would continue to closely monitor the outlook of economic growth and inflation, as well as risks especially on the external front.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies continued to expand but would grow at a slower pace going forward.",
        "This was attributable to global trade volume that would likely be affected by trade protectionism and tightening financial conditions in several economies.",
        "Advanced economies were expected to continue expanding, particularly the US economy which was supported by a robust labor market, income tax cuts, and strong consumer confidence.",
        "Euro area and Japan economies were supported by accommodative financial conditions and strong labor markets, although growth momentum was slower by political issues in the euro area and natural disasters in Japan during the second quarter as well as impacts from trade protectionism.",
        "China and Asian economies would continue expanding at a slightly slower pace due in part to trade protectionism and tightening financial conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, the Chinese government implemented measures, such as infrastructure investment as well as tax reduction, to alleviate burden of household and business sectors in order to support growth.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian economies were driven by domestic demand and exports.",
        "Inflation in trading partner economies increased mainly on the back of rising energy prices, while inflation expectations were largely unchanged.",
        "With regard to monetary policy of trading partners, the Federal Reserve (Fed) continued with its tightening cycle as previously assessed, while the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) were expected to keep their accommodative monetary policy stance for some time.",
        "The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased the policy rate to stabilize inflation, while Bank Indonesia raised the rate to curb financial market volatilities.",
        "The Committee assessed that risks to trading partners’ growth were largely unchanged and would remain tilted to the downside due mainly to uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures by US trading partners that could be intensified, as well as geopolitical risks that could cause volatilities in financial and commodity markets, especially oil prices.",
        "In this regard, the Committee saw the need to monitor developments regarding US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures by major trading partners, especially impacts of trade diversion on the manufacturing sector and the labor market in Thailand.",
        "Concerns over US trade protectionism and vulnerable economic fundamentals of some emerging markets posed downward pressures on their asset prices and exchange rates, with the impacts differing depending on economic fundamentals.",
        "Nevertheless, several emerging market central banks started implementing policies to support exchange rate - 2 stability and raising policy interest rates.",
        "Meanwhile, foreign investors reallocated investments from vulnerable emerging markets to economies with relatively stronger external stability that included Thailand.",
        "This resulted in capital inflows to the Thai bond market toward the end of August.",
        "However, overall Thai government bond yields rose due partly to domestic factors such as the second quarter growth outturn which was higher than market expectations.",
        "On exchange rates, Asian currencies, particularly the South Korean won and the New Taiwan dollar, weakened relatively less than those of vulnerable emerging market economies thanks to relatively sound external stability.",
        "Meanwhile, the Thai baht appreciated against regional currencies.",
        "The Committee viewed that the global financial markets remained highly uncertain in the period ahead due to factors such as (1) directions of monetary policy in advanced economies, economic vulnerability in emerging markets that could affect the global economy and capital flows and put pressure on asset prices as well as exchange rates.",
        "Thus, the Committee would continue to closely monitor these developments going forward.",
        "The Thai economy continued to expand driven by both domestic and external demand.",
        "The value of merchandise exports was projected to expand at a slower pace in line with trading partners’ growth and global trade prospects.",
        "In addition, the impacts of trade protectionism measures by the US and China were expected to be more pronounced next year.",
        "Nevertheless, relocation of production base to Thailand for some industries such as hard disk drives could partly lend support to and alleviate trade protectionism impacts on merchandise exports.",
        "Exports of services continued to expand on the back of a higher number of foreign tourists as well as a lower-than-expected adverse impact of the Phuket tour boat sinking incident.",
        "The number of Chinese tourists already started to recover in various areas; meanwhile, some tourists decided to postpone their travel plans to 2019 instead of cancelling them.",
        "In addition, the openings of new airline routes as well as capacity management by both airlines and airports would likely enhance tourism carrying capacity.",
        "The value of imports was projected to grow at a slower pace in tandem with exports but would be supported by improvements in private consumption.",
        "Growth momentum of domestic demand increased, particularly private consumption that continued to expand greater than previously assessed.",
        "This was attributable to continuous improvements in incomes and consumer confidence— particularly increases in earnings of low-income non-agricultural households in almost all sectors as well as increases in incomes of agricultural households thanks to increased supply of farm output—together with supports from government policies such as the first and second phases of the social welfare card scheme, the community enterprise development project, and the agricultural reform project.",
        "However, purchasing power improved only gradually due to elevated household debt and structural changes in the labor market such as by labor from another sector and (2) greater adoption of automation in place of labor in the production processes.",
        "These contributed to limited upward wage pressures.",
        "Private investment was expected to continue expanding in line with private consumption and capital outlays arising from production relocation to Thailand of some export-oriented industries.",
        "Moreover, growth prospects of private investment would be supported by continuous progresses in public infrastructure investment, the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), and the - 3 Public-Private Partnership schemes.",
        "Regarding public expenditure, government consumption expenditure, particularly compensation of civil servants, was projected to increase at a slower pace given policy to replace vacant job positions with contract workers.",
        "Meanwhile, public investment continued to expand, despite construction problems in some central government projects and delays in some state-owned enterprise projects owing to operational difficulties including project revisions, funding reviews, and bidding process delays.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to achieve the same growth rates as in the previous assessment at 4.4 percent and 4.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively.",
        "The growth projection was mainly on the back of further improvements in private expenditure, both consumption and investment, as well as the faster-than-expected recovery after the Phuket boat incident, with the overall tourism growth momentum remaining intact.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports were projected to grow in 2018 at a higher rate than expected but growth would be slightly lower in 2019 due to trade protectionism.",
        "Public expenditure would expand at a lower rate than expected this year, partly because some investment projects were postponed to 2019.",
        "Risks to the growth forecast remained tilted to the downside albeit to a lesser extent compared with the previous projection.",
        "This resulted from a higher likelihood that the economy would exhibit a stronger growth than the baseline projection, particularly attributable to domestic demand which could expand more than projected, given possible further announcement of infrastructure investments and government measures to support private expenditure.",
        "Moreover, there were possibilities that trading partners’ growth could be stronger than expected.",
        "The US economy would be supported by tax reform, while the Chinese economic slowdown could be less than expected.",
        "However, there remained possibilities that growth of the Thai economy would be lower than the baseline projection due mainly to external factors.",
        "Although impacts of the 200 billion dollar worth of tariff that the US imposed on China’s exports were partially included in the baseline projection, there remained uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures that could be further announced.",
        "Additional downside risks included lower-than-expected growth of Thailand’s trading partners that could arise if geopolitical conflicts and economic problems in emerging markets were to occur.",
        "In addition, there remained downside risks pertaining to domestic factors such as lower-than-expected private consumption as domestic purchasing power improved gradually.",
        "The Committee assessed economic expansion to have become more broad-based.",
        "Private consumption and investment continued to improve supported by non-agricultural employment across every major sector, with agricultural employment remaining strong, and by the gradual improvement in earnings of low-income non-agricultural households.",
        "This would lend support to the Thai economy amid uncertainties pertaining to US trade protectionism that could be further announced as well as possible retaliatory measures from major trading partners.",
        "In this light, some Committee members noted that improvements in private consumption were partly supported by government measures, which were temporary, while elevated household debt as well as structural factors in the labor market remained a drag on consumption growth.",
        "As such, some Committee members deemed it necessary to monitor developments of purchasing power in the period ahead.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee viewed that efficiency in budget disbursement and success of public investment projects as - 4 well as the Public-Private Partnership investment projects would be key factors to the economic growth going forward.",
        "Headline inflation rose in August 2018 on account of fresh food prices falling only slightly, given damages to agricultural supply caused by heavy rainfall and given a less severe meat oversupply problem.",
        "Core inflation lingered at a low rate on account of prepared food prices, which were in turn affected by a decline in fresh food prices.",
        "Demand-pull inflationary pressures remained gradually increasing.",
        "Overall public’s inflation expectations remained largely stable.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that headline inflation would increase in line with the previous assessment, and thus maintained the projection of headline inflation for 2018 at 1.1 percent as the decline in fresh food prices was expected to be compensated by higher energy prices.",
        "However, headline inflation forecast for 2019 was revised down from This was partly attributable to technological development that induced higher productivity with lowering costs.",
        "Core inflation was expected to rise in line with the previous assessment, with the core inflation projection for 2018 maintained at 0.7 percent.",
        "However, the core inflation projection for 2019 was slightly revised down from 0.9 percent to 0.8 percent due mainly to prepared food prices.",
        "In addition, core inflation could be more persistent than in the past even though the economy was growing at full potential.",
        "This could be attributed to structural factors such as the expansion of e-commerce and heightened price competition.",
        "Risks to the inflation forecast tilted to the downside consistent with risks to the growth forecast and on the back of fresh food prices that could be lower than expected.",
        "The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain traction, with domestic demand and exports gaining further momentum.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation was expected to rise slowly in line with the previous assessment.",
        "However, downside risks still came from volatile fresh food and oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to edge up at a slightly, albeit at a slower pace than previously assessed, mainly on the back of the gradual build-up of demand-pull inflationary pressures.",
        "Overall financial conditions were accommodative and conductive to economic growth.",
        "Financial stability remained sound overall.",
        "The Committee viewed that structural factors partly contributed to inflation becoming less responsive to economic growth despite the economy growing at potential.",
        "Meanwhile the Committee noted that it would be important to monitor the build-up of financial system vulnerabilities that could be seen in underestimation of potential changes in financial conditions, especially competition in the mortgage market that led to looser credit standards.",
        "This was reflected in a rising share of new mortgage loans with the loan-to-value was an increasing share of mortgage loans extended to borrowers for a second or more homes with credit standards deteriorating.",
        "Furthermore, the share of non-performing loans in mortgage loans increased.",
        "Meanwhile, the oversupply of condominiums in certain areas remained high.",

        "The Committee discussed key considerations underpinning policy decision.",
        "- 5 (1) The Thai economy continued to gain traction, with growth starting to become more broad-based as seen in several economic sectors.",

        "Private investment continued to expand with additional support from government projects that became more concrete.",
        "Merchandise exports were expected to expand albeit at a slightly slower pace given the impact of trade protectionism.",
        "The Committee viewed that the Thai economy still encountered risks arising from possible additional announcement of US trade protectionism and retaliatory measures from US trading partners, which could affect supply chains in Asia and could result in trade diversion.",
        "Moreover, the Committee noted that appreciation of the baht relative to those of trading partner currencies could affect business competitiveness.",

        "The strength of private consumption and progress on public investment must be monitored going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, some members viewed that the economy was sufficiently robust and expanded above potential.",
        "Moreover, they viewed that monetary policy was exceptionally accommodative for a prolonged period, as reflected in the policy rate that was in the down cycle since 2011 and remained at a low level for the longest period compared with other instances in the past.",
        "Therefore, they viewed that a gradual reduction in accommodative monetary policy toward a normal level would not affect economic growth.",
        "Instead, it would reduce financial stability risks, and this would be conducive to sustainable economic growth in the long term.",
        "(2) Headline inflation was expected to rise gradually.",
        "However, downside risks remained as fresh food prices could be highly volatile depending on weather conditions and agricultural output.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation was projected to slightly edge up given the gradual buildup of demand-pull inflationary pressures.",

        "The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy had allowed the headline inflation trajectory to be consistent with the inflation target.",
        "The Committee viewed that a prolonged period of low inflation was due mainly to supply-side factors and structural changes despite the economy continuing to expand.",
        "As such, some Committee members viewed that maintaining the current level of monetary policy accommodation would not accelerate inflation.",
        "(3) Financial stability remained sound overall but there were some pockets of risks that had yet to show signs of improvements and might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability going forward.",
        "In the Committee’s view the financial system showed signs of increased vulnerability in the property sector, where financial institutions competed in extending mortgage loans, willing to bear higher risks and resulting in loosening credit standards.",
        "In this regard, the risks that the Committee would monitor closely included (1) household debt accumulation which had yet to show clear signs of deleveraging, while the prolonged low interest rate environment and low rates of return could affect savings going forward and (2) other types of search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment which could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "For example, savings cooperatives continued to provide high returns to members, resulting in high growth of their assets that could pressure them to search for - 6 higher returns.",
        "Likewise, in the prolonged low interest rate environment the issuance of corporate bonds was concentrated among large corporations, which tended to invest more in non-core businesses and overseas businesses.",
        "This would pose greater risks to business operations.",
        "Most Committee members viewed that financial stability risks remained manageable.",
        "Some risks might be self-correctable through market mechanism.",
        "Others could not be corrected through market mechanism, and thus macroprudential measures could be applied in order to address and prevent pockets of risks in some economic sectors.",
        "However, some Committee members concerned that vulnerabilities might begin to build up in the financial system that potentially affect sustainable economic growth in the long term.",
        "They viewed that vulnerabilities started to become widespread due partly to the prolonged low interest rate environment, which would induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions.",
        "Consequently, relying only on macroprudential measures would not be sufficiently effective.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed conditions and appropriate timing to begin normalizing monetary policy in the future.",
        "The Committee viewed that, should economic expansion continue and inflation move more firmly within the target, the need for currently extra accommodative monetary policy would start to be gradually reduced, and the need for a policy rate increase in order to build up policy space in the future would be increasing.",
        "The Committee’s evaluation of the appropriate conditions would be data dependent, including careful assessment of the outlook of economic growth and inflation, as well as risks especially on the external front."

        "Regarding interest rate expectations prior to this meeting, continued increases in short-term money market rates and the short-end of the government yield curve showed that the market had already priced in a policy rate hike.",
        "This was consistent with survey results in which all market participants forecast a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The baht depreciated relative to the US dollar in June due to foreign investors decreasing their investments in the Thai equity and bond markets as risk in global financial markets rose from concerns over sovereign debt problems in the euro area, increased uncertainty over the US recovery, and a wait-and-see attitude of investors pending the election results.",
        "Nevertheless, the baht appreciated after the election concluded smoothly and market concerns over the sovereign debt problem in Greece lessened.",
        "The movement of the baht was consistent with that of most regional currencies in the same period.",
        "The euro depreciated amid concerns over sovereign debt that posed a key risk to financial markets.",

        "The US economy continued to experience structural problems in the labor and real estate markets.",
        "However, the surge in oil prices which impaired consumers’ purchasing power and the supply disruption in the automobile sector stemming from natural disaster in Japan were expected to abate in the second half of the year.",
        "In addition, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies would support economic recovery of the US in the periods ahead.",
        "The Japanese economy recovered faster than expected due to production and domestic consumption.",
        "The euro area continued to expand on the back of growth in core member countries, especially Germany, but sovereign debt problems remained a key risk to financial market confidence, euro area expansion, and global economic growth.",
        "Some MPC members viewed that solving the euro area sovereign debt problems would prove to be challenging; planned privatization as well as debt restructuring and roll-over will be difficult to implement.",
        "As a result, the current lending program for Greece by advanced countries may only serve to delay eventual and necessary correction.",
        "In addition, some members noted that the euro area sovereign debt problems have yet to show any discernible impact on the real economy that may eventually spill over into Thailand’s economy and exports.",

        "Manufacturing and exports were therefore expected to rebound in the second half of the year.",
        "Going forward, demand was expected to be robust from (1) an upward trend in domestic and foreign purchase orders, (2) continued expansion in planned private investment, (3) favorable credit conditions especially from lending by government-owned specialized financial institutions and (4) augmented fiscal spending after the formation of a new government.",
        "Despite a slowdown in the rise of prepared food costs, continued upward adjustments in the prices of prepared foods together with high energy prices resulted in inflationary pressure remaining at an elevated level.",
        "The government’s extension of cost-of-living alleviation measures may slow the rise of measured inflation but once the measures expire, inflation may accelerate.",
        "In addition, the economic policy of the new government, such as the minimum wage increase, will add to inflationary pressure.",
        "Although the minimum wage bill is relatively small compared to total costs of businesses, increasing the minimum wage at a rate greater than productivity growth under strong economic expansion may result in greater pass-through to average wage and overall prices, thus adversely affecting business outlook and inflation expectations.",
        "Many members viewed that the real minimum wage in recent history had not changed significantly.",
        "Increasing the nominal minimum wage to levels commensurate with the rising cost of living would therefore be appropriate.",
        "However, an abrupt one-time increase in the minimum wage nationwide at a rate faster than labor productivity growth would be a challenge in view of the burden of adjustment imposed on the business sector.",
        "The MPC assessed that there is considerable uncertainty over the potential additional fiscal spending, particularly in 2012.",
        "However, fiscal prudence would require that the government should (1) gradually phase in its spending over time; (2) prioritize its projects; (3) target those with the greatest needs; and (4) place emphasis on investment to improve productive capacity that would ensure a sustainable increase in growth and standard of living.",
        "Simultaneously, tax reform should be implemented to increase government revenue in line with rising expenditure.",
        "Members viewed the increased price pressure from higher prepared food and oil prices amid strong economic growth and continued fiscal stimulus to be the key factor in assessing the risks to growth and inflation and the monetary policy decision.",
        "Members assessed that the global economy still retained its growth momentum.",
        "The stabilization of oil prices at high levels and sovereign debt problems in the euro area continued to be key risks in the second half of the year.",
        "The Thai economy expanded from both domestic and external demand.",
        "Price pressure remained a key risk due to continued increase in prepared food and energy prices and a narrowing output gap which may result in persistently greater pass-through from production costs to inflation.",
        "The extension of the cost-of-living alleviation measures may slow the rise in measured inflation figures but other measures such as the prospective increases in the minimum wage and fiscal spending amid continued economic growth will likely add to inflationary pressure and may heighten inflation expectations.",
        "Members discussed the risks to the Thai economy going forward such as spillovers from the Greek debt problem to other euro area economies and the uncertain US economic outlook.",
        "Upon evaluation, members judged that the risks to inflation outweighed the risks to growth especially in light of continued fiscal stimulus which may add to inflationary pressure.",
        "As a result, a continued increase in the policy rate would be needed to contain inflation, particularly as it is demand-driven.",
        "Nevertheless, given the global economy’s current sensitivity to various risk factors and fiscal policy uncertainty due to the change in government, the MPC decided not to alter the pace of policy rate adjustments and would closely monitor the global economic recovery, progress in resolving the euro area sovereign debt problems, and fiscal policy formulation of the new government.",
        "The MPC therefore decided unanimously to raise the policy interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, from 3.00 to 3.25 per cent per annum, effective immediately to maintain economic stability and anchor inflation expectations.",
        "Publication date: 15 June 2011 Transmission from the policy rate to commercial bank rates continued to be effective.",
        "Many commercial banks raised both lending and deposit rates following the policy rate hike from the previous MPC meeting (20 April 2011).",
        "In addition, commercial bank rates have responded well in the past during both upward and downward interest rate cycles.",
        "Regarding interest rate expectations prior to this meeting, short-term money market rates and a rise in the short-end of the government yield curve showed that the market had priced in a policy rate hike.",
        "This was consistent with survey results in which all market participants forecasted a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Increased risk in global financial markets from sovereign debt problems in the euro area contributed to a decrease in foreign investment in the Thai equity and bond markets.",
        "This pattern was similarly observed in regional financial markets.",
        "The baht and the majority of other regional currencies depreciated relative to the US dollar as investors increased holdings of US dollar assets amid higher risk in global financial markets.",
        "The euro depreciated in line with lower market expectations of an increase in rate differential after the ECB signaled its intention to slow the pace of tightening.",

        "The US economy began to show signs of a slowdown in consumption growth as a result of increased inflation.",
        "The Japanese economy contracted in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of the natural disaster but was expected to resume expansion in the second half of the year due to (1) disbursement of government spending starting at the end of the second quarter, (2) reconstruction of damaged factories and (3) resolution of supply shortage largely by the third quarter.",
        "The euro area economy would continue to expand on the back of growth in core member countries, such as Germany and France, but risks from sovereign debt problems remained from periphery member countries especially Greece, which failed to lower its fiscal deficit as planned.",
        "Some members noted that sovereign debt problems have yet to impact growth in core member countries.",
        "Meanwhile, the Asian economy expanded robustly due to both external and internal demand.",
        "The Thai economy expanded well in the first quarter of this year.",
        "Private investment, exports and agricultural production expanded more than expected despite the clearly discernable impact of the Japan crisis on manufacturing production in the second quarter.",
        "Latest data showed that production would recover rapidly in the second half of the year.",
        "In particular, the automobiles sector would recover faster than other countries in the region, as Thailand serves as a production and export base and therefore was one of the first to receive automobile parts from Japan.",
        "As a result, manufacturing would return to normal levels without compromising export targets for the entire year.",
        "In addition, the electronics sector was not affected by the supply disruption, due to availability of parts from alternative sources, and would continue to expand.",
        "Going forward, the Thai economy’s growth momentum should be sustained by robust farm income, strong employment conditions and supportive credit growth.",
        "Inflation in the Global Economy and Domestic Economy Inflationary pressure increased in many regions in line with high oil and commodity prices.",
        "Oil and commodity prices remained elevated despite prospects of some slowdown in the future.",
        "As a result, inflation would continue to increase in many regions, especially in Asia where tight labor markets and closing output gaps magnify the risk of second-round inflation.",
        "In contrast, accelerating inflation in the US and euro area would probably not give rise to significant second-round inflation given the degree of slack in these economies.",
        "Nevertheless, rising inflationary pressure prompted many countries, especially those in Asia, to pursue tighter monetary policy to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "Inflationary pressure in the Thai economy increased more than expected primarily due to upward adjustments in the prices of processed foods on the back of simultaneous increase in costs across many categories of raw foods.",
        "The price of raw foods rose partly due to the surge in global food price amid global structural change from expanded population and income.",
        "Some members noted that the aforementioned linkages partly arose because exports to global markets resulted in less supply for domestic markets, thereby driving up domestic raw food price pressure.",
        "Going forward, processed food price hikes may persist as certain firms have yet to adjust prices.",
        "Although food price increases have yet to result in significant rises in overall prices, robust domestic demand may lead to greater pass-through of production costs to overall prices.",
        "As a result, core inflation may breach the upper end of the target band earlier than expected in the third and fourth quarters of this year.",
        "Members emphasized rising inflationary pressure as a result of upward adjustments in processed food prices linked to high costs and robust economic expansion in assessing the balance of risks to growth and inflation.",
        "Members assessed that the Japan crisis would have limited impact on the growth of the Thai economy.",
        "As a result, the growth momentum of the Thai economy would remain.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation risk rose, as reflected in greater-than-expected price pressure in the processed foods category on the back of rising costs.",
        "Inflation expectations continued to increase amid elevated oil and commodity prices.",
        "Some members observed that risks to economic expansion stemmed from the possibility that the global recovery may prove to be slower than expected.",
        "The US economy posted lower growth than expected in the first quarter.",
        "In addition, sovereign debt problems in the euro area remained a key risk to the economy.",
        "Lastly, the domestic political situation post-election may have implications on both growth and inflation going forward.",
        "However, those members judged that risks to inflation Members assessed that robust domestic demand may lead to greater pass-through of production costs to overall prices.",
        "As a result, there is a risk that inflation may accelerate and persist.",
        "In the baseline scenario, core inflation was projected to breach the upper end of the target band in the next two quarters before returning within the band under the assumptions that (1) oil and commodity prices would not surge again and (2) policy rate normalization would continue in the period ahead.",
        "Members discussed the need to raise the policy rate by more than 0.25 percentage points but concluded that a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points would be more appropriate given that financial markets and the economy have thus far responded well in the desired manner to gradual rate hikes, risks to growth in the G3 economies have yet to be fully resolved, and the political situation post-election remains uncertain.",
        "The MPC therefore decided unanimously to raise the policy interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, from 2.75 to 3.00 per cent per annum, effective immediately.",

        "Market volatility increased in tandem with heightened risks in global financial markets, especially on concerns over the US credit rating downgrade and debt ceiling problems.",
        "The resulting risk aversion weakened the Thai baht, reversing appreciation pressures in July.",
        "Looking ahead, the baht was expected to resume its appreciation path as portfolio inflows were expected to resume once global financial markets stabilize and in light of the continued strong economic fundamentals of Asia and Thailand.",
        "Since the beginning of August, the medium- to long-term yields on government bonds declined sharply, owing partly to a drop in US government bond yields and partly to portfolio shift towards longer maturities by foreign investors.",
        "Meanwhile, money market rates and shortterm government bond yields increased as the market priced in a policy rate hike.",
        "This was consistent with survey results which indicated that most market participants anticipated a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points at this meeting.",
        "Members assessed that risks to growth of advanced economies (G3) had increased.",
        "The US economy will likely grow at a modest rate for longer than expected, causing the market to perceive higher risk of another recession.",
        "Nevertheless, factors that will help support growth and lower such risk include (1) higher consumer spending driven by lower oil prices and the recovery in the automobile sector after supply disruptions ended; stance.",
        "Meanwhile, the impact from the US credit rating downgrade had been limited but may still affect risk premium for private financing in the periods ahead.",
        "The euro area expanded more slowly than expected as a result of higher inflation and the end of stimulus packages in some member countries.",
        "Economic growth was expected to moderate given the planned fiscal consolidation.",
        "However, robust exports and employment conditions in core member countries, especially Germany, should help support the euro area growth overall.",
        "The Japanese economy continued to recover from reconstruction expenditures despite the credit rating downgrade.",
        "Growth in other parts of Asia showed some moderation with higher risks to exports to advanced economies.",
        "Nevertheless, intra- regional trade, particularly rising exports to China, strong domestic demand reflected in high growth of retail sales and credit in many economies, as well as large fiscal and monetary policy space, should help cushion such increased risks.",
        "However, inflationary pressures remained elevated in many Asian economies including Thailand.",
        "The Thai economy expanded during the first half of the year, supported by both domestic and external demand, despite the slowdown in the second quarter owing to the impact of the disaster in Japan.",
        "The main growth engines in the latter half of this year are domestic demand and a recovery in manufacturing production following the end of the supply disruptions in the automobile sector.",
        "Private consumption and investment was expected to expand in line with good prospects for both farm and non-farm income, improved confidence, expansion in credit, and rising investment trend in the automobile, electronics and electrical appliance industries.",
        "Members expressed concerns about the impact of the slowdown in advanced economies on the export sector.",
        "However, such impact can be partly cushioned by economies; and (3) ongoing stimulus from public consumption and investment.",
        "In this regard, members deemed it necessary to closely monitor developments in the global economy and their impact on the Thai economy.",
        "Inflationary pressures remained high with core inflation trending upwards from strong domestic demand and the continued pass-through of higher costs to prepared food.",
        "The MPC assessed that although inflation should moderate during the latter part of the year due to a cut in the Oil Fund levies, upside risks in the periods thereafter remained significant owing to (1) the closing output gap; (2) inflation expectations which remained high; and scheme that may cause inflation expectations to increase.",
        "All members agreed that short-term policy goal of interest rate normalization remained appropriate in order to address inflationary pressure and preserve financial stability.",
        "Members also agreed that risks to growth had increased as a result of global economic slowdown, and that risks to inflation had also increased.",
        "However, _members differ somewhat on the weight assigned to such risks._ Two members assessed that the risk of a global recession and consequential impact on the Thai economy was material enough to justify pausing the policy rate increase at this meeting in order to assess the extent of the slowdown in advanced economies given their limited policy space to support growth.",
        "Moreover, although domestic inflation remained high, short-run inflationary pressures from the government’s stimulus package may not be material given the implementation time lag and only a small disbursement was expected in the second half of the year.",
        "Should it become clearer at the next meeting that the global economy does not enter a recessionary period and the Thai economy continues to expand well, policy interest rate can still be raised then.",
        "Five members viewed that the continuation of the policy rate hike by another 0.25 percentage points was appropriate.",
        "They assessed that despite higher risks to Thailand’s economic prospects due to the slowdown in advanced economies, there are factors that should mitigate the risk of a global recession of the magnitude experienced in the recent crisis.",
        "Moreover, intra-regional trade and domestic demand in Asia, including Thailand, would continue to support the growth momentum.",
        "Meanwhile, upward risk to domestic inflation increased significantly and may continue into future periods.",
        "While the government’s stimulus package may help cushion risks to growth from the advanced economies, it could increase upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "Thus, continued interest rate normalization was deemed necessary to address future risks to inflation given the time lag in the transmission mechanism.",
        "Members also assessed that since real interest rates were still negative, gradual increase in the policy interest rate would signal policy continuity towards normalization and facilitate a smooth adjustment for the economy.",

        "The decline in confidence among international investors led them to curtail their holdings of risky assets including equities, commodities, and emerging market bonds.",
        "Stock market indices thus declined across the globe; the baht depreciated along with other regional currencies; and Thai government bond yields experienced substantial volatility.",
        "In addition, considerable uncertainty in global financial markets raised funding costs and led to tighter dollar liquidity in many countries, including Thailand.",
        "However, Thai baht money market rates and short-term government bond yields remained stable as most market participants anticipated that the MPC would maintain the policy rate at 3.50 percent per annum at this meeting.",

        "Meanwhile, despite a moderation in the price of commodities, including oil, inflationary pressure in Asia remained elevated as continued domestic demand growth facilitated the pass-through of higher costs into final prices.",
        "Economic growth in Thailand was expected to decelerate due to the weakening of the global economy and the impact of floods.",
        "Preliminary data for the third quarter indicated a rebound in economic activity as the negative repercussion of supply chain disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan dissipated.",
        "However, economic growth in the last quarter of this year was likely to be much lower than previously anticipated because of (1) severe disruptions to economic activity from widespread flooding, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and (2) a moderation in export growth on the back of a softer world economy and a deceleration of commodity price increases.",
        "Nevertheless, reconstruction spending and government stimulus measures would provide support for domestic demand to pick up next year.",
        "Overall, the flood crisis was not expected to damage Thailand’s longterm growth potential.",
        "Members were concerned about the impact of the still-evolving flood situation, especially on production in key export sectors including rice, automobile, electronics and electrical appliances, as well as tourism, all of which were already feeling the effects of a weaker global economy.",
        "As a result, Thai export growth was expected to slow down, and members stressed the need to closely monitor the situation and continuously assess the impact on the Thai economy.",
        "Inflationary pressure continued to be sustained by growth in domestic demand, though declines in input costs, such as moderated oil prices from a weaker global economy, as well as more stable inflation expectations would help to mitigate inflationary pressure in the periods ahead.",
        "Nonetheless, members assessed that upside risks to inflation remained from the anticipated pickup in public and private spending after flooding ends.",
        "Six members decided to maintain the policy rate at 3.50 percent per annum on account of increased downside risks to growth from the global economic slowdown and the impact of floods, which had already brought about partial halt in some production sectors.",
        "However, the flood crisis was not expected to affect the economy’s long-term potential, and reconstruction spending and government stimulus measures should provide support to domestic demand going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, flood-related shortages could push prices of some goods up temporarily.",
        "Although inflation remained high and warranted close monitoring, upside risks were limited.",
        "In this context, monetary policy could give higher weight to supporting the reconstruction of the economy.",
        "Maintaining the policy rate at the current level, which is still low and supportive of economic growth, was thus deemed appropriate.",
        "However, heightened uncertainty in the global economy and the ongoing flood crisis warranted continued close monitoring.",
        "One member viewed that the risks from the global economy exceeded what was previously anticipated and the problem was likely to be protracted.",
        "Moreover, the flood damage appeared to be severe, while upward pressure on inflation did not rise significantly.",
        "As such, a reduction of the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to better facilitate economic recovery was deemed appropriate.",

        "The shift was consistent with a survey of market participants which indicated expectations of a 0.25 percentage point hike this meeting.",
        "Risks to inflation have increased due to record-high food prices and the surge in oil prices amid unrest in the Middle East.",
        "Nevertheless, the supply shock, particularly high oil prices, was expected to have a limited impact on economic expansion due to (1) increased global resiliency to oil price shocks as oil dependency had fallen as reflected in lower oil expenditure to GDP ratio, (2) real oil prices were currently lower than its peak in 2008 and (3) many Asian economies maintain price controls or provide subsidies as fiscal room remained.",
        "Some MPC members raised concerns about the impact of the surge in oil and commodity prices on the global recovery.",
        "However, MPC members noted that the oil price spike would likely be temporary and would not remain excessively high for an extended period since political unrest in the Middle East was not expected to become widespread to the extent that might threaten oil supply networks and global inventory.",
        "Also, OPEC excess capacity remained high and could offset any reduction in production by countries experiencing unrest.",
        "In addition, the recent upward trend in oil prices reflected underlying global demand due to economic expansion, particularly in the emerging markets.",

        "The impact of high oil prices would therefore not have a significant impact on continued economic expansion.",
        "Additional supporting factors included (1) the fact that the current oil shock was not as severe compared to previous shocks, (2) the Thai economy’s lower oil dependency (3) and diesel price administration.",
        "Nevertheless, some MPC members commented that the Thai economy’s substitution away from oil toward alternative energy sources may eventually lead to the gradual lifting of government price administration of alternative energy, which could result in higher inflationary pressure.",

        "Some members expressed concerns over the severity of the impact of the Japan crisis on the production network, but assessed that it would not weigh on the overall growth momentum of Inflationary pressure increased due to: (1) oil and commodity prices which continued to rise amid strong economic expansion; (2) the lifting of government price administration for various goods which facilitates the pass-through from production costs to goods prices as reflected in rising inflation expectations; and (3) the postponement of the lifting of the diesel price control may lead to an increase in pent-up price pressure and pose an upside risk to inflation going forward especially if oil prices rise by more than anticipated when the control is lifted.",
        "Transmission from the policy rate to commercial bank rates continued to be effective.",
        "Many commercial banks raised both lending and deposit rates following the rate hike from the previous MPC meeting (9 March 2011).",
        "Regarding interest rate expectations prior to this meeting, a rise along the short and medium-term parts of the yield curve showed that the market had priced in a rate hike.",
        "This was consistent with survey results in which all market participants expected a rate hike of Robust economic growth contributed to increased capital inflows into the equity and bond markets especially in bonds with maturities of less than one year.",
        "Other economies in the region also experienced increased capital inflows.",
        "The baht and other currencies (except the Japanese yen) appreciated relative to the US dollar as investors sought non-US assets due to growth differentials and widening interest rate gaps given expectations that the Federal Reserve would hold its policy rate until the end of the year.",
        "The euro strengthened following the ECB rate hike.",
        "The Japanese yen weakened continuously due to carry trade transactions following temporary appreciation after the earthquake.",
        "Members emphasized the impact of two recent major events--the Japan crisis and persistently high oil prices--on the balance of risks to growth and inflation.",
        "For six members, mounting inflationary pressure remained the primary risk and continued to warrant a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Japan crisis posed a downside risk to the Thai economy but its impact was expected to be temporary.",
        "On the risk to inflation, those members viewed that inflation pressure had become more apparent and remained the key risk as reflected in rising inflation expectations amid the economic upturn.",
        "In such an environment, pass-through from production costs to goods prices may intensify and add to inflationary pressure.",
        "As a result, rate normalization should continue given low real interest rates that currently prevail.",
        "Some members noted that exchange-rate appreciation could mitigate some of the pressure exerted by high global oil and commodity prices on inflation expectations; however, the effectiveness of the exchange rate in anchoring inflation expectations was considered to be limited compared to the interest rate tool.",
        "For one member, the crisis in Japan called for an interest rate pause.",
        "In light of the risk that the Japan crisis could become more drawn-out than expected, a rate pause would give the MPC more time to fully assess the situation.",
        "However, going forward, rate normalization should be maintained.",
        "The MPC therefore decided to raise the policy interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, from 2.50 to 2.75 per cent per annum, effective immediately.",
        "Members discussed the neutral rate that will mark the end of the normalization cycle.",
        "The level of the neutral rate varies according to the economic outlook at each point in time and is thus difficult to pin down precisely.",
        "Nevertheless, current negative real interest rates amid output gap closure reflect accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The MPC decided to release the point estimates of both the baseline forecasts for GDP and inflation in the Inflation Report to replace previously published range estimates.",
        "The fan charts remain.",
        "These changes have the following benefits: (1) allow the public to better interpret changes in the forecasts, particularly in instances where the forecast range does not change; (2) provide better indication regarding the direction of monetary policy; and (3) further improve communication by the MPC following the publication of its edited minutes.",
        "The euro area’s sovereign debt problem persisted and had increasing ramifications on financial markets.",
        "Funding costs for both government and private sectors rose noticeably.",
        "Credit Default Swap (CDS) premia increased for euro area countries such as Italy and Greece as well as for some Asian economies.",
        "Interest rates in the US dollar and euro interbank markets also rose, reflecting further decline in investors’ confidence.",
        "As investors curtailed their holdings of risky assets, equity markets became more volatile and the Thai baht, along with regional currencies, depreciated against major currencies such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen.",
        "The floods had only a temporary and limited impact on the Thai financial market.",
        "While demand for cash increased notably during the crisis, transaction volume in the interbank and foreign exchange markets decreased slightly.",
        "Both cash demand and financial market activities have now returned to their normal levels.",
        "The significant impact of the floods on the real economy led most market participants to anticipate that the MPC would reduce the policy rate at this meeting.",
        "Downside risks to the global economy increased as the impact of the euro area’s sovereign debt problem on the major economies became more apparent.",
        "The probability of the euro area falling into a recession increased markedly given sharp declines in industrial production and consumer confidence.",
        "The US economy showed signs of a stronger recovery, particularly with respect to production and consumption indicators.",
        "Nevertheless, output growth would remain below potential as weaknesses in labor and housing markets continued to weigh on the economy.",
        "In addition, US financial markets remained susceptible to spillover effects from problems in the euro area.",
        "Economic growth in Asia softened as export growth moderated on the back of global economic slowdown.",
        "Meanwhile, persistent inflationary pressure in the region started to level off as global commodity prices moderated.",
        "Most countries therefore decided to keep policy rates on hold, pending clearer assessment of the repercussions from the global economic slowdown.",
        "Members were concerned about the euro area’s problem especially on the sustainability of the currency union and the economic costs involved in the periods ahead.",
        "They also viewed that the lack of confidence in the euro currency and financial conditions of euro area banks may pose risks to the Thai financial sector and the overall economy, especially through indirect channels emanating from the wide ranging business scope of euro area banks.",
        "The MPC thus stressed the need to closely monitor the situation.",
        "The impact of the floods on the Thai economy was greater than previously anticipated.",
        "Apart from the direct impact on agriculture and manufacturing production in areas that were inundated, there was significant indirect impact through supply chain disruptions especially in the automobile, electronics, and electrical appliances sectors.",
        "Private sector confidence declined substantially.",
        "The MPC revised up its assessment of the economic damage of the floods from 1.1 percent to 2.1 percent of GDP and lowered its growth projection for 2011 from 2.6 percent in the last meeting to 1.8 percent.",
        "Despite the severity of the floods, the MPC expected a reasonably swift recovery.",
        "Most economic activities were expected to return to normal by mid-2012, a time frame that is consistent with government restoration measures exerting their full impact and in line with survey results indicating that a majority of firms expected full resumption of production within six months.",
        "Overall, economic growth is projected to stand at 4.8 percent in 2012.",
        "The MPC stressed the importance of the ability of the private sector to obtain adequate financing for restoration purposes.",
        "For firms that will be compensated with insurance payouts, there was concern whether they could obtain necessary financing in the interim before those payouts are received given the potentially long delays involved in damage assessments.",
        "The MPC expected financial institutions to provide relatively low-risk bridge loans to such firms to support a smooth recovery of the economy.",
        "Inflationary pressure continued to be sustained by the anticipated pickup in private sector demand associated with post-flood restoration spending as well as from government stimulus measures, including an increase in the budget deficit, increase in minimum wage, and the rice mortgage program.",
        "However, the slowdown of commodity prices in line with the global economy would help to mitigate inflationary pressure to some extent.",
        "Meanwhile, price increases driven by flood-related shortages, such as in vegetables and fruits, are expected to be temporary and only limited to certain areas.",
        "In addition, government administrative measures and relatively stable inflation expectations would help contain the risk of inflation accelerating to a level that would threaten economic stability.",
        "The MPC assessed that the risk of a global economic slowdown has increased from the previous meeting while upside risks to inflation remained limited.",
        "Although the flooding has eased and the economy has already moved onto the restoration phase, private sector confidence remained weak.",
        "In this context, monetary policy could play a greater role in supporting economic recovery, especially by facilitating investment to restore productive capacity, without compromising the primary goal of maintaining economic stability.",
        "The MPC thus agreed to reduce the policy rate in this meeting.",
        "Nonetheless, members differed in their assessment of the degree of policy accommodation needed.",
        "Two members deemed that a reduction of the policy rate by 0.5 percent per annum was appropriate given the high risk of a further weakening of the global economy stemming from the protracted debt problem in the euro area that is more serious than previously assessed, as well as the limited policy room for further stimulus measures among G3 economies.",
        "At the same time, the impact of flooding on the Thai economy was much more severe than previously projected.",
        "Given that upside inflation risks appeared to be contained, in part due to the moderation in commodity prices from a slower world economy, monetary policy should be eased substantially in order to frontload the stimulus provided to support economic recovery.",
        "The reduction in funding costs for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and households that need credit during this time was viewed as especially important in facilitating the restoration process.",
        "Five members decided to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent per annum based on their judgment that the current monetary policy stance was already accommodative and that private sector spending, supported by strong financial institutions and government stimulus measures, would generate sufficient recovery momentum.",
        "Therefore, the reduction in the policy rate should be commensurate with the needs of the economy without posing additional risks to economic stability.",
        "In this respect, a more measured policy rate reduction was seen as conducive to bolstering confidence while limiting the potential for undue volatility in the exchange rate that may hamper private investment through their impact on import costs.",
        "Moreover, should conditions change materially, monetary policy could be adjusted as warranted.",
        "Some members viewed that in shoring up private sector confidence and alleviating constraints on SMEs, a reduction in the policy rate constituted only one contributing factor.",
        "More importantly, confidence would hinge on the government’s ability to implement a credible plan to resolve the flood-related structural problems to prevent the recurrence of the crisis, whereas the underlying challenge for SMEs lay in the difficulties in obtain financing rather than the cost of funds.",
        "The MPC therefore voted 5 to 2 to reduce the policy rate by 0.25 percent, from 3.50 percent to 3.25 percent per annum.",
        "The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments in the global economy as well as progress on domestic restoration efforts and stands ready to take appropriate policy actions.",
        "Publication date: 26 January 2011 The Thai baht was volatile, appreciating relative to the US dollar on the back of capital inflows while depreciating in the beginning of 2011 due to sales of equity by foreign investors after better-thanexpected US economic data.",
        "Going forward, investors are expected to give greater weight to recovery in major countries, resulting in greater two-way movement of the baht as opposed to continued appreciation pressure observed in the previous year.",
        "In addition, the yield curve shifted slightly upwards following the previous MPC meeting reflecting market pricing of an interest rate hike this meeting.",
        "The majority of market participants surveyed expected the current MPC meeting to result in a rise in the policy rate by 0.25 percentage points while some expected an overall rise of 0.50-1.00 percentage points in 2011.",
        "Risks to global economic growth have fallen.",
        "The US economic recovery continued to strengthen.",
        "A survey of economists indicated that the majority viewed that the US economy would grow faster than forecasted and that employment would improve although risks from house prices remained.",
        "Nevertheless, certain MPC members expressed concerns regarding the continually high rate of unemployment.",
        "The European economy stabilized although money markets remained volatile due to concerns over sovereign debt.",
        "However, core member countries, especially Germany, are projected to become drivers of growth.",
        "The Japanese economy still faced deflation while the appreciating yen may impede growth going forward.",
        "The Asian economy continued to grow on the back of domestic demand and exports destined to both within the region as well as new markets with high growth potential.",
        "Overall, the region is becoming less reliant on the G3 economies.",
        "However, the risk to inflation for the region as a whole increased significantly.",
        "The uneven growth of advanced economies and emerging markets has led to varied monetary policy responses.",
        "Advanced economies pursued accommodative monetary policy to safeguard economic recovery while emerging markets tightened to maintain price stability and are expected to accelerate the pace of interest rate normalization in 2011.",
        "As a result, challenges for Asia going forward are likely to come from capital flow volatility and the appropriate pacing of monetary policy tightening.",
        "Thai economic growth was projected to return to its long-term trend.",
        "The Thai economy continued to expand in Q4 of 2010 from the previous quarter in line with domestic and external demand.",
        "Going forward, growth will be supported by 1) private consumption expansion on the back of both agricultural and non-agricultural income, increase in the minimum wage, low unemployment and robust consumer confidence and 2) private investment, which despite some slowdown after accelerating in the prior period, should expand going forward due to favourable business confidence, high capacity utilization in many industries, and future investment plans to meet internal and external demand for goods in services and 3) fiscal stimulus from government income support programs for mostly low-income earners and government investment for both large projects and state enterprises which was expected to increase from the previous year.",
        "Export growth in the previous year exceeded expectations and was expected to continue its growth trend into 2011 due to Chinese and ASEAN economic expansion as well as the rising trend in advanced orders.",
        "In addition, various research houses projected strong export growth in 2011 supported by a rising export prices (except for fisheries where there is low pricing power) which was expected to partly mitigate the adverse effects of baht appreciation.",
        "Tourism activity was solid and was expanded going forward.",
        "In the monetary sector, private credit expanded well together with overall economic growth.",
        "The expansion in commercial bank credit was primarily due to demand from households.",
        "Corporate loans also increased and were projected to grow continuously in 2011.",
        "Commercial banks rapidly raised both deposit and loan rates following the policy rate hikes.",
        "In regards to price stability, inflation pressure increased from the previous period.",
        "Headline inflation accelerated in line with the rise in wages while core inflation picked up due to the pass-through of production costs into goods prices, especially prepared food and seasonings and condiments.",
        "The MPC assessed that inflation pressure going forward has increased due to both cost-push and demandpull factors.",
        "Cost-push factors include: 1) upward trend in oil and commodity prices on the back of global economic expansion; 2) increased pass-through from the Production Price Index (PPI) into Consumer Price Index (CPI) as authorities allowed price increases in many product categories; and 3) gradual pass-through of production costs to consumers as producers’ ability to absorb such costs became more limited.",
        "Demand-pull factors include: 1) a diminishing output gap as output growth neared potential while producers have revised their inflation expectations upwards for some time.",
        "These factors would speed up price adjustment going forward.",
        "In addition, some MPC members expressed concerns over the possibility that inflation may breach its target this year.",
        "The MPC viewed that the risk to inflation had increased relative to the risk to growth compared The global economic recovery strengthened compared to the previous meeting.",
        "The risk of a double dip recession in the US declined while Asia faced the challenge of rising prices, particularly those of commodities.",
        "The Thai economy continued to return to its long-term growth trend.",
        "The MPC viewed that domestic demand would become the principal driver of growth in the coming period.",
        "In addition, strong export performance pointed to Thailand’s economic resilience in face of the baht appreciating in the previous period.",
        "Inflationary pressure clearly increased due to rising oil and commodity prices, the return of the Thai economy to its long-term growth trend and pent-up pressure from delayed price adjustments.",
        "At the same time, increases in the minimum and civil service wages may boost consumption expenditures more than expected and lead to a rise in inflation expectations going forward.",
        "Some MPC members were concerned that low real interest rates may foster financial imbalances, depress savings and lead to asset bubbles in the future.",
        "MPC members were unanimous in seeing the need to maintain continuity in signaling rate normalization.",
        "Robust economic expansion together with significantly increased inflationary pressure led to some members discussing the possibility of a rate hike of 0.5 percentage points.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority of MPC members viewed that policy rate adjustment should be gradual while taking into account that the neutral rate depends on changing economic circumstances.",
        "The MPC therefore decided unanimously (7 to 0) to raise the policy interest rate by 0.25 percentage points per annum, from 2.00 to 2.25 per cent per annum, effective immediately."

    "2016": [
        "The global economy recovered at a slower pace compared with the assessment at the previous meeting due to weaker Asian economies whose adverse spillover impacts on the G3 economies became more apparent.",
        "As a result, market participants anticipated the US Federal Reserve to raise the policy rate more slowly despite the continuing improvement in the fundamentals of the US economy.",
        "Meanwhile, further monetary policy accommodation by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan was expected to provide some additional support to the recovery of the euro area and Japanese economies.",
        "However, growth in other Asian economies continued to slow because of both cyclical and structural factors, with some economies experiencing specific factors that further weighed on domestic demand.",
        "Taken together, the pace of global growth in 2016 was expected to remain largely unchanged from last year, in contrast with the assessment at the previous meeting where global growth was expected to pick up.",
        "In addition, the Committee judged that the relationship between global output and global trade had changed significantly such that the growth of trade volume was much lower than previous trend growth.",
        "This proved to be a major drag on exports of Asian economies including Thailand.",
        "With regard to the balance of risks to global growth, the Committee judged it tilted more to the downside owing mainly to fragility of the European financial sector.",
        "The risks surrounding China’s financial sector and its economic slowdown remained and might also affect the recovery of Asian economies going forward.",
        "Overall confidence in the financial markets improved given the likelihood of a slower pace of policy rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and recent gains in crude oil prices.",
        "Consequently, investors increased holdings of emerging market financial assets, including those of Thailand, prompting a rise in the Thai equity market indices and an appreciation of the baht against the US dollar.",
        "As the baht appreciation was in line with movements in other regional currencies, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) remained broadly unchanged from the previous meeting.",
        "With regard to the bond market, the Thai government bond yields continued to fall primarily because of a strong demand from local investors.",
        "There was no indication as yet of significant capital flows from Japan to Thailand after the Bank of Japan implemented the negative interest rate policy.",
        "The Committee anticipated that monetary policy divergence among advanced economies would continue to be a source of volatilities in financial markets and cross-border capital flows.",
        "Nevertheless, Thai financial assets proved attractive to foreign investors thanks to strong external fundamentals, together with the baht having displayed low volatility relative to regional currencies.",
        "These factors could potentially result in steady foreign capital inflows to the Thai financial markets.",
        "The Thai economy continued to recover gradually supported by fiscal spending, tourism, especially in major cities which saw a broad-based increase in foreign visitors, and a pickup in private investment in some business sectors, in particular those benefiting from government policies such as alternative energy and telecommunications.",
        "However, the overall economic momentum slowed down, following dissipation of the temporary boost from the government’s tax rebate measure around the end of last year and from the accelerated car purchases prior to the increase in vehicle excise tax this year.",
        "In addition, the value of merchandise exports still contracted significantly and looked to rebound slowly, leading to lower employment in some industries.",
        "Nevertheless, some workers were able to move into service industries which continued to expand strongly, helping to mitigate some of the negative impacts on non-farm household incomes.",
        "As a result, private consumption continued to grow, in particular, consumption of nondurable goods.",
        "According to the Committee’s assessment, the degree to which the structural problems weighed on the export sector was greater than previously anticipated.",
        "Structural constraints limiting export opportunities included shifts in the global trade structure, changes in consumer preferences, and a decline in Thailand’s export competitiveness in certain industries, especially those that had failed to make meaningful investments during the past several years to upgrade their manufacturing technology.",
        "Consequently, the recovery of exports was expected to be gradual and would likely weigh on household income and spending as well as business investment.",
        "The Committee therefore revised the 2016 growth projection to 3.1 percent, down from 3.5 percent estimated in December skewed to the downside due to the fragile outlook of the global economy and the impact of the drought that could be more severe than expected.",
        "Headline inflation remained negative largely due to global oil prices, which had declined by more than expected toward the end of last year.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation, excluding the impact of excise tax hikes on tobacco products and automobiles, edged lower, reflecting weakening price pressure from the demand side.",
        "The Committee thus revised down the headline inflation forecast for 2016 from 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent, and lowered this year’s core inflation forecast slightly from 0.9 percent to 0.8 percent.",
        "Volatile global crude oil prices continued to pose uncertainty to the headline inflation projection.",
        "Meanwhile, medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the inflation target, albeit edging down slightly.",
        "Going forward, the Committee would monitor the recovery of domestic demand and developments in inflation expectations closely.",
        "Overall risks to financial stability rose somewhat on the back of investors’ search-for-yield behavior and weakened debt service ability of farm households and SMEs due to a delayed economic recovery.",
        "Some members of the Committee noted that the financing costs of large corporations were at low levels, which could reflect some underpricing of risks.",
        "The Committee would monitor and assess these developments closely.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Although the economy was expected to grow more slowly compared to the previous assessment and the recovery was likely to be uneven across sectors, the prevailing monetary conditions were deemed accommodative and conducive to fostering overall economic recovery.",
        "The Committee was mindful of financial stability risks that could arise in the prolonged low interest rate environment, especially the search-for-yield behavior, weakened debt service ability, and elevated household debt.",
        "Consequently, the Committee decided to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "The Committee also saw the need to preserve the policy space should significant risks and uncertainty, such as from a further delay in the global recovery or intensifying geopolitical conflicts, negatively affect economic recovery going forward.",
        "Some members also judged that monetary policy easing would have provided limited support to the economy and inflation, as the current slowdown of the Thai economy was in part attributable to global and domestic structural problems.",
        "Nonetheless, all members concurred that the strengthening of the baht with respect to other currencies during some recent periods might not be as conducive to the economic recovery as it could be.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should continue to remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "Despite signs of recovery in the G3 economies on the back of improvement in private consumption, Thailand’s trading partners overall recovered at a slower pace than assessed in the previous meeting.",
        "While economic indicators for the US economy pointed to a continued recovery and the Japanese economy was expected to gain further traction thanks to the announced postponement of the increase in sales tax, forward momentum from G3 economies was not sufficient to offset the impact from the slowdown in China on Asian economies’ exports.",
        "In addition, Asian exports were negatively affected by changes in the global trade structure, such as the shift toward a domestic-based supply chain that reduced the needs for imports from Asia, and by Asian economies’ loss of export market share to China in some high-technology goods.",
        "Weak exports would weigh on Asia’s growth going forward.",
        "The balance of risks to the global economy remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Two key risks that the Committee closely monitored were as follows.",
        "First, with regard to China’s financial stability, corporate default risks had heightened.",
        "As a result, financial conditions in China could tighten further and potentially affect funding costs and corporate financing.",
        "Moreover, funding obtained outside the formal banking sector through channels such as securities firms and subsidiaries of fund companies was on the rise.",
        "Although this development somewhat helped ease financial conditions in the near term, it could increase financial stability risks in China going forward.",
        "Second, regarding the impact on the global economy of the United Kingdom’s referendum on European Union (EU) membership, the Committee assessed that the vote to exit the EU (Brexit) would create significant volatility in global financial markets in the short run and would adversely affect the UK’s trade and investment in the longer run.",
        "In addition, uncertainties regarding potential exits by other EU members could further dampen cross-border trade and investment as well as the recovery of European economies and the global economy going forward.",
        "While the Committee estimated that the direct impact of Brexit on Asian economies would likely be small given limited trade linkages with the UK, the Committee would continue to monitor developments closely, especially if European economies were significantly affected.",
        "Volatility in financial markets heightened since the previous meeting in May.",
        "Regional currencies initially depreciated following the anticipation of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve but subsequently appreciated after the release of US nonfarm payroll employment figures at the beginning of June that were lower than market expectations.",
        "During the run-up to this meeting, concerns over Brexit led investors to increase holdings of safe-haven assets and wait for the referendum results.",
        "Consequently, exchange rate volatility increased on some occasions; however, during this period, the Thai baht against the US dollar and the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) averaged out close to the levels at the time of the previous meeting.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index increased slightly.",
        "Meanwhile, Thai government bond yields edged up across all maturities, owing partly to the recent release of Thailand’s first-quarter gross domestic product figures that turned out better than market expectations, but yields remained below their 2015 averages.",
        "The Committee expected volatility in international capital flows and exchange rates to persist in the period ahead.",
        "Major contributing factors included monetary policy divergence among major advanced economies and the increasingly fragile sentiment in global financial markets.",
        "Moreover, potential surges in global financial market volatility following Brexit would warrant close monitoring.",
        "However, spillover effects of higher volatility on Thai financial markets were likely to be limited, owing to Thailand’s strong external positions that could help cushion the adverse impact from such developments.",
        "The Thai economy continued to recover, supported by effective disbursement of the fiscal budget as well as tourism that grew faster than anticipated.",
        "The latter owed partly to the expansion of new international flight routes by low-cost airlines.",
        "Private consumption picked up on the back of growth in income and employment in the service sector.",
        "At the same time, income of agricultural households started to improve as a result of higher agricultural commodity prices, especially rubber, while concerns pertaining to the impact of the drought subsided.",
        "Nevertheless, some Committee members noted that the recent strength in private consumption was due to spending on entertainment and recreation, which might not be sustainable.",
        "Moreover, part of that spending was expenditure on trips abroad by Thai residents, which might not contribute much toward Thailand’s potential growth in the long run.",
        "In this regard, the Committee would continue to monitor and assess the robustness of private consumption going forward.",
        "In addition, the Committee viewed that the service sector would become increasingly important to the Thai economy, and hence additional economic indicators for the service sector would be required for accurate economic assessment.",
        "Meanwhile, merchandise exports continued to contract, especially exports to Asian economies that were increasingly impacted by changes in the global trade structure.",
        "Such conditions meant that there remained excess production capacity in the manufacturing sector and therefore growth in private investment was expected to remain low, despite benefiting partly from public investment stimulus.",
        "The subdued private investment outlook was consistent with declining imports of raw materials and capital goods as well as the slowdown in commercial banks’ credit expansion rate compared with historical average, in line with weak demand for loan by the business sector.",
        "Additionally, decreased drawings from credit lines extended by commercial banks suggested that the recent slowdown in credit growth could be primarily attributed to subdued credit demand.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy to expand at 3.1 percent for 2016 as assessed in the previous meeting.",
        "Economic momentum from domestic demand and the tourism sector was anticipated to help offset the contraction in merchandise exports.",
        "Nevertheless, there remained downside risks from weak demand from trading partners, diminished financial capacity of households to cushion future economic shocks due to elevated debt levels, and the fragile confidence of the private sector.",
        "However, concerns pertaining to the impact of the drought subsided with the return of seasonal rainfall.",
        "For 2017, domestic demand was still expected to be the economy’s main growth driver with continued support from tourism.",
        "However, income from merchandise exports was likely to be affected by the delayed recovery of trading partners’ economies.",
        "Consequently, the Committee revised down the growth forecast for 2017 slightly from 3.3 percent to 3.2 percent.",
        "Inflationary pressure edged up slightly from the previous assessment in line with the recovery in domestic demand and higher energy prices.",
        "This was reflected in both the slight increase in core inflation and a further pickup in headline inflation from the acceleration in energy and fresh food prices in May.",
        "Overall, the Committee projected that headline inflation and core inflation for 2016 would average at 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to gradually rise and return to the lower bound of the inflation target within the latter half of 2016.",
        "In 2017, headline inflation and core inflation were expected to average at 2.2 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, subject to uncertainties in global oil prices and in the recovery of domestic demand going forward.",
        "Overall financial stability was not deemed to be a concern.",
        "However, risks arising from the prolonged low interest rate environment continued to warrant close monitoring, particularly the search-for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "In addition, there were signs of weakened debt serviceability among SMEs and households, as reflected by rising nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios of SME and consumer loans and the rising share of special mention (SM) loans across all loan types.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee gave weight to Thailand’s economic recovery which proceeded at the expected pace.",
        "However, there remained downside risks from weaker-than-expected growth in trading partners and fragility in the private sector’s sentiments.",
        "The Committee also gave due consideration to the inflation outlook where headline inflation was projected to return to the lower bound of the inflation target within the latter half of 2016 as previously anticipated.",
        "The Committee assessed that inflationary pressure would pick up gradually with the ongoing economic recovery and rising global energy prices, and that medium-term inflation expectations remained well-anchored around the inflation target.",
        "In addition, the Committee judged that monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery as reflected in low real interest rates.",
        "Total corporate financing and household credits also continued to expand, although certain businesses faced limitations in gaining access to credit.",
        "Incidentally, some members of the Committee viewed that keeping the rate on hold at this meeting would also help preserve policy space for future needs, should the ongoing economic recovery be affected by risks such as financial stability concerns in China as well as Brexit.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to recover at a pace close to the previous assessment.",
        "The US economy continued to recover, mainly driven by private consumption, which led the market to expect another hike in the federal funds rate by the end of this year.",
        "The recovery of European economies remained weak, but continued monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank was likely to help sustain economic growth.",
        "The Japanese economy, supported by government stimulus measures, was expected to continue expanding at a gradual pace.",
        "However, the appreciation of the yen due to its perceived safe haven status might not be conducive to the ongoing recovery.",
        "With regard to China and other Asian economies, growth was driven by additional government stimulus measures, together with improvements in exports of some countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, thanks to increased demand for high-technology goods in the global markets.",
        "Risks to the global economic recovery were largely unchanged from the previous assessment.",
        "Key risks included greater uncertainties in the aftermath of Brexit, especially over trade and investment negotiations between the UK and the EU that could take longer than expected and would depend largely on political developments in Europe.",
        "Moreover, the upcoming US presidential election and financial stability concerns in Europe and China continued to warrant close monitoring, as they could affect investors’ confidence and financial market volatility going forward.",
        "Volatility in the financial markets receded after the previous meeting as investors’ concerns over Brexit somewhat subsided.",
        "Meanwhile, additional monetary policy easing by major central banks prompted investors to increase holdings of emerging market assets, including those of Thailand.",
        "As a result, in August the baht appreciated against the US dollar, in the same direction with regional currencies.",
        "However, later in September the baht and regional currencies depreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar, as an increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year became more likely.",
        "Altogether, over the course of the inter-meeting period, the baht appreciated only slightly against the US dollar.",
        "Given the baht’s strength relative to major currencies and most regional currencies, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) appreciated somewhat, with periodic volatility due to movements of the Japanese yen.",
        "In the meantime, Thai government bond yields rose overall, while the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index declined due to selling pressure from domestic institutional investors despite net purchases by foreign investors.",
        "The Committee anticipated that major central banks would maintain very accommodative monetary policy for a longer period of time (‘low for longer’), which could amount to additional capital inflows into emerging markets including Thailand.",
        "However, uncertainty regarding the timing of, or policy measures to be used for, further monetary easing could contribute to capital flow and exchange rate volatility in the period ahead.",
        "Hence, the Committee would continue to monitor global financial market developments closely as they might impact the stability of Thailand’s financial markets going forward.",
        "The Thai economy recorded higher-than-expected growth in the second quarter on the back of a strong expansion in private consumption, partly as a result of temporary factors including the launches of new car models, promotional campaigns, and government stimulus measures during the holiday period.",
        "Meanwhile, public spending and tourism continued to be the key growth drivers.",
        "Nonetheless, merchandise exports and industrial production contracted due to the slowdown in Asian economies and structural problems facing the Thai economy.",
        "In this connection, private investment remained low and mostly concentrated in some business sectors—for instance, the service sector, especially hotel and retail sale businesses.",
        "In addition, subdued private investment contributed to the slowdown in credit expansion by commercial banks over the recent period.",
        "With these observations the Committee agreed that, while the ongoing economic recovery required accommodative monetary policy, reform policies to uplift Thailand’s productivity and competitiveness, especially in the export sector, would be more important.",
        "The Committee expected the Thai economy to grow at a slightly faster rate in 2016 than the previous assessment on account of better-than-expected private consumption outturn in the second quarter.",
        "Nonetheless, the economy was expected to slow down slightly in the latter half of the year.",
        "Growth momentum from private consumption showed signs of moderation, following the acceleration in the earlier period, due to already softened earnings in the manufacturing sector and fragile private confidence.",
        "In addition, the number of foreign tourists was expected to be more modest compared with the previous projection in light of the government’s attempt to curb zero-dollar tours.",
        "Consequently, the Committee revised the growth forecast for 2016 to 3.2 percent.",
        "Meanwhile, the Committee maintained the growth forecast for 2017 at 3.2 percent.",
        "Public investment was projected to increase further with the ongoing support from measures to accelerate government investment, which would help offset the contraction in exports and subdued private investment.",
        "Overall, the Committee projected that the Thai economy would continue to recover, but risks to growth remained tilted to the downside owing to both domestic and external factors, especially the more fragile global recovery following Brexit and political developments abroad.",
        "Furthermore, shifts in the global trade structure and structural limitations that affect Thailand’s competitiveness might cause some of Thailand’s export products to be unable to reap the full benefits of the global economic recovery in the period ahead.",
        "Headline inflation increased slightly in August on account of fresh food prices, while core inflation remained stable at low levels in line with the gradual recovery in demand.",
        "The Committee expected headline inflation to return to the target band within 2016 as previously assessed, with headline inflation averaging at 0.3 percent in 2016 due to this year’s low oil prices and 2.0 percent in 2017 thanks to the expected recovery of global oil prices as well as the base effect.",
        "Core inflation in 2016 and 2017 was projected to remain at 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively.",
        "Overall financial stability remained sound but certain pockets of risks warranted monitoring.",
        "These included the search-for-yield behavior under the prolonged low interest rate environment, especially household investment in higher-risk financial assets, and declining credit quality in some business sectors amid gradual economic recovery.",
        "The latter was particularly pertinent to small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which financial institutions remained cautious in extending credit to.",
        "The Committee judged that the policy rate should be kept on hold at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, the Thai economy continued to recover as expected although growth was still limited to some sectors, and the recovery still faced greater uncertainties on both domestic and external fronts.",
        "In addition, headline inflation was likely to return to the target band within the latter half of this year in line with the previous assessment.",
        "Monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery, as reflected in low real interest rates and bond yields, while the slowdown in credit expansion by commercial banks was in part attributed to demand-side factors.",
        "Nonetheless, the baht appreciated against key trading partner currencies which, in the Committee’s view, might not be beneficial to Thailand’s ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The Committee affirmed the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would be faced with greater uncertainties in the period ahead.",
        "These included, in particular, the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainty in the monetary policy directions of major advanced economies, which could significantly affect the recovery of Thailand’s trading partners and the continuity of Thailand’s growth momentum.",
        "The Committee thus viewed it essential to preserve policy space to cushion potential impact should these risks materialize.",
        "In addition, the Committee would continue to closely monitor financial stability risks, including the search-for-yield behavior and declines in credit quality.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "In the first quarter of 2016, the global economy recovered at a pace slightly slower than assessed in the previous meeting, as growth momentum in the G3 economies weakened in line with consumption spending.",
        "Going forward, however, the pace of the global economic recovery was still expected to remain close to the previous projection.",
        "Key support would come from continued improvements in the U.S. economy, given the ongoing recovery in the labor market, while both the manufacturing and services sectors were likely to resume positive trajectory.",
        "At the same time, the Japanese economy gained support from accommodative monetary policy, coupled with government spending on reconstruction projects following the earthquake which had affected manufacturing activities and private consumption in the earlier period.",
        "With regard to China, government measures led to some economic improvements in the near term, but elevated corporate debt and overcapacity in the industrial sector continued to pose downside risks to the longterm outlook.",
        "The balance of risks to the global economy remained tilted to the downside, given the risks surrounding China’s economy and financial markets as well as monetary policy divergence among advanced economies.",
        "In addition, uncertainty regarding the Brexit referendum results could add to global financial market volatility and weigh on the euro area recovery through trade and investment channels.",
        "The Committee would pay close attention to future developments of China’s corporate defaults and the effectiveness of policy responses from the Chinese authorities, since these issues could have implications on financial stability in China and regional countries.",
        "Overall confidence in the financial markets improved, as crude oil prices rebounded and investors’ concerns over the Chinese financial markets eased somewhat in the near term.",
        "With the anticipation of gradual policy rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve, investors continued to increase holdings of emerging market financial assets including those of Thailand.",
        "This resulted in an increase in Thai equity market indices and an appreciation of the baht against the U.S. dollar in line with regional currencies.",
        "The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), however, depreciated due to a rapid appreciation in the Japanese yen.",
        "Thai government bond yields, especially at the long end of the yield curve, continued to edge lower mainly due to strong demand from domestic investors, causing the yield curve to flatten substantially from the beginning of the year.",
        "This helped lower financing costs and made domestic monetary conditions more accommodative.",
        "Nevertheless, some Committee members expressed concerns regarding low global bond yields that could potentially reflect underpricing of risks.",
        "In addition, a possible snapback in global bond yields, which could raise Thai bond yields as well, could have adverse impacts on the corporate sector.",
        "These issues warranted close monitoring in the period ahead.",
        "Going forward, monetary policy divergence could still contribute to heightened volatility in international capital flows and exchange rates.",
        "However, Thailand’s strong external positions at present could help support investors’ confidence.",
        "The Thai economy continued to recover gradually, supported by effective disbursement of the fiscal budget as well as tourism that expanded more than anticipated on the back of a broad-based increase in the number of foreign visitors.",
        "Nevertheless, merchandise export volume, after excluding gold, still contracted from the same period last year due to the slowdown in trading partners’ economies and prevailing structural problems.",
        "Overall private investment remained low, with capacity expansion seen only in certain industries such as telecommunications and renewable electricity generation.",
        "Subdued investment caused imported capital goods and raw materials, together with commercial bank credit growth, to be on the decline.",
        "The modest credit growth was also due partly to the expiration of the government soft loan program.",
        "Private consumption showed signs of weakening partly because the drought had affected purchasing power of agricultural households.",
        "Meanwhile, non-farm employment was able to provide less cushion than in the past, as demand for labor in the manufacturing sector declined in line with the softening of economic activity.",
        "The Thai economy was estimated to expand in 2016 at a rate close to the assessment in the previous meeting.",
        "Tourism, projected to grow briskly, would compensate for the more- than-expected slowdown in private consumption and investment.",
        "In the period ahead, despite a return to normal rainfall pattern from mid-year onward, the Committee expected the impacts of drought on the financial health of agricultural households to persist for some time.",
        "One reason was the loss of income that caused some agricultural households to incur more debt.",
        "Another was a potential deterioration in soil fertility following severe dry season.",
        "Private consumption would thus continue to be weighed down going forward.",
        "Overall, risks to the recovery were judged to be skewed more to the downside compared with the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee would monitor domestic demand closely in order to ascertain the economic momentum amid the fragile global recovery.",
        "Headline inflation turned positive in April due to an increase in oil prices coupled with acceleration in fresh food prices.",
        "The latter was, nevertheless, considered to be a temporary result of the unusually hot weather.",
        "Meanwhile, demand-side inflationary pressure remained low, as reflected by subdued core inflation which was consistent with a gradual economic recovery.",
        "Going forward, the Committee projected headline inflation to gradually rise in line with the previous assessment, although the inflation outlook could be affected by uncertainties in global oil prices and softening domestic demand.",
        "Overall risks to financial stability rose slightly on the back of search-for-yield behavior and weakened debt service ability of both agricultural households and SMEs amid a delayed economic recovery.",
        "The deterioration in debt service ability was reflected by rising nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios, especially in the categories of SME loans and credit card loans.",
        "In addition, some Committee members noted that the currently low financing costs of large corporations, which resulted from banks competing for financially secured borrowers and a rapid increase in investors’ demand for private debenture, could reflect underpricing of risks.",
        "As such, the Committee would monitor and assess these developments closely.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee judged that the Thai economy would continue to expand at a rate close to the previous assessment but face greater downside risks on the domestic front.",
        "Moreover, the strengthening of the baht against some trading partner currencies during some recent periods might not be as conducive to the economic recovery as it could be.",
        "Nonetheless, overall monetary conditions eased further thanks to the low levels of bond yields and prior reduction in commercial bank lending rates, which were deemed conducive to overall economic recovery.",
        "Consequently, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting.",
        "The Committee also saw the need to preserve the policy space should the ongoing economic recovery become affected by negative risk factors such as a further delay in the global recovery, a prolonged weakness in domestic consumption, or political uncertainties that could dent public and private investments.",
        "Meanwhile, risks to financial stability from the search-foryield behavior, as well as other long-term imbalances that could accumulate under the prolonged low interest rate environment, continued to warrant close monitoring.",
        "In addition, some Committee members judged that monetary policy easing would provide limited support to the economy and inflation, as the current slowdown of the Thai economy was partly due to global and domestic structural problems.",
        "Besides, the reduction in commercial bank lending rates had already eased monetary conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while safeguarding financial stability.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies overall were projected to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment.",
        "The US economy continued to recover, consistent with improvements in the labor market.",
        "Moreover, prospects for additional fiscal stimulus under the new administration and the expected acceleration in inflation led market participants to anticipate a faster pace of increases in the federal funds rate than previously expected.",
        "Consequently, the recovery of China and other Asian economies might be negatively affected by a tightening of global financial conditions as well as uncertainties pertaining to US trade policies which would have significant implications for investor confidence and global trade going forward.",
        "Risks to global growth remained tilted to the downside.",
        "Upside risks increased slightly as additional fiscal stimulus in the US might boost imports from trading partners.",
        "Nonetheless, downside risks increased by a larger margin, especially those in connection with China’s real estate and financial sectors as well as European banks and political fragilities.",
        "In addition, some Committee members expressed concerns over the recent escalation of geopolitical risks.",
        "The Committee viewed the direction of US economic policies highly uncertain and saw the need to closely monitor and assess their potential impact on the Thai economy.",
        "While the fiscal stimulus in the US, especially if greater than anticipated, could reinforce the global economic recovery in the short run, it could be circumscribed by the debt ceiling.",
        "Meanwhile, the positive impact on global growth could be limited, as changes in the US investment and trade policies as well as the new administration’s stance on trade agreements might lead to reshoring of manufacturing activities back to the US, which might negatively affect production and exports of Asian economies in the period ahead.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets increased from the previous meeting.",
        "This was mainly attributed to changes in investors’ expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, uncertainties pertaining to the direction of US economic policies under the new administration, risks stemming from political developments in Europe, and financial stability issues in China that remained fragile.",
        "These factors led investors to reduce their holdings of emerging market assets, including those of Thailand.",
        "As a result, Thai government bond yields increased especially in longer tenures.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht depreciated against the US dollar in line with movements of regional currencies.",
        "However, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) appreciated from the last meeting, as the baht depreciated by less than overall trading partner currencies, partly due to investors’ confidence in Thailand’s external stability and the relatively low non-resident participation in the Thai bond market.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index increased, in contrast with regional markets, driven by improved sentiment resulting from the announcement of additional stimulus packages by the government.",
        "Moreover, the recent pickup in oil prices toward the end of November was a positive factor for energy stocks.",
        "The Committee anticipated that capital flow and exchange rate volatility would continue to increase in the period ahead as external uncertainties remained substantial.",
        "In addition, some Committee members viewed that US dollar liquidity in global financial markets might tighten as a result of capital outflows to the US.",
        "This could impact Thai financial markets and thus warranted monitoring going forward.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment, but with changes in growth composition.",
        "Merchandise exports improved due to the recent relocation of production capacity of certain products to Thailand.",
        "Private consumption expanded on the back of farm income and the government’s short-term stimulus packages.",
        "Public expenditure remained an important growth driver for the economy.",
        "However, tourism was affected more than expected by recent measures to curb illegal tour operators.",
        "Private investment remained low, with growth concentrated in certain business sectors consistent with the expansion of business credit extended by commercial banks.",
        "Growth projection for 2016 and 2017 remained largely unchanged from the previous forecast at 3.2 percent, as the negative impact on growth from tourism and private investment was offset by positive growth momentum from merchandise exports and private consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, infrastructure investment outlays and disbursement of funds under the government’s Pracharat projects were expected to have significant roles in driving the economy in the period ahead.",
        "However, risks to growth tilted more to the downside relative to the previous projection due to weaker-than-expected growth in trading partners, uncertainties in the direction of US trade policies that would have adverse implications for confidence and international trade, and the number of Chinese tourists that could turn out lower than projected.",
        "Headline inflation was expected to gradually rise and return to the target band in the first quarter of 2017, although the timing would depend largely on future developments in oil and fresh food prices.",
        "Core inflation remained stable at low levels around the previous assessment.",
        "Meanwhile, the public’s medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target.",
        "As inflationary pressure was expected to remain subdued, the headline inflation forecast for 2016 and 2017 was revised down to an average of 0.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the core inflation forecast for 2016 and The Committee assessed that financial stability remained sound and able to provide an effective cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts.",
        "However, there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring, including the deterioration of loan quality for businesses, particularly among small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and households.",
        "In addition, the search-for-yield behavior, especially in unrated bonds, would be closely monitored as it might lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "The Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, while the Thai economy remained on a recovery path with growth momentum largely unchanged from the previous meeting, there were greater downside risks stemming mainly from external factors.",
        "Inflation was expected to rise slowly.",
        "In addition, overall monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates.",
        "Despite increases in long-term government bond yields, their levels remained close to the averages in the previous year.",
        "Meanwhile, although the baht recently weakened against the US dollar, its depreciation was relatively small compared with overall trading partner currencies, which might not be as beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery as it could.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee viewed that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility.",
        "These factors could significantly impact the economic recovery of trading partners and Thailand’s exports.",
        "Hence, the Committee would monitor future developments of risks and their potential impacts on the Thai economy.",
        "Going forward, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative and would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "The Committee acknowledged the Cabinet’s approval on 20 December 2016 of the proposed monetary policy target for 2017, which was jointly agreed by the Committee and the Minister of Finance.",
        "The annual average of headline inflation at 2.5 ± 1.5 percent was set as the medium-term monetary policy target and the target for 2017, as it was deemed conducive to economic growth and price stability as well as the country’s competitiveness.",
        "Nonetheless, ongoing structural changes in the global and Thai economies might lead to lower global and domestic inflation trends going forward.",
        "Thus, the Committee would continue to closely monitor these developments in order to set a future monetary policy target that would be consistent with the evolving economic environment.",
        "The global economy expanded at a slower pace compared with the assessment in the previous meeting due mainly to weaker Asian economies, in particular China.",
        "A slowdown in China’s industrial production resulted in a decline in merchandise export growth of other Asian economies (excluding Japan) through strong manufacturing and trade linkages.",
        "In addition, some Asian economies faced negative domestic headwinds that led to weaker domestic demand.",
        "In contrast, the G3 economies continued to recover, supported by domestic consumption, improving labor market conditions, and accommodative monetary conditions.",
        "The Bank of Japan recently reduced the interest rate paid on commercial bank excess reserves to -0.1 percent given the low inflation in Japan together with concerns about repercussions from weakening Chinese and other emerging market economies.",
        "Meanwhile, the European Central Bank signaled that it might undertake additional monetary easing in order to lend support to the euro area recovery, and the Federal Reserve was expected to slow down the pace of monetary policy normalization on the back of a weaker economic and inflation outlook in the US.",
        "The Committee judged the balance of risks to the global economy tilted more to the downside given the risks surrounding China’s economy and financial markets, monetary policy divergence among advanced economies, subdued global commodity prices, and geopolitical risks.",
        "With regard to China, financial market and business sentiment would depend critically on policy certainty and clear communication by the authorities.",
        "Meanwhile, risks to financial stability in China that might arise from corporate defaults warranted close monitoring.",
        "The Committee would also pay close attention to the geopolitical risks that intensified since the previous meeting and could potentially affect the global economic recovery through trade, tourism, and investment channels.",
        "Global financial markets experienced heightened volatility since the beginning of 2016 on the back of fluctuations in China’s financial markets, declining oil prices, and monetary policy divergence among advanced economies.",
        "These factors caused volatile movements in capital flows and exchange rates, especially after the announcement of a negative interest rate policy by the Bank of Japan, together with an increasing prospect that the European Central Bank would undertake additional monetary easing.",
        "As a result, investors raised their holdings of emerging market assets, including Thailand, which contributed to increases in Thai equity indices and significant declines in government bond yields.",
        "Lower bond yields were also partly due to expectations of subdued inflation in Thailand following a further decline in oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the baht appreciated against the US dollar similar to other currencies in the region.",
        "However, the extent to which the baht appreciated outpaced most regional currencies, causing the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) to appreciate, which according to some Committee members might not be as conducive to Thailand’s economic recovery as it had been in the past.",
        "The Thai economy in the final quarter of 2015 grew at a pace largely in line with the assessment at the previous meeting.",
        "The recovery was supported by high disbursement of government funds, increasing number of tourists especially from China, and improving private consumption, the last of which was due partly to a temporary boost from the government’s year-end tax deduction measures and accelerated purchases of automobiles prior to the increase in vehicle excise tax rates to take effect in 2016.",
        "However, overall private investment remained subdued, while the total merchandise export values markedly contracted.",
        "Exports would likely continue to be held down by both a weak cyclical recovery in major trading partners’ demand and domestic structural constraints weighing on the country’s export competitiveness.",
        "Going forward, Thai exports, therefore, might receive rather limited benefits from a recovery in the global economy.",
        "The Committee judged that the Thai economy would likely grow in 2016 at a rate close to the projection at the previous meeting.",
        "The growth momentum would be largely driven by domestic demand — in particular, sustained public spending, private investment in some industries such as telecommunication, and household spending supported by falling oil prices despite lower farm incomes following declining commodity prices.",
        "Nevertheless, downside risks to growth were judged to increase, largely attributable to external factors including the prospect of economic recovery in major trading partners, changes in the global trade structure, subdued commodity prices, and monetary policy divergence in advanced economies.",
        "The Committee assessed that these increasing risks to global growth could weigh on Thai exports, and that warranted close monitoring.",
        "Inflationary pressures continued to subside since the previous meeting following a faster- and larger-than-expected decline in global oil prices, causing risks to inflation to skew further to the downside.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation rate, currently below zero, was projected to rise gradually and turn positive during the first half of 2016, although the inflation outlook would largely depend on the trajectory of oil prices.",
        "In any case, deflation risks remained limited as attested by a pickup in demand and positive core inflation, which reflected stable or rising prices of most non-energy goods, consistent with the public’s medium-term inflation expectations that stayed close to the inflation target.",
        "The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Under the Committee's assessment, the prevailing monetary policy stance remained accommodative and conducive to economic recovery, while the economic and inflation outlook did not change significantly from the previous meeting.",
        "The Committee was mindful of the risks to financial stability stemming particularly from the search for yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "The Committee also saw the need to preserve policy space should significant risks and uncertainty, especially from the external front, negatively affect economic recovery going forward.",
        "In addition, some members viewed that further monetary policy easing could only marginally improve the economic and inflation outlook given that the current policy stance was already accommodative.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should continue to remain sufficiently accommodative in order to facilitate economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would closely monitor global economic and financial market developments, together with domestic monetary conditions and exchange rate movements, and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to grow at a pace close to the previous assessment.",
        "The recovery of G3 economies, driven by private consumption, was projected to continue in line with improving manufacturing production and firm consumer confidence.",
        "Asian economies were expected to recover at a gradual pace, although private consumption in some economies softened as a result of rising unemployment and other country-specific factors.",
        "Meanwhile, Asian exports began to gain traction, gradually picking up from low levels.",
        "Risks to global growth in the period ahead tilted further to the downside mainly on account of uncertainties stemming from political developments in the US and Europe.",
        "The US presidential election result and new economic policies might affect international trade and confidence of the private sector.",
        "Meanwhile, trade and investment negotiations between the UK and the EU in the aftermath of Brexit might result in limitations on market access and labor movement, both of which could impede the economic recovery in the UK and European economies more than previously expected.",
        "In addition, concerns over the European and the Chinese financial sectors continued to warrant close monitoring going forward.",
        "The Committee assessed that the fragile global economic recovery was partly attributed to ongoing structural changes such as the increased roles of the service sector and the development of new production technology that reduced the need for large-scale investments in fixed assets.",
        "In addition, amid the highly uncertain global economic environment, businesses tended to push back their investment.",
        "These factors contributed to the widened saving-investment gap and might lead to lower potential growth for the global economy in the long run.",
        "Hence, the Committee would continue to monitor such developments closely.",
        "Volatility in the global financial market increased compared with the previous meeting, while volatility in the Thai financial market heightened temporarily from domestic factors.",
        "Financial market volatility was driven mainly by investors’ concerns over the result of the US presidential election.",
        "Meanwhile, the prospect of interest rate normalization by the Federal Reserve became clearer following releases of better-than-expected US economic data, which led investors to reduce their holdings of emerging market assets including those of Thailand.",
        "As a result, the baht depreciated against the US dollar and underwent a period of volatile movements in October due to domestic factors.",
        "However, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) appreciated somewhat, mainly on account of the baht’s strength against major currencies other than the US dollar.",
        "In the meantime, developments in domestic equity and bond markets were largely in line with regional markets but with periodic volatility stemming from domestic factors.",
        "Thai government bond yields increased slightly compared with the previous meeting as a result of selling pressure by foreign investors.",
        "The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index increased on account of net purchases by local investors.",
        "The Committee anticipated that capital flow and exchange rate volatility would likely increase in the period ahead due to external uncertainties.",
        "These would include, in particular, uncertainties in the direction of the US economic policies under the new administration, together with the timing of, or policy measures to be used for, further monetary easing by central banks in major advanced economies.",
        "In addition, the Committee was more concerned with persistently low global bond yields, possibly reflecting underpricing of risks, that would be prone to snapback should developments in financial markets deviate from investors’ expectations.",
        "Such snapbacks in global bond yields could spill over to Thai bond yields.",
        "The Thai economy was projected to recover at a pace close to the previous assessment.",
        "Exports of manufacturing goods expanded more than expected, partly due to special factors such as the consolidation of production location of certain products to Thailand and an increase in demand for some of Thailand’s export goods.",
        "At the same time, tourism was expected to slow down as a result of the government’s measure to curb zero-dollar tours, which impacted both the service providers in the tourism supply chain and the foreign demand for tourism in Thailand.",
        "Private consumption continued to expand thanks to the government’s subsidies granted to some agricultural households, a rising wage trend in tandem with the expected increase in the minimum wages next year, and oil prices which remained low.",
        "However, some activities, especially those related to services, might slow down temporarily.",
        "Public expenditure continued to be an important growth driver.",
        "While private investment remained low, there were some improvements in certain export- oriented manufacturing sectors that were consistent with fund raising by businesses in the manufacturing sector which showed signs of improvement.",
        "Under the Committee’s assessment, the Thai economy remained on a recovery path, but risks to growth titled further to the downside.",
        "Increased risks to the global economic recovery might affect Thai exports of goods.",
        "At the same time, domestic risk factors, particularly the possible impact of the measures to curb zero-dollar tours, might cause the number of Chinese tourists to turn out lower than the previous projection.",
        "Headline inflation softened slightly on account of fresh food prices, while core inflation remained stable close to the previous assessment.",
        "The Committee expected that headline inflation would rise slowly and might return to the target later than previously projected, depending on fresh food prices and the largely uncertain developments in global oil prices.",
        "Nevertheless, headline inflation was still expected to gradually pick up, while the public’s medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the inflation target.",
        "The Committee assessed that overall financial stability remained sound and able to provide cushion against potential shocks and volatilities in financial markets.",
        "However, there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring, including the deterioration of loan quality for businesses, particularly among small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and households.",
        "In addition, the search for yield, especially in unrated bonds, would be closely monitored because if investors do not have sufficient understanding of investment risks, it might lead to underpricing of risks and accumulation of financial fragilities going forward.",
        "The Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Under their assessment, the Thai economy continued to expand at a rate close to the previous assessment despite increased downside risks from both domestic and external factors.",
        "In addition, inflation was expected to increase but might return to the target later than expected mainly due to supply-side factors.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery as reflected in low real interest rates and government bond yields.",
        "Nonetheless, the baht’s appreciation against key trading partner currencies in some recent periods might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The Committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility.",
        "These factors could significantly affect the recovery of Thailand’s trading partners and the continuity of Thailand’s growth momentum.",
        "The Committee thus viewed it essential to preserve the policy space to cushion potential impact should these risks materialize.",
        "In addition, the Committee assessed that, although financial stability remained sound, more pockets of risks warranted close monitoring, particularly the deterioration in loan quality and the search-foryield behavior under the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability.",
        "Thailand’s trading partner economies were projected to recover at a slower pace than assessed in the previous meeting.",
        "This was mainly due to the result of the British referendum (Brexit) that negatively impacted confidence in and stability of global financial markets and consequently economic activities going forward.",
        "European economies, in particular, would be directly affected by Brexit through trade linkages and weakened private sector confidence.",
        "Meanwhile, the recovery of the US economy might be moderated by the recent appreciation of the US dollar, which led to market expectations that the Federal Reserve would postpone further hikes in the federal funds rate.",
        "At the same time, the Bank of Japan might ease monetary policy further to lend additional support to the slowing Japanese economy, which was in part a result of the appreciation of the yen that could affect profitability and repatriation of profits of Japanese businesses overseas.",
        "Overall, the slower recovery of G3 economies, combined with more fragile investor confidence from uncertainties in the global economy, contributed to a slower growth outlook for China and other Asian economies compared with the previous assessment.",
        "Risks to the global economic recovery increased.",
        "The Committee assessed that, while Brexit might not have much impact on the global economic recovery in the short run, uncertainties in the aftermath of Brexit, especially over trade and investment negotiations between the UK and the EU, would have significant implications on international trade and global growth in the long run.",
        "Furthermore, concerns over the European financial sector warranted close monitoring, as it could impact financial stability in Europe and consequently Asia through financial market volatility and liquidity.",
        "Financial stability risks in China, especially those pertaining to real estate prices and shadow banking, also warranted continued monitoring.",
        "In addition, political developments, such as the future stability of the EU and the US presidential election, could affect confidence and the economic outlook of Thailand’s trading partners going forward.",
        "Volatility in financial markets heightened after the June meeting in light of Brexit.",
        "Subsequently, investors increased holdings of safe-haven assets, which contributed to the US dollar’s strength, higher gold prices, and declines in government bond yields of major advanced economies.",
        "During the run-up to the August meeting, however, market concerns over Brexit eased, but there remained expectations that major central banks would maintain very accommodative monetary policy for longer than previously expected (‘low for longer’).",
        "This led to increased capital flows into emerging markets including Thailand.",
        "As a result, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index picked up.",
        "Meanwhile, the Thai baht appreciated against the US dollar, moving in the same direction as other regional currencies.",
        "As the baht strengthened against certain major currencies and in some periods appreciated by more than other regional currencies, the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) rose.",
        "Thai government bond yields, on the contrary, were largely unchanged as the increase in foreign demand was offset by additional issuance.",
        "The Committee expected capital flow and exchange rate volatility to persist in the period ahead.",
        "Major contributing factors included monetary policy uncertainties in major advanced economies, which could have broad-based impacts on emerging market economies including Thailand, and fragile sentiment in global financial markets under the low-forlonger environment.",
        "The Thai economy continued to recover at a gradual pace, mainly driven by effective disbursement of the fiscal budget as expected and a steady expansion in the tourism sector.",
        "Private consumption increased on the back of improvements in income and confidence of agricultural households after the drought subsided.",
        "However, merchandise exports continued to contract on account of weak demand from Asian economies, shifting global trade structure, and declining competitiveness in some product categories.",
        "As such, there was excess production capacity in the manufacturing sector, and hence overall private investment remained low despite some expansion in certain business sectors.",
        "This was consistent with total corporate financing that continued to expand but at a lower rate compared with the historical average and was still highly concentrated in larger firms.",
        "Furthermore, some businesses still faced limitations in obtaining credits partly due to cautious lending by financial institutions against the current backdrop of gradual economic recovery.",
        "The Committee projected the Thai economy to expand at a rate close to the previous assessment but with greater downside risks from increased uncertainties in the global economy.",
        "As a result, tourism, a major growth driver, could be softer than expected, and merchandise exports could contract further.",
        "In addition, the Committee viewed that the extended period of subdued exports could negatively affect employment in some industries, while the ability of the service sector and other industries to provide employment cushion might be more limited should the economic recovery be slower than expected.",
        "This posed rising concerns over income growth and the strength of private consumption, particularly for non-agricultural households.",
        "Hence, the Committee would closely monitor employment conditions in the period ahead.",
        "Core inflation in July remained stable from the previous month, reflecting a subdued demand-pull inflationary pressure.",
        "Headline inflation softened slightly on account of fresh food prices, but continued to be on an upward trajectory towards the target band in line with the gradual economic recovery.",
        "Nonetheless, the timing of the return to the target band, which would depend mainly on global oil price movements, could be slightly pushed back from the previous assessment due to weaker-than-expected energy prices.",
        "Overall financial stability was not deemed to be a concern.",
        "However, risks arising from the prolonged low interest rate environment continued to warrant close monitoring, particularly the search for yield in unrated bonds that could lead to underpricing of risks.",
        "In addition, there remained signs of weakened debt serviceability among SMEs and households, as reflected in rising non-performing loan (NPL) ratios over recent periods.",
        "In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the economy continued to expand at a rate close to the previous projection, despite facing greater downside risks in the period ahead.",
        "Headline inflation was still projected to return to the target band.",
        "Meanwhile, monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery, as reflected in low real interest rates and a continued expansion in total corporate financing and household credits, although certain businesses faced limitations in obtaining credits.",
        "Hence, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.50 percent at this meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, the recent appreciation of the baht might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The Committee would therefore continue to closely monitor developments in the global economy as well as the exchange rate and monetary conditions in Thailand.",
        "The Committee affirmed the need to preserve policy space given considerable external uncertainties, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the monetary policy directions of major advanced economies.",
        "While these factors were unlikely to have discernible impact on the Thai economy in the short run, they could significantly hinder the recovery of Thailand’s trading partner economies and consequently the Thai economy in the period ahead.",
        "As such, the Committee viewed it essential to preserve policy space to cushion potential impact should these risks materialize.",
        "In addition, most Committee members viewed that monetary policy decisions should give due consideration to a potential increase in risk accumulation due to the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment.",
        "Looking ahead, the Committee concurred that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The Committee would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery and ensure financial stability."
