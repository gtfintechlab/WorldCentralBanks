        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained and the economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing, while economic growth in some emerging market countries continued to deteriorate affected mainly by export sluggishness and capital outflows.",
        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, due largely to continuation of the U.S. economic recovery, but forecast that factors such as the possibility of slower economic growth in emerging market countries including natural resource exporters, and changes in global financial market conditions would act as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members mentioned that the international financial markets had shown a somewhat unstable appearance, with for example the volatilities of price variables including stock prices, interest rates and exchange rates rising and a concentration of global investment funds at the short-term end of the market, in line with the growing possibility of QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that it was maintaining its modest growth, as domestic demand such as for consumption and investment had increased and as exports showed buoyancy, helped chiefly by the Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "taken by the government.",
        "As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap would steadily narrow, assisted largely by gradual improvements in external conditions.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that, after having declined under the influence of the movements of major country government bond yields, long-term market interest rates had risen with the improvements in economic indicators, causing the spread between long- and short-term rates to widen.",
        "They went on to note that stock prices had fallen again, after having risen due mainly to increases in global stock prices and to inflows of foreign capital, while the Korean won had appreciated slightly.",
        "Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained a low level in the lower- to mid-1% range, affected largely by low demand-side pressures and by factors on the supply side.",
        "Many members forecast that, despite increases in international oil prices, consumer price inflation would remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as with prices sustaining their low upward trend the domestic economy appeared to be improving, albeit moderately.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that there was a need to analyze the influence of QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve on the Korean economy from various perspectives, and to closely monitor the related developments.",
        "He noted in particular that special attention should be paid to the possibility of greatly increased exchange rate and capital flow volatility in the future, caused by the differences in timings of major countries’ exit strategies.",
        "Another member pointed out the need to prepare against the possibilities of either foreign capital in- or outflows occurring, by expanding the remit of the market stabilization measures that had been established based on the assumption that there would be a sharp rise in the Korean won/U.S.",
        "dollar exchange rate and sudden foreign capital outflows at times of external shock occurrence.",
        "He went on to comment that attention should also be paid to measures for utilizing the foreign capital that was entering in a way so as to help the expansion of Korea’s economic growth potential.",
        "Another member noted that, in view of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of the Korean economy, such as the excessive household debt level and low corporate profitability, as a precaution against further expansions of financial unrest in emerging market countries there was a need to thoroughly prepare measures in advance for responding to any sudden reversal of foreign capital flows.",
        "One member in addition asserted that, while establishing a risk management system related to domestic risk factors, in order to mitigate financial uncertainties caused by the spread of external shocks and to prevent financial contagion, the early warning system should be strengthened so that it could identify vulnerabilities of the economy in advance and thus be utilized effectively and appropriately in the policy decision-making process.",
        "Another member expressed the view finally that, while keeping a close eye on the effects of the government’s measures to stabilize the leasehold deposit and monthly rent markets, and on the influence of the increases in leasehold–deposit prices on the real economy and financial markets, it was necessary to examine whether there were institutional or structural factors compounding the household debt problems.",
        "Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by the members: today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that the moderate economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that economic activities in the euro area appear to be emerging from their sluggishness to some degree, but that trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, helped primarily by improvements in the US economy, but judges that the uncertainties surrounding the scale of QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries, the financial instability in some emerging economies, and the geopolitical risk in the Middle East remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "to be continuing, with exports and consumption improving.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation declined slightly to 1.3% in August, from agricultural and petroleum products also fell slightly to 1.3% from the time being despite an increase in international oil prices, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices.",
        "As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their downtrend while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country slowed.",
        "The increase in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas meanwhile accelerated, and the uptrend in these prices in the rest of the country continued.",
        "in the international financial markets and the instabilities in the financial and foreign exchange markets of some emerging economies, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated, due mainly to the net inflows of foreigners’ stock investment funds.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range.",
        "the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of modest economic recovery in the US had been maintained despite the temporary slowdowns in improvement of some economic indicators, and that major sentiment indicators in the euro area had been showing trends of improvement.",
        "They also assessed that, although the pace of economic growth had slowed in some emerging market countries, China was showing signs of recovery, led by consumption and investment.",
        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its recovery going forward, centering around advanced countries, but forecast that factors such as the possibility of changes in global financial market conditions in line with QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and fiscal uncertainties in major countries would act as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, global interest rates had fallen and then rebounded, and after rising substantially stock prices had undergone a correction, in response for example to the reaching of agreement in the US budget negotiations and to changes in expectations related to QE tapering.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ assessment was that it was maintaining its recovery, with exports and the current account surplus reaching record highs and the employment situation showing favorable movements, despite the temporary sluggishness of real economic indicators in September due to exceptional factors.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that, although the domestic economy seemed likely to maintain its trend of steady recovery, due mainly to improvements in the global economy, the negative output gap would continue for the time being, owing to the sluggish pace of the global economic recovery and to potential uncertainties related for example to the revival of investment.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had risen substantially and the Korean won had remained strong, as a result of continued inflows of foreigners’ stock investment funds in response mainly to the reaching of agreement in the US fiscal negotiations and to expectations of a delay in QE tapering.",
        "Most members mentioned that the low inflation had been continuing for a considerable period of time, with the increase in the CPI running below agricultural and petroleum products.",
        "Many members forecast that, despite the factors pushing prices up such as hikes in public utility charges, consumer price inflation would remain low for the time being due mainly to low demand-side pressures and to institutional factors including free childcare provision.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period as, with inflation remaining at a low level, the domestic economy was maintaining its steady trend of recovery.",
        "One member expressed the opinion, considering the strong likelihood of structural changes having occurred in the domestic real economy and financial market environments, as the aftereffects of the global financial crisis were being prolonged, that it was necessary to examine whether there might be any problems in the current operational framework of monetary policy.",
        "Another member assessed that, although the Korean economy was sustaining its trend of recovery, it would be difficult to see it as having entered a full-fledged growth phase, and advocated the necessity of policy alternatives to revitalize facilities investment, which was showing an extremely lackluster picture in comparison particularly to its long-term trend.",
        "One other member noted that the monitoring of foreign exchange market movements such as foreign capital flows and exchange rate volatility due to changes in major countries’ monetary policies should be strengthened further, and that attention should be paid to factors disturbing the financial system, such as the possibility of a worsening of funding conditions in fragile economic sectors and the household debt situation.",
        "He then went on to argue that, with inflation running at a low level, policy credibility should be improved by strengthening communication concerning the operational target of inflation targeting.",
        "One member pointed out in addition that the endogenous resilience of private consumption and private investment in the Korean economy had weakened greatly compared to in the past, and mentioned that policy should focus on broadening the basis for household incomes by the creation of new jobs through the facilitation of private investment and the setting-up of an employment-friendly system, and going further on encouraging the balanced growth of domestic demand and exports.",
        "Finally, another member expressed the opinion that attention should be paid to the possibility of a spreading of systemic risk in line with the rise in leasehold deposit prices and the rapid increase in leasehold deposit fund loans, since qualitative changes were expected in the pattern of income redistribution between landlords and tenants, and in the quality of financial institutions’ loan assets, as the dramatic growth in leasehold deposit fund loans was causing real LTV ratios for leasehold housing to rise and the financial burdens of house owners were being shifted onto their tenants.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members: today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been maintained despite the temporary slowdowns in improvement of some economic indicators, and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, albeit weakly, while the trends of economic growth in emerging market countries, above all China, have continued to show signs of recovering.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued uncertainties surrounding the US government’s budget bill and the increase in its debt ceiling pose downside risks to growth.",
        "temporarily, but as exports have sustained their buoyancy the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow.",
        "to 0.7% in October, due mainly to expansions in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, but core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was 1.6% as in the previous month.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices.",
        "As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas turned upward while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country increased slightly.",
        "Leasehold-deposit prices sustained their high rate of increase of the previous month in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and their uptrend in the rest of the country accelerated.",
        "the reaching of agreement in the US fiscal negotiations and to changes in the expectations of a delay in QE tapering.",
        "Stock prices have fallen again, after having risen substantially, in line with shifts in the flows of foreigners’ stock investment funds, and the Korean won has depreciated recently, after having sustained a trend of appreciation due to continuation of the current account surplus.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have risen, after fluctuating within a narrow range.",
        "□ Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that, while the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained, the economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing and the modest recovery in Japan had been maintained, bolstered by an expansion in domestic demand, economic growth in some emerging market countries had slowed, influenced in part by financial instability.",
        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its recovery going forward, centering around advanced countries, but forecast that factors such as the heightening of uncertainties surrounding the US government budget bill and debt ceiling increase, fiscal uncertainties in major countries, and the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve would act as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, long-term interest rates in major countries had fallen substantially and stock prices had risen, while the US dollar had shifted to a trend of depreciation and the financial instability in some emerging market countries had eased temporarily, as the US Federal Reserve, contrary to market expectations, had decided to keep the amount of its asset purchases unchanged.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that it had been sustaining its modest pace of growth of late, as domestic demand such as English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "for consumption and investment had increased and as exports showed buoyancy, helped chiefly by the Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures taken by the government.",
        "As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap would steadily narrow, owing for example to the gradual improvements in external conditions.",
        "Members pointed out that the domestic financial markets had shown stable movements, with stock prices rising sharply as foreigners’ domestic stock investment had expanded significantly, while interest rates had fallen and the Korean won had appreciated slightly.",
        "Most members mentioned that consumer price inflation stood at a low level of below 1%, affected largely by decreases in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products.",
        "Many members forecast that consumer price inflation would remain low for the time being going forward, due to demand-side inflationary pressures being mild given the sluggish aggregate demand, on top of the exceptional price stability of supply-side factors and institutional factors related to social welfare.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as, with prices sustaining their low upward trend, the domestic economy appeared to be improving, albeit moderately.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that, although the continuous current account surplus could be seen from the microeconomic perspective as a result of the enhanced global competitiveness of Korean goods and services, attention should be directed from the macroeconomic perspective to the question of whether it implied that there was a big change taking place in the composition of expenditure by economic sector.",
        "Another member took the view that it was necessary to strengthen the monitoring of in- and outflows of short-term speculative capital, of the series of failures of large corporations, and of the possibility of a credit crunch in the corporate bond and CP markets, in order to prevent them from acting as factors destabilizing the domestic financial markets.",
        "Another member pointed out that, taking into account the high degree of openness of the Korean financial markets and their asymmetric characteristics, it would be necessary to move away from reliance on foreign reserve accumulation or macro-prudential regulations in the foreign exchange sector and to devise multifaceted measures for achieving foreign exchange market stabilization.",
        "In addition, one member mentioned that it would be necessary to closely examine the trends of early warning indicators such as the ratio of domestic credit and liabilities to GDP and the debt service ratio, and, while encouraging leverage adjustments in each economic sector, to strive constantly to improve the domestic economic fundamentals in the medium and long term through restructuring.",
        "Finally, another member pointed out that the current low inflation should be seen as disinflation, a slight slowing down in the rate of inflation, rather than as deflation, a declining in the level of prices itself, and expressed the view that undertaking an overall review of consumer price inflation, inflation expectations and the inflation target range, and, if necessary, establishing an inflation targeting regime appropriate to the new economic situation and circumstances were very important tasks.",
        "Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by the members: today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that the economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to be easing, while the trends of economic growth in emerging market countries, above all China, have shown signs of recovery to some extent.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, the members’ assessment was that, the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area had continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China had slowed somewhat.",
        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, due mainly to improvements in the US economy, but judged that factors such as the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stances and fiscal consolidations in major countries including the US, and the possibilities of slower economic growth in China would remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members mentioned that, in the international financial markets, with global interest rates showing stable trends due to the easing of concerns about early QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices had risen sharply.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed domestic demand such as for consumption and investment to be increasing, helped by the Base Rate cut and the stimulus measures taken by the government, with exports also showing buoyancy centering around those to the US and China.",
        "As for the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap would narrow steadily, as the domestic economy sustained its English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "modest recovery due mainly to the gradual improvements in external conditions and to continuation of the government policy effects.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that, after having declined under the influence of the movements of major country government bond yields, long-term market interest rates had risen with the improvements in economic indicators, causing the spread between long- and short-term rates to widen.",
        "They went on to note that stock prices had fallen again, after having risen due mainly to increases in global stock prices and to foreign capital inflows, while the Korean won had appreciated slightly.",
        "Many members mentioned that, although consumer price inflation had risen compared to the previous month, with the reversals to increase in the prices of agricultural and livestock products and petroleum products, it still maintained a low level of around 1%.",
        "Many members forecast that, although inflation would be higher than its current level, due mainly to imbalances in supply and demand for agricultural products resulting from the bad weather conditions and to a base effect from its low rate of increase in the second half of 2012, it would show a stable trend for the time being as the output gap remained negative.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as with prices stabilized the domestic economy was forecast to sustain its trend of recovery, albeit moderate, due mainly to the gradual recovery of the global economy.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that, given the ongoing concerns about QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the occurrences of foreign capital outflows from some emerging market countries, it would be desirable to review the effectiveness of the measures for mitigating capital flow volatility carried out to that point.",
        "Another member commented that, with the recent expansion in size of the domestic bond market and the growing influence of foreign investors, the possibility was rising of shocks to the Korean economy caused by changes in long-term market interest rates owing to external shocks related for example to the question of US exit strategy implementation, and that effective policy measures in response should therefore be sought.",
        "Another member pointed out that, while bearing in mind the phenomenon of microeconomic shocks affecting the macroeconomy as shocks to certain industries transformed into shocks to macroeconomic variables through the interconnected structure of the economy, it was necessary for macroprudential policy to be conducted in harmony with monetary and credit policy to ensure that financial sector procyclicality did not expand through the linkages between input and output.",
        "In addition, one member noted that the volume of foreign investment in the domestic bond market had recently soared to a level more than 13 percent higher than at the beginning of the year, and asserted the need for devising preemptive measures to stabilize the inflows of short-term speculative funds so as to minimize the harmful consequences of excessive in- and outflows of investment funds of foreigners.",
        "Finally, another member expressed the view that it was necessary for the Bank of Korea, as the central bank, to analyze the path through which household debt could return to an appropriate level that would not pose a burden to the macroeconomy and the financial system, and contribute thereby to improving the effectiveness of the measures being carried out by the government to achieve a soft-landing of the household debt problem.",
        "Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by the members: today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",

        "previous month, as the prices of agricultural and livestock products as well as petroleum products turned upward, and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products increased slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% in June.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will show a stable trend for the time being as the output gap remains negative, although it will rise above its present level due mainly to imbalances in agricultural product supply and demand caused by bad weather and to a base effect from its low rate of increase in the second half of last year.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas sustained their downtrend, while those in the rest of the country continued their uptrend.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery in the US had been sustained, and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appeared to be easing, with major sentiment indicators continually improving.",
        "Members also appraised economic growth trends in emerging market countries, above all China, to have been maintained.",
        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its recovery going forward, centering around advanced countries, but forecast that factors such as the possibility of changes in global financial market conditions in line with QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued US fiscal uncertainties, would act as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, while global interest rates were rising, due mainly to improvements in economic indicators in advanced countries and to the expectations of early tapering by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices had risen, centering around advanced countries, although in some weak emerging market countries they had fallen in response to outflows of foreign investment funds.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ assessment was that it was maintaining its trend of recovery, as the current account had registered a huge surplus in November while the exceptional factors seen in the previous month had disappeared and real indicators related to English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "production and domestic demand were showing buoyancy.",
        "As to the future outlook, many members anticipated that the trend of domestic economic recovery would be moderate, as the pace of the global economic recovery was sluggish while destabilizing factors remained, including the intensification of the trend of Japanese yen weakening and the possibility of increases in financial and FX market volatility.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had fallen and interest rates had risen, amid foreigners’ securities investment funds having flowed out on concerns about QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and that the Korean won had appreciated in line mainly with the current account surplus.",
        "Many members' judged that, with consumer price inflation maintaining its low level of around the 0% for the third consecutive month, due mainly to declines in agricultural product prices, there was an increased possibility of the low inflation lasting longer than expected if the stable trend of supply-side factors and the slow recovery of demand-side factors were to persist.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period, judging that the recent paths of growth and prices were not greatly different from those forecast in October, with prices maintaining their low upward trend and the domestic economy continuing its steady trend of recovery.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that the effects of monetary and fiscal policies should be examined so as to ensure that the trend of low growth and low inflation did not become permanent, while monitoring should be strengthened of foreign exchange market movements such as in and outflows of foreign currency funds and exchange rate volatility caused by changes in major countries’ monetary policies.",
        "He added that attention should be paid to factors disturbing the financial system, including the possibility of deterioration in fund-raising conditions for vulnerable sectors and the household debt situation.",
        "Another member commented that medium- and long-term interest rates were rising sharply, given the increasing expectations that the US Fed would implement its exit strategy before long due mainly to the improvement in US employment conditions.",
        "This rise in interest rates might, he added, significantly worsen the debt servicing burdens of households and businesses, and so a further strengthening was called for of efforts to stabilize market interest rates and prevent an excessive rate of growth in household lending exceeding the nominal GDP growth rate.",
        "One other member asserted that, in order to keep the foreign exchange and financial markets stable and minimize the negative effects of the weakening yen, attention should be paid to preventing any excessive increases in exchange rate volatility.",
        "And to achieve this, he further stressed the importance of developing a buffer system, for example through the diversification of settlement currencies.",
        "One member presented the view in addition that attention should be paid to the facts that the share in overall bank lending of loans to SMEs had been decreasing since the financial crisis and, furthermore, that the share of credit-based loans in total bank lending to SMEs had also continued to decline.",

        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in emerging market countries, above all China, have been maintained.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued US fiscal uncertainties remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "continuing in line with the trend of growth, as domestic demand and exports have both increased.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow.",
        "the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, increases in the prices of some industrial goods and the hike in electricity charges.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose from 1.6% to 1.8%.",
        "The Committee forecasts that, due largely to the stability of international agricultural prices, inflation will remain low for the time being, but that it will be higher than its current level.",
        "As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country increased slightly.",
        "The rise in leasehold-deposit prices slowed in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while the uptrend in the rest of the country kept to its pace of the previous month.",
        "substantially and long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by expectations of the US Federal Reserve’s QE tapering.",
        "The Korean won has strengthened while fluctuating in line with the influences of the continued current account surplus and outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds.",
        "the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on the 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment was that, despite the continued sluggishness of the euro area economy, the global economy was maintaining its modest recovery on the strength of improvements in the U.S. and Chinese economies.",
        "Many members mentioned that, notwithstanding the U.S. sequester and the euro area fiscal crisis the international financial markets were sustaining favorable trends, owing mainly to the continued quantitative easing policies of major economies.",
        "Members assessed that the domestic economy appeared to be pulling out of last year’s sluggishness, with the rate of economic growth in the first quarter estimated as slightly higher than that in the previous quarter, despite the low level of increase in exports and less-than-expected consumption level due mainly to expiry of the cut in the individual consumption tax.",
        "Concerning the outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap in the domestic economy would gradually narrow as both exports and domestic demand sustained their trends of recovery, boosted chiefly by the improvement in the global economy and by the easing of political and economic uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "A few members however remarked that the possibility was strong of a slower-than-expected pace of economic recovery, as improvements in private consumption and facilities investment were delayed under the influence for example of the Korea’s website slowdown in recovery of the global economy and the weakening of the Japanese yen.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that, under the combined effect of inflows of foreigners’ portfolio funds, the movements of the yen exchange rate and geopolitical risk, stock prices had fallen while the KRW/USD exchange rate had risen.",
        "Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained its low level at around the 1% range, due in large part to declines in agricultural, livestock and marine product prices and to the stabilization of international oil prices.",
        "Many members forecast that, although inflation would remain low for the time being - owing mainly to the easing of demand-side pressures – it would accelerate in the second half of this year with agricultural product prices and high inflation expectations working as driving factors.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members shared the opinion that, given that the effect of the Base Rate cuts in the second half of last year had not yet been fully reflected in the real economy, and considering the strong possibility of the domestic economy maintaining its moderate trend of recovery in line with the originally forecast growth path, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while closely monitoring changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad.",
        "One of these members pointed out that, while the Base Rate should be maintained at its current level to prepare effectively against the upside and downside tail risks, it was desirable to respond to the pace of economic recovery, which was considered to be somewhat sluggish, with a credit policy that could be customized to support vulnerable sectors.",
        "One other member was of the opinion that, although liquidity conditions in the Korean economy were accommodative given activities in the real economy, there was a problem in that this abundant liquidity had failed to link with business investment, and it was thus necessary to work to restore the monetary policy transmission channels and enhance the capability of monetary policy to respond to economic conditions.",
        "Other members however expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points, in order to support a recovery of the Korean economy’s growth trend and to pursue financial market stability, considering the relatively stable trend of inflation amid the heightened risks of a real economic contraction and of financial market instability.",
        "One of these members put forward the view that, although the stimulative effect of monetary policy was limited, the lowering of the Base Rate at this point might contribute greatly to strengthening the weakened resilience of the economy, to the improvement of economic agents’ sentiment, and to mitigation of the negative effects of major countries’ quantitative easing policies.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their discussions, the members compiled a statement that reflected the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Ha, Seong Keun, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang, and Mr. Chung, Soon Won expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point cut.",

        "and investment-related indicators have rebounded, the Committee appraises economic growth to have sustained its weak level, as consumption has continued its decline of the previous month.",
        "On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group.",
        "Going forward, there is no change to the Committee’s forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy and to the influence of Japanese yen weakening.",

        "Inflation appears likely to remain relatively low, due to the weakening of demand-side pressures.",
        "However, the Committee forecasts that it will rise above its current level in line with the partial disappearance of downward pressures from institutional factors.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their moderate uptrend.",
        "the Korean won has depreciated significantly against the US dollar, as foreigners’ securities investment funds have flowed out in line with the reemergence of euro area risk and with the increase in geopolitical risk in Korea.",

        "Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing its weak pace of growth, despite increasing exports, with domestic demand-related indicators alternating between improvement and worsening.",
        "Concerning the outlook, many members anticipated that, while the Korean economy would show improvement, due in large part to the global economic recovery amid improving consumer and investor sentiment, the pace of this improvement would be slow.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had fallen while the KRW/USD rate had risen, due mostly to concerns about possible deteriorations in performance of some exporters owing to the weakness of the Japanese yen, amid the emergence of North-Korea related geopolitical risks.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Consumer price inflation had been recorded around the 1% level, owing to the stability of domestic petroleum product prices and despite agricultural product price instability due to cold spells and hikes in some public utility charges.",
        "Many members judged that, despite concerns about the rise in international oil prices, and imbalances between agricultural product supply and demand, inflation would remain low for the time being due for example to the easing of demand-side pressures.",
        "With regard to real estate prices, one member observed that housing prices were continuing their downtrend and housing leasehold deposit prices their uptrend, due mainly to the continuing economic uncertainties and the spread of expectations of housing price declines.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: While major real economic indicators had improved amid sustained price stability, employment had slowed and consumption had been somewhat weak.",
        "Uncertainties concerning economic conditions remained, due mainly to the negotiations on the U.S. sequester and the delay in recovery of the European economy on the international front, and to sluggish consumption and exchange rate fluctuations domestically.",
        "The government planned to continue its policy measures to enhance economic dynamism, while closely monitoring domestic and international economic developments and strengthening its monitoring of financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, although the trend of growth in domestic economic activity remained weak and prices were stable, given that the domestic economy was moving in the direction of recovery, albeit a weak one, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while closely monitoring changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad.",
        "One of these members presented the opinion that, for stability of the foreign exchange and financial markets and the corporate business activities, it was necessary to put into place a system to mitigate excessive exchange rate volatility, while at the same time pushing ahead actively with plans to facilitate international policy cooperation in the medium- to long-term, such as the Korea-China currency swap-financed trade settlement facility.",
        "Another member asserted that, while attention should be paid to harmonize operation of macroprudential policy － to reduce the factors disturbing the financial markets, such as the household debt situation and the deterioration in fund-raising conditions of those with poor credit ratings monitoring should also be strengthened of the concentration of funds in the markets and the intensification of loan discrimination.",
        "One other member, while stressing the needs for improvement of household sector fundamentals and for structural reforms in the corporate sector so as to expand the growth potential of the economy, suggested that, particularly with regard to support for SMEs, the central bank should consider plans for more active use of its credit policies including its Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans, rather than indiscriminate Base Rate adjustment.",
        "Another member, however, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points, considering the low level of concern about price instability due mainly to the weakened demand-side inflation pressures and to stable import prices, the strong possibility of the low-growth conditions lasting a considerable time and the weak capacity of the private sector for autonomous recovery, and the expansions in accommodative monetary policies in major advanced as well as some emerging market countries.",

        "and construction investment has increased slightly, the Committee appraises the economy to have sustained a weak level of growth as consumption and facilities investment have declined owing to temporary factors.",
        "On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed was smaller in February than in the month before, as a result of the accelerated decline in the number of temporary and daily workers due mainly to the Lunar New Year holiday.",
        "Going forward, there is no change to the Committee’s forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area.",

        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, mainly due to active countercyclical policies in major countries, but judged that such factors as the possibility of a tapering off of US quantitative easing and fiscal uncertainties would remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members noted that, in the international financial markets, stock prices and the values of the currencies of some emerging market countries had declined significantly, influenced by a sharp rise in long-term interest rates in major countries and a reversal of global capital flows, affected by concerns about the earlier-than-expected tapering off of the US Fed’s quantitative easing.",
        "Members assessed the domestic economy as sustaining its economic growth, albeit weak, despite declines in consumption and facilities investment, as exports had improved and construction investment had increased to a great extent.",
        "Concerning the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap would continue for a considerable length of time, as the pace of economic recovery remained modest owing primarily to the slow recovery of the global economy.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had shifted to sharp declines, long-term market interest rates had risen significantly, and the Korean won had also depreciated to a considerable extent, affected mainly by the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing.",
        "Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained its low level of around the 1% level, due in large part to decreases in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products.",
        "Many members forecast that, although inflation would remain stable for the time being as demand-side pressures were weak, it would rise gradually from the latter half of 2013, influenced for instance by an increase in the prices of agricultural and marine products and by a base effect.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period as the domestic economy had maintained its trend of improvement amid stable prices, and as it was forecast to sustain its trend of recovery, albeit moderate, going forward due mainly to the gradual recovery of the global economy, despite risk factors at home and abroad.",
        "One member was of the opinion that, in preparation for a possible intensification of market instability brought about by changes in the monetary policy stance in major countries, the Bank of Korea should reexamine its policy instruments to enable it to respond promptly when necessary, and that it should at the same time pay attention to measures to improve market confidence in order to enhance the policy effect.",
        "Another member stated his opinion that, as the timing of the US Fed’s tapering off of its quantitative easing had become a critical issue, with respect to its possible effects on the Korean economy, the Bank of Korea should consider the possibilities of both large capital inflows and outflows and come up with appropriate measures for either scenario.",
        "Notably, he expressed the view that it would also be necessary to monitor and develop measures in response to the increases in capital flows and sharp fluctuations in exchange rates that might be caused by the different timing of the unwinding of quantitative easing by major countries such as the US and Japan.",
        "Another member mentioned that the Bank of Korea should pay attention to strengthening financial system stability by, for example, mitigating the potential risks of vulnerable groups, while taking care to ensure that household debt which had been steadily increasing of late did not escalate into systemic risks.",
        "Furthermore, noting that domestic demand in terms of consumption and investment remained sluggish although exports were showing a somewhat favorable performance, one member pointed out that it was urgent for the sustainable growth and stability of domestic economy to make efforts to fundamentally improve those factors limiting investment and consumption and to seek new sources of growth.",
        "Lastly, emphasizing the need for an approach to the causes of the slow growth that accorded with a focus on the structural contraction of private consumption rather than attributing it solely to the sluggish global economy, another member suggested it was necessary to ascertain whether the critical point had now been reached beyond which the recovery of private consumption would be held back for a long time by the influence of household debt.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved unanimously by the members.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', 'FX and International Finance' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment was that the overall recovery of the global economy was very modest, with the euro area economy remaining sluggish and with the trends of improvements in the U.S. and Chinese economies falling short of expectations.",
        "Many members mentioned that the international financial markets were sustaining favorable trends, owing mainly to the continued quantitative easing policies of major economies and the easing of the euro-area fiscal crisis.",

        "Concerning the outlook, many members anticipated that the negative output gap would continue for a considerable length of time, as the pace of economic recovery remained modest owing primarily to the slow global economic recovery, the weakening of the Japanese yen, and the geopolitical risk.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices and the exchange rate had fluctuated substantially, under the combined effects of geopolitical risk and concerns about the worsening of corporate performances, and the consequent outflows of foreigners’ portfolio funds.",
        "Many members mentioned that consumer price inflation had maintained its low level at around the 1% range, due in large part to declines in agricultural, livestock and marine product prices and to the stabilization of international commodity prices.",

        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members shared the opinion that, as the recent speed of economic recovery was the slowest since that during the Asian Currency Crisis in 1997, and as consideration should be given to harmonization with the government’s economic policies, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period, even though the domestic economy was forecast to show a trend of improvement, albeit moderate, amid domestic price stability.",
        "One member was of the opinion that the Bank of Korea should on the one hand work to constantly refine its monetary policy instruments, by examining the side-effects arising from the prolongation of low interest rates, the controversies related to the stimulative effect of Base Rate adjustment and the effectiveness of the recently reorganized Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loan, while on the other hand also strengthen its efforts, as the central bank, to put forward policy alternatives for the sound development of the Korean economy in view of the heightened concerns over entrenchment of a trend of low growth caused by the recent delay in economic recovery.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, while paying attention to preventing entrenchment of the trend of low inflation - which had been below the BOK’s medium-term inflation target for an extended period - the Bank of Korea should closely monitor the movements of domestic demand which, centering around consumption, had not as yet recovered.",
        "One other member mentioned that a Base Rate cut at this point in time was somewhat overdue, but that it would still make an important contribution to the strengthening of the weak economic recovery, to the improvement of investor sentiment in the private sector, to the reduction of uncertainties in the foreign exchange and financial markets, and going further to the easing of excessive expectations of Korean won appreciation.",
        "One member pointed out in addition the need to bear in mind that the wasteful costs to the national economy due to the continued controversy about the lack of coordination between macro-economic policies could be greater, at this point in time, than the opportunity costs arising from a 25 basis point reduction in the margin for a further rate cut.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, although the growth rate had fallen somewhat short of economic agents’ expectations, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, since the need for additional quantitative easing to stimulate the economy was small given the potential growth rate, recent GDP data and expected growth path of the Korean economy, and the accommodative liquidity conditions.",

        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, although the trend of growth in domestic economic activity remained weak while prices were stable, given that external conditions were gradually improving and that the domestic economy was moving in the direction of recovery, albeit a weak one, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period while closely monitoring changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad.",
        "One of these members put forward the view that, since the Korean economy is expected to be strongly affected if there are disharmonies among major developed economies in their policy stances related to quantitative easing, leading to a widening of the interest rate gaps among countries, to heightened exchange rate volatility and to a sharp increase in capital flows, the economic movements and policy stances of major economies should be closely monitored and active steps taken to draw up measures for responding as necessary.",
        "Another member emphasized that, while attention was called for to ensure that exports could carry out their role despite changes in the terms of trade, and while close scrutiny of consumption was needed to assist with the recovery of real economic activity, the monitoring of factors disrupting the financial system - such as the household debt situation and the deterioration in financial conditions of those with poor credit ratings and of abrupt surges in foreign currency flows, should be strengthened.",
        "One other member was of the opinion that great attention should be paid to topics which had recently become social issues, such as legalization of the shadow economy, alleviation of household debt problems and the development of measures to increase the household savings rate, and that the central bank should study in depth the role that it should play in this regard.",
        "Another member, however, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points, considering the weakening of demand-side inflation pressures, the sustained sluggishness of consumption, the investment and export indicators in the domestic real sector that were unlikely to show clear improvements for a considerable period of time, and the spread of accommodative monetary policies in major advanced countries and some emerging markets.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the members compiled a statement that reflected the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Ha, Seong Keun expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point cut.",
        "today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but economic activities in the euro area to have been unable to shake off their sluggishness, while emerging market countries have shown continuing economic growth.",
        "The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not lifted and remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "and construction investment has increased slightly, the Committee appraises the economy to have sustained a weak level of growth as consumption and facilities investment have declined owing to temporary factors.",
        "On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed was smaller in February than in the month before, as a result of the accelerated decline in the number of temporary and daily workers due mainly to the Lunar New Year holiday.",
        "Going forward, there is no change to the Committee’s forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area.",
        "agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels similar to those in the previous month, at 1.4% and 1.3% respectively in February.",
        "Inflation appears likely to remain relatively low, due to the weakening of demand-side pressures; the Committee forecasts, however, that it will rise above its current level as downward pressures from institutional factors partially disappear.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their moderate uptrend.",
        "as the influences of foreigners’ stock investment fund inflows and of the increase in Korea’s geopolitical risk have coincided, while long-term market interest rates have fallen due mainly to large inflows of foreigners’ bond investment funds.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had fluctuated within a certain range, but has risen recently, owing largely to the emergence of geopolitical risk.",
        "factors and Korea’s geopolitical risk and any consequent changes in financial and economic conditions, continue its efforts to lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment was that, despite the continued sluggishness of the euro area economy, the global economy was sustaining a recovery, albeit weak, on the strength of improvements in US and emerging market economies.",
        "Many members pointed out that, although the international financial markets remained generally stable, due to the easing for now of concerns about the US fiscal cliff and to the expanded quantitative easing in major countries, the possibility of market instability recurring still remained.",
        "Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing its weak growth with indicators related to exports and domestic demand alternating between improving and worsening.",
        "Concerning the outlook, members anticipated that, although the extent of increase in exports would rise as the trend of improvement in the world economy continued, it would likely to take some time for the economy to return to its long-term growth trend since the recovery of domestic demand was constrained.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had risen and the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, due to inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds in consequence of the overall improvement in international financial market conditions, and that market interest rates had shifted to a declining trend, primarily on expectations of further Base Rate cuts.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Many members noted that, helped by the stability of livestock and petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation was running at around the 1% level, and forecast that, with the negative output gap continuing amid stable international commodity prices, it would remain low for the time being.",
        "With regard to real estate prices, one member mentioned that, housing prices were continuing their downtrend, due mainly to economic uncertainties and the spread of expectations of housing price decline.",
        "He went on to note that, although housing leasehold deposit prices were sustaining their upward trend, their pace of increase was slowing somewhat.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: While major economic indicators had improved amid the stabilized domestic inflation, employment had slowed and investment remained sluggish.",
        "In addition, there were growing concerns about the deteriorating export competitiveness and business profitability due to continuing uncertainties of the global economy and to the falling exchange rate.",
        "The government plans to strengthen its policy measures to enhance economic dynamism, for example through facilitation of investment, while closely monitoring economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, although domestic economic activity was forecast to continue its weak trend of growth while prices would likely remain stable for a considerable time, given that the uncertainties at home and abroad were gradually decreasing, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while closely monitoring changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad.",
        "Some of these members expressed the opinion that, while paying attention to the recent situation of continuing foreign capital inflows due to the easing of global financial market unease and the abundant global liquidity, and of plunging exchange rates, there was a need for directing various efforts to the easing of exchange rate volatility.",
        "They also pointed out that attention needed to be paid to the possibility that the recent upward pressures on the won, if protracted for long at levels greatly estranged from domestic economic fundamentals, might have increasingly negative effects on the real economy and cause misalignments of price variables including exchange and interest rates.",
        "One other member presented the view that, since the household debt issue was closely related with structural changes in the domestic economy, such as the imbalance in income distribution between businesses and households and the reversal of long-running unidirectional real estate price expectations, and that it had a direct effect on expansion of the growth potential, the various policy authorities should take comprehensive measures to cope with this issue, with a focus on the fundamental changes in the economic structure.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, although the global economic uncertainties had eased somewhat, considering the persisting downside risks and the weaker-than-expected recovery of the domestic economy it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",
        "Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",

        "On the employment front, the increase in number of persons employed in December was somewhat smaller than that the month before, a result mainly of weak construction sector employment due to bad weather conditions.",
        "Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area.",

        "Many members expected the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, due mainly to improvements in the US economy, but judged that factors such as the possibility of a tapering off of the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing and the uncertainties surrounding fiscal consolidation in major countries would remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "Many members mentioned that, in the international financial markets, yields on major country government bonds had risen sharply, due mainly to concerns about the US Fed’s early tapering off of quantitative easing, and that stock prices and currency values in emerging market countries had fallen as global investment funds had flowed out from those countries in large amounts.",
        "Members assessed that, despite continued sluggishness in private consumption and facilities investment, the domestic economy had recently sustained its growth, albeit weakly, led by construction investment and exports owing to an expansion in fiscal expenditure and to declines in international oil prices.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea’s website.",
        "Concerning the future outlook, many members anticipated that the negative GDP gap would narrow steadily as external conditions gradually improved and as the effects of the supplementary budget and the Base Rate cut began to materialize in full.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that, due to the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of quantitative easing by the US Fed, government bond yields had risen greatly and stock prices declined, and that there was growing credit risk aversion in the corporate bond market, centering around weak industries.",
        "Many members mentioned that, although consumer price inflation had risen compared to the month previous with the shifts to increase in the prices of agricultural and livestock products and petroleum products, it had maintained its low level of around the 1%.",
        "Many members forecast that, although inflation would gradually rise from the latter half of 2013, influenced for instance by increases in the prices of agricultural and fisheries products and by a base effect, it would remain stable for the time being as demand-side pressures were weak.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follow: Members shared the opinion that, although the uncertainties about external conditions were growing and domestic financial market volatility had expanded, the domestic economy was maintaining its trend of improvement amid stable prices and was forecast to sustain its trend of recovery, albeit moderate, going forward as well, due mainly to the gradual recovery of the global economy, and it was thus desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Concerning the US Fed’s movement toward tapering off of quantitative easing, which had emerged as a downside risk to the Korean domestic financial markets and real economy, one of these members expressed the opinion that the focus of monetary policy should be placed on minimizing the resulting shocks to Korea.",
        "Another member commented that an effective, appropriate level of foreign reserves should be maintained as a precaution against the possibility of sudden stop following a contraction in global liquidity, and that, while improving the macroeconomic fundamentals, it was necessary to ensure the minimization of foreign exchange market volatility through the use of effective macroprudential tools.",
        "Another member meanwhile pointed out that, considering the fact that the domestic financial markets had the structural character of vulnerability to external shocks, monitoring should be strengthened to prepare against the financial market unrest that could arise due to any such heightening of external uncertainties, while preemptive and active responses should be taken as needed to maintain financial market stability.",
        "One member argued in addition that, given that central banks in major countries had been devoting efforts to enhancing the predictabilities of their monetary policy, by for instance using forward guidance, there was a need to come up with measures for smooth communication with the markets corresponding to Korean conditions.",
        "Finally, another member expressed the view that, to ensure smooth functioning of the Base Rate transmission mechanism, it was necessary to continuously check the linkages between short- and long-term interest rates and to consider measures for systemic improvement to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy as needed.",
        "Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by the members.",
        ": - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat.",
        "The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing and of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and to the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries, remain as downside risks to growth.",
        "- In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to be continuing, albeit weakly, as exports have been generally favorable while indicators of domestic demand have alternated between improvement and worsening.",
        "On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group and the service sector.",
        "The domestic economy is expected to maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy, although the Committee forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.",
        "- Consumer price inflation was 1.0% in June, the same as in May, as the prices of agricultural, livestock, fisheries and petroleum products continued their declines of the previous month and as service prices maintained their low rate of increase.",
        "Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products declined slightly to extent of decline in the prices of livestock products.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will show a stable trend for the time being as the output gap remains negative, although it will rise above its present level due mainly to a base effect from its low rate of increase in the second half of last year.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas declined, while those in the rest of the country continued their slight uptrend.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, as in the international financial markets, the volatility of price variables has increased with the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing.",
        "Stock prices have fallen substantially due to outflows of foreigners’ stock investment funds, while long-term market interest rates have risen in concert with those of major economies.",
        "After having depreciated greatly, the Korean won has appreciated to a considerable extent.",
        "- Looking ahead, while closely monitoring the trends and the influences of changes in external risk factors, and the effects of May’s Base Rate cut and of the government’s economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."

        "Members also noted that, while the international financial markets had generally shown stable movements, global interest rates had declined, stock prices had risen, and global capital had shown inflows to emerging market countries.",
        "As to the domestic economy, most members assessed the economic recovery to have continued, with indicators related to exports and domestic demand showing favorable movements.",
        "However, they expressed concerns about the negative effects on domestic demand of the Sewol ferry accident, and one member mentioned that the momentum of economic recovery was not evident, with domestic demand indicators having declined quarter-on-quarter for example.",
        "In the domestic financial markets, members noted that stock prices had fallen, the Korean won had appreciated due mainly to the continuation of the current account surplus and to inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds, and interest rates had moved within a narrow range.",

        "One member noted that there was a possibility that the current account surplus and the expansion in foreign capital inflows would increase exchange rate volatility and cause excessive movement of the exchange rate in one direction.",
        "He then pointed out the need for paying close attention to residents’ foreign currency deposits, which had expanded recently, since should they decline all at once the unidirectional movement of exchange rates could intensify.",
        "One other member argued that, as downside risks to the growth paths of both the domestic and the international economies remained, there was a need to conduct monetary policy so as to minimize the effects of factors limiting growth in the financial and real sectors, while working to steady economic agents’ expectations.",
        "One other member pointed out that there had been a wide divergence appearing between the rates of increase in the index of industrial production and in GDP of late, a divergence considered to be attributable to non-temporary factors such as the rapid growth of the IT sector.",
        "He went on to express the opinion that it was thus necessary to make improvements to the index of industrial production and to strengthen communication with the market for explaining the difference between the two statistics.",
        "Another member meanwhile noted the need for cautions concerning the influence of the contraction in economic agents’ sentiment following the Sewol ferry accident on the trend of economic recovery, and about the future path of the USD/KRW rate.",
        "Lastly, one member forecast that the trend of improvement in economic activities would continue and that consumer price inflation would gradually rise to its target level going forward, but commented that there were still concerns about a slowdown in domestic demand due to external uncertainties and to the Sewol ferry accident, and that any excessive appreciation of the won could work as a downside risk to growth and prices.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of these discussions, the following statement was prepared with the unanimous consent of all members: today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have weakened somewhat.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe.",

        "- Consumer price inflation rose from 1.3% the previous month to 1.5% in April, due mainly to expansions in the extent of increase in service fees and in industrial product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose from 2.1% to 2.3%.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to the stability of agricultural product prices.",
        "Regarding the housing market, the uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country slowed.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was that, while the US economic recovery had continued, the recovery in the euro area had been sluggish.",
        "Members also noted that the international financial markets had shown increasing volatility, due mainly to concerns about an early policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, to geopolitical risks, and to worries about the economic slowdowns in China and the euro area.",
        "As to the domestic economy, many members’ appraisal was that, while consumption had increased and exports had sustained a favorable pattern, the economic recovery was insufficient, with facilities investment declining for example.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that long-term interest rates had declined, the KRW/USD exchange rate had risen, and stock prices had fallen significantly.",
        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood at 1.1%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that the possibility was also high that it would be below the inflation target for the time being.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member advanced the opinion that the Base Rate should be cut by 0.25 of a percentage point because, if the changes in domestic and international financial and economic conditions during the previous month were considered comprehensively, the growth path of the Korean economy appeared to have shifted slightly downward, on a contraction in consumption and the sluggishness in facilities investment for example, while the situation of low inflation was expected to persist longer than in the previous forecast.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, although determining the direction of the Base Rate was very difficult, cutting it by 0.25 of a percentage point would be desirable in view of the following points: firstly, that the time when the negative GDP gap would disappear was highly likely to be delayed beyond that originally anticipated, given the downward adjustment of the economic growth rate forecast; secondly, that the lower-than-expected inflationary pressures provided scope to support growth further in terms of monetary policy, and thirdly, that the contraction in economic agents’ sentiment was remaining a downside risk to future growth.",
        "One other member stated his opinion that it would be necessary to reduce the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point this month because the potential risks of keeping it unchanged were judged to outweigh the side effects of its being cut.",
        "He argued in justification that the forecast growth path had been adjusted downward and the time of negative GDP gap resolution might be delayed even longer, that due to the continuation of low inflation the confidence in price stability might weaken and deflation expectations might form, and that some scope for an additional Base Rate cut had arisen since the appropriate Base Rate level in consideration of the real neutral rate was analyzed to have declined owing to the prolongation of the negative GDP and price gaps, while the real interest rate was rising due to the slowdown in inflation.",
        "Apart from this, the household credit cycle was not considered to currently be in an overheating phase where excessive household credit expansion cause systemic risk, while the outflows of foreign investment funds following a Base Rate cut were judged unlikely to lead to fundamental market disturbances.",
        "Another member mentioned that the recovery of the overall global economy had weakened, that amid the continuing trend of low inflation uncertainties about the domestic economic recovery were persisting, and that price variable volatility in the financial and foreign exchange markets was rising as anticipations for and concerns about changes in domestic and foreign economies and policies were intersecting.",
        "He went on to state that it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point for the month.",
        "One other member, after expressing the view that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage point, noted that this would strengthen the public signalling of the monetary authorities’ policy intention, and at the same time was expected to contribute to boosting the capacity for adapting to the recent changes in the external environment, to the revival of the sluggish domestic demand, and to controlling the prolongation of the low inflation trend.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.25 percent for the intermeeting period, commenting then that the Korean economy’s recovery being a little weaker than expected was due to exports having been more sluggish than originally forecast and so, since exports were contributing more to Korean economic growth than consumption, solid export growth was an essential precondition for a rapid economic recovery.",
        "With regard to concerns about disinflation the member also noted that, unlike disinflation caused by an aggregate demand shortage, disinflation attributable mainly to fiercer corporate competition triggered by innovations in distribution and an expansion in imports could be considered a positive phenomenon for the Korean economy.",
        "He went on to state that, given that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had been continually rising since passing through its trough in December 2012, and that the low inflation was expected to last until the second half of 2015 when the output gap was forecast to disappear, it was difficult to consider any shortfall in demand as being the main cause behind the recent low inflation phenomenon.",
        "The member added that the recent low inflation seemed attributable largely to distribution innovations following the increased numbers of megastores and online stores, as well as to growth in imports including through the expansion of trade with China, and considering that the downward pressures on inflation would grow further, due for example to the Korea-China FTA expected to be concluded in the future, Korea’s current inflation target of 2.5∼3.5 percent was judged to be at a higher than appropriate level and, rather than responding to the recent low inflation through a policy of expanding demand, priority thus needed to be placed upon resetting the appropriate level of inflation target.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the discussions held earlier, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "Moon, Woosik expressed clear opposition to the idea of lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for holding it at its current level.",
        "today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the prolongation of economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks.",
        "□ In Korea, while exports have sustained a favorable pattern and consumption has improved somewhat, the Committee judges that facilities investment remains sluggish and that economic agents’ sentiment has only partially recovered.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although the time of its disappearance will be somewhat later than previously forecast.",
        "in September, due mainly to an increase in the extent of decline in petroleum product prices and to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.9%, from 2.4% in August.",
        "The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low due primarily to the stability of agricultural and international oil prices, inflation will gradually rise next year; it judges, however, that inflationary pressures will be somewhat weaker than previously expected.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country accelerated.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy had maintained its trend of recovery, the euro area economy had sustained its weak recovery, and the Chinese economy had exhibited the same level of growth seen in the first quarter of this year.",
        "Members also noted that the international financial markets had shown stable movements generally, as global interest rates had declined and stock prices had risen.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members commented that, while exports had been buoyant, indicators related to consumption and the service sector had been subdued.",
        "In line with this, a few members expressed concerns about the possibility of prolongation of decline in consumer and investor confidence, and about movements toward a structural slowdown of consumption including a general decline in the propensity to consume.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets members noted that, with the inflows of securities investment funds of foreigners continuing, interest rates had fallen, stock prices had risen, and the Korean won had appreciated.",
        "Several members commented that it was necessary to pay attention to the continuous appreciation of the won, and to the deterioration in bank profitability in line with the narrowing of the loan-to-deposit interest rate spread.",
        "With regard to prices, members mentioned that consumer price inflation English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "had registered 1.7% in May, higher than in the month previous.",
        "Several members anticipated that consumer price inflation would rise at an increasingly faster pace going forward.",
        "However, one member noted that, due mainly to the contraction in domestic demand and to the pressures from the appreciating Korean won, the odds of consumer price inflation remaining at a low level were also not small.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member, although judging that the economic recovery was being maintained despite a slight slowdown in the trend of improvement in domestic economic activities, expressed the view that for now it was desirable to observe the situation a little longer, given the difficulty in predicting to what extent downside risks, such as Korean won appreciation and the prolongation of the decline in consumer and investor sentiment following the Sewol ferry accident, would affect the future growth path.",
        "Another member stated the opinion that, in a situation in which domestic long-term interest rates had fallen sharply recently, there was a need to secure policy measures capable of mitigating severe swings in market interest rates, since there were concerns that when international interest rates do begin to rise in response to the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization, domestic long-term interest rates could surge and work as a factor causing financial instability.",
        "One other member noted the emergence, amid high levels of household and corporate sector leverage, of destabilizing factors on the qualitative side such as debt structure vulnerabilities and credit market polarization.",
        "He expressed the opinion that there were thus concerns about a possible heightening of financial instability in the event of a future rise in interest rates, and so it was necessary to carry out micro analysis and to develop countermeasures in response.",
        "Another member meanwhile advocated the need, in order to escape the prevailing trend of slow growth coupled with low inflation, for reviewing the effects of monetary and credit policy while at the same time checking to see whether domestic demand was showing clear signs of recovery, such as improvements in consumption, whether the medium- and long-term export structure was changing, and whether the global economy had broken from its pattern of low growth and low inflation, and paying close attention to the divergent directions of advanced countries’ monetary policies and the resulting financial and foreign exchange market trends.",
        "Lastly, one other member put forward the view that particular attention should be paid to major economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "He went on to stress that future consumption and investment patterns, low inflation trend, current account surplus trend and patterns of foreign investment fund inflows should all be subject to intensive analysis and examination.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy was again maintaining its trend of recovery, after having contracted temporarily due to severe weather conditions, and that other advanced countries including the euro area and Japan had also sustained their recovery trends, while Chinese economic activity had shown some slowing, with exports declining significantly under the influence for example of the Lunar New Year holidays.",
        "Members meanwhile assessed the international financial markets as having remained stable overall, due chiefly to the easing of financial unrest in emerging market countries, although some noted that risk factors did remain, including additional reductions in the scale of asset purchases by the US Fed and the possibility of expansions in financial unrest in emerging market countries.",

        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had registered a low level of 1.0 percent, due mainly to the expansion in the pace of decline in petroleum product prices and to the slowing of the upward trend of service charges.",
        "They also forecast that, while remaining low for the time being, inflation would gradually rise going forward.",
        "Some members added that there was a need for close monitoring of overall conditions related to the price path, including the possibility of a change in the expected inflation rate owing to inflation having remained low for a long period of time.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the view that, while keeping a careful watch for example on the situation of risks in the Chinese economy, and on the monetary policy operations of major advanced countries, it would be wise to closely examine the influences of these factors on the domestic economy, prices and financial market conditions.",
        "Another member stated the opinion that it would be appropriate to maintain the current policy stance until the release of the economic outlook in April, as, with inflation maintaining a low level for the time being, the domestic economy was expected to sustain its trend of modest improvement due largely to the recovery in the global economy and the improvements in domestic demand conditions.",
        "One other member expressed the view, in relation to the government’s aim of improving the household debt structure, that careful management was required to achieve that goal, since a reduction in household lending conflicted in some respect with the revitalization of the real estate market.",
        "He also noted that attention should be given to the fact that, should household lending be artificially constrained, this would have the adverse effects of expansions in SOHO and private loans and of financial exclusion of vulnerable groups.",
        "He stated the view as well that, since Korea’s high household debt ratio was closely related to its considerably higher share of real assets compared to other countries, achieving the goal of household debt management called for an accompanying policy to revitalize the securitization of real assets.",
        "One member stated the opinion that the effects of monetary and fiscal policy should be monitored, to prevent the trends of slow growth and low inflation from becoming entrenched, while attention would have to be paid to risk factors at home and abroad, such as the weakening of the endogenous resilience of domestic demand, including consumption and investment, and the possibility of international financial market unrest spilling over to the domestic economy.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, although the possibility of the recent unrest in certain emerging market economies severely affecting the domestic economy was not high for the moment, it should be borne in mind that the impacts on the global economy of shocks from emerging market countries could well be greater than in the past, and that the degrees of the Korean economy’s financial market openness and dependence on external trade were much higher than in other countries.",
        "Lastly, one other member put forward the opinion that, since an expansion in the housing demand capacity of median income bracket households was essential for medium- and long-term real estate price stability, and there were currently concerns that the improvement in these households’ financial structures might have slowed, an empirical assessment of their house purchasing power was necessary.",
        "He went on to also express the view that it was necessary to examine whether the improvement in Korea’s trade deficit with Japan evident since 2011 was attributable to structural changes in Korean trade with Japan.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of these discussions, the following statement was prepared with the unanimous consent of all members: - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have shown signs of weakening to some extent.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s QE tapering and by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries.",
        "- In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth, as exports continue their trend of increase amid the coexistence of improvements in and sluggishness of domestic-demand related indicators.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially, in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.",
        "- Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 1.1% the previous month to 1.0% in February, due mainly to an increase in the extent of the decline in petroleum product prices, but core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products registered 1.7%, just as in January.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to a good agricultural crop harvest.",
        "Regarding the housing market, sales prices rose slightly in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country, while leasehold-deposit prices in both regions continued to increase at paces similar to those during the month before.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, after having risen due mainly to international financial market stability stock prices have fallen back, primarily on increased concerns about economic slowdown in China.",

        "Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile moved within a relatively narrow range.",
        "- Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies and geopolitical risk in Eastern Europe, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was that, while the US economic recovery had been sustained, the recovery in the euro area had weakened temporarily and there were destabilizing factors including a real estate market slump in the Chinese economy despite its continued trend of growth.",
        "Members also observed that the international financial markets had shown generally stable movements, and the US dollar had strengthened.",
        "As to the domestic economy, many members’ appraisal was that the economic recovery had been modest although consumption had increased and indicators of facilities investment and manufacturing production were showing favorable movements.",
        "Some members commented that it was uncertain whether the Korean economy would show clear signs of recovery going forward.",
        "Regarding employment, one member noted that, despite an increase in the number of persons employed and a slight improvement in the employment rate, the labor market continued to show only limited improvements in qualitative terms.",
        "Another member argued that the slack in the labor market would work as a factor reducing the upward pressures on wages and inflation.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, some members mentioned that attention should be paid to the fact that, although the euro and the yen for example were showing weakness due to the appreciation of the dollar globally, the won had in contrast strengthened.",
        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood at 1.4%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that it would remain at a low level for the time being.",
        "Some members meanwhile expressed the view that it was difficult to judge the recent sharp rise in bank lending to households as indicating a trend of increase, since it had been attributable mainly to exceptional factors including the expanded lending of policy mortgage loans.",
        "They added, however, that careful monitoring of the future household debt trend and the associated risk factors were needed.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One of them noted that, given the rising possibility of prolongations of the domestic demand slump and the low inflation, the continuing trends of quantitative easing worldwide as exemplified by the ECB’s policy rate cut and the sharp depreciation of the yen, and the ongoing large Korean current account surplus and strong appreciation pressures on the won, the conditions for a further Base Rate cut had built up to a considerable extent.",
        "He then expressed the opinion that, although the Base Rate should be kept at its current level for the intermeeting period, there was a need to examine in depth the evolution of conditions calling for a Base Rate cut and also to monitor the effects of the previous month’s Base Rate cut and of the government’s comprehensive economic policy measures.",
        "Another member noted that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level this month, it was necessary to verify whether the August rate cut and the government’s economic stimulus policies had had the effect of stimulating domestic demand.",
        "He then added that, while paying attention to whether the concerns about an increase in household debt due to the easing of housing finance regulations might be realized, the influences on the Korean economy of the policy stances of the US Federal Reserve and the ECB, and of the geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East, would have to be closely examined.",
        "One other member commented that the downside risks to the growth path were high, as economic growth had weakened more in the second quarter than originally forecast and as the trends of recovery of both economic sentiment and domestic demand had also been less than robust in the third quarter, and that the trend of narrowing of the negative inflation gap had weakened with consumer price inflation having slowed for two months in a row.",
        "He went on to state the opinion that this situation of long lasting negative GDP and inflation gaps, together with the structural problems of the Korean economy, could fundamentally weaken Korea’s growth momentum.",
        "The same member then expressed the view that, considering the time lag before the effects of the August Base Rate cut materialized, and the possibility of an increase in household debt risk, it was necessary to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the month, and to keep a close watch on the future movements of economic indicators.",
        "Another member advocated the need for maintaining the Base Rate at its current level this month, while at the same time closely monitoring the effects of the economic policies put in place so far by the Bank of Korea and the Korean government, the changes in sentiment of economic agents, the strength of the domestic demand recovery, household lending trends, and the possibility of a change in the US Fed’s monetary policy stance.",
        "He added that policy communication should be carried out in such a way as to ensure that market expectations regarding the direction of future monetary policy were not one-sided.",
        "One other member also put forward the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and added that there was a need to closely examine whether the channels of transmission of the August Base Rate cut were functioning properly.",
        "The same member went on to argue that, if the downward movement of lending rates was being driven by corporate lending rates, and household lending rates had not been adjusted to any great degree since the Base Rate cut, then it would be difficult to achieve the policy goal of expanding households’ spending power.",
        "He also pointed out that, in the current exceptional situation of a continuing trend of low interest rates, the effects of economic stimulus could decline if the cuts in corporate lending rates did not bring about any actual increase in corporate investment.",
        "One other member took the view that, considering overall economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, the downside risks to the growth path appeared to have increased and the low inflation conditions were expected to persist for a longer time, and it was thus difficult to argue that the fears related to household debt were being realized.",
        "He then argued that the Base Rate should be adjusted slightly downward from its current level, on the judgement that a succession of policy rate cuts would be more effective as a preemptive policy response.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the discussions held earlier, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a slight rate cut.",
        "today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.25% for the intermeeting period.",

        "Committee judges that improvements in domestic demand, which had contracted due mainly to the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident, have been insufficient, and that the consumption and investment sentiments of economic agents also continue to show sluggishness.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although its pace of narrowing will be moderate.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.6% the month before to 1.4% in August, due mainly to increases in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, while the US economy was sustaining its favorable growth, the recovery in Japan and the euro area had been feeble and economic growth in China had slowed somewhat.",
        "Members also judged that, in the international markets, the US dollar had strengthened, interest rates had generally declined, and stock prices had risen centering around advanced countries.",
        "Related to the domestic economy, many members appraised the momentum of economic recovery as having lacked strength, with domestic demand-related indicators appearing subdued, and also noted that sentiment indices had been sluggish.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members noted that volatility had increased, with long-term interest rates falling and then rebounding sharply, and that the won/dollar exchange rate had continued on an upward trend.",
        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood at 1.0%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that it would remain at a low level for a considerable time, influenced for instance by the fall in international oil prices.",

        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member argued that, amid the continued weak momentum of the economic recovery, the downside risks to prices appeared to have become greater due to the decline in oil prices for example, and financial market participants’ anticipations of a further Base Rate cut seemed to have grown somewhat compared to November, but that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since the trends of economic activities and consumer price inflation needed to be monitored a little while longer, considering that the effects of the Base Rate cuts had not been fully reflected in the real economy and that the government planned to front load its budgetary expenditure as much as possible in 2015.",
        "Another member stated the opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "With regard to the recent sharp drop in international oil prices, to the 70 dollars per barrel level, he argued that, since a decline in oil prices caused by supply-side factors would lead to increases in net incomes and consumption and ultimately boost the economic growth rate, excessive concern about the oil price decline was uncalled for, before going on to state that attention should be paid to the possibility of a drop in oil import costs in line with that in international oil prices, causing the current account surplus to widen and in consequence exerting substantial upward pressures on the Korean won.",
        "The member also noted that government fiscal expenditures had fallen short of the original budgets in economic recovery through synergy effects with monetary policy, the government must devote every effort to carrying out fiscal spending as planned or to improve the flow of funds, by for example the accurate forecast of tax revenues and the drawing up of a formal schedule for Treasury bond issuance.",
        "One other member commented that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it would be desirable to closely examine the effects of the Base Rate cuts so far, the movements of international oil prices, changes in monetary policy in major countries and their influences, and the domestic household debt trend.",
        "He went on to note that, although there was little likelihood of the fears recently raised in some quarters concerning deflation being realized, the spread itself of these apprehensions might dampen consumption and investment through a self-fulfilling process, and it was thus necessary to communicate actively with market participants and the general public based upon accurate and objective analysis and assessment of the current economic situation.",
        "The member also mentioned that, in response to the trends of persistent slow growth and low inflation, and of the weakening of potential growth, the major factors underlying the deflation concerns, it was essential to carry out research on the possibility of employing policy tools other than the Base Rate.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month, while closely examining domestic and international risk factors and the channels of Base Rate cut transmission, as the expected benefits of a Base Rate adjustment did not greatly outweigh its potential risks in a situation of persistent uncertainties related to the future growth and price paths, for example of an increase in exchange rate volatility and sharp fall in oil prices continuing on from the previous month.",
        "He went on to note that the stability of inflation expectations had eroded due to the coexistence of conflicting market expectations as to the direction of monetary policy operation given the growing contradictions between the price stability and the financial stability targets in line with the persistent low inflation and the sharp increase in household debt.",
        "He added then that, in future monetary policy operations, greater emphasis should be placed on the formation of inflation expectations consistent with an appropriate price target.",
        "One other member mentioned that, amid weak paces of improvement in economic activities in major countries apart from the US, there was no clearly pronounced momentum of economic recovery in Korea as domestic real economic indicators were also generally poor, that business conditions and policy directions had diverged in major countries, and that a risk existed of the volatility in the international financial markets increasing.",
        "The member went on to advance a view that the Base Rate should be kept at its current level for the month, while on the one hand support should be provided to ensure that the economic stimulation and monetary easing measures could actually take effect amid the uncertainties caused by changes in global conditions, and on the other hand efforts should be made to create a stable base of macroeconomic fundamentals through for example stepping up the monitoring of potential risk factors at home and abroad.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, amid the recently increased downside risks to and volatility in the global economy, domestic demand and price conditions in the Korean economy were also still weak and showing uncertain movements.",
        "He went on to argue that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged for the month, and presented the view that the foreign exchange authorities should concentrate more of their policy capacity on stabilization of the Korean won exchange rate since, although the synchronization of the Korean won with the Japanese yen had progressed to a certain extent due to the Korean won’s depreciation until that time, its degree might weaken and exchange rate volatility increase in the future.",
        "The member went on to state that the policy authorities should carefully analyze the fundamental background behind the low inflation, that had now persisted for more than two and one-half years, and take measures to prevent its negative effects from intensifying.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery had continued led by the US, the euro area, Japan and other advanced countries, and that the Chinese economy was also maintaining its solidly-based growth.",
        "However, some members noted that there were also destabilizing factors present such as the possibility of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.",
        "Concerning the international financial markets, members assessed volatility as having expanded with global stock prices falling and interest rates in emerging market countries rising due mainly to the US Fed’s additional reduction of the scale of its asset purchases and to financial unrest in some emerging market countries.",
        "They also noted that risk factors remained, including a possible expansion of financial unrest in emerging market countries.",
        "As to the domestic economy, most members’ assessment was that favorable economic movements had continued with exports sustaining their uptrends.",
        "They forecast that the economic recovery would be maintained, driven largely by the economic recovery centered around advanced countries, and the restoration of consumer and investor confidence.",
        "In the domestic financial markets, members noted that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated, influenced mainly by outflows of foreigners’ stock investment funds and by financial unrest in emerging market countries, and that bond yields had meanwhile fluctuated within a English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "narrow range due mainly to inflows of foreigners’ bond investment funds.",
        "As to prices, members, noting that consumer price inflation had registered a low level of just above 1 percent due mainly to the stability of agricultural product prices which had largely offset the hikes in public utility charges, anticipated that inflation would gradually pick up going forward, although it would remain low for the time being.",
        "Meanwhile, one member commented that the volume of household lending had increased substantially in 2013 as compared to 2012, and that household lending by the non-banking sector, in particular, had expanded greatly.",
        "He went on to express the view that these upward trends should be monitored closely going forward.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, taking into overall consideration domestic and international economic environment and outlook, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "With regard to the weakness of the yen serving as a risk factor for the foreign exchange sector and the real economy, one member expressed the view that attention should be paid to the possibility of a change in the yen’s character as a safe haven asset and to the effects of the ECB’s additional quantitative easing, which might both affect the underlying movement of the yen’s exchange rate.",
        "Concerning real estate policy, which had been the focus of lively discussion, the same member went on to state his opinion that it would be advisable once having set housing prices on a course that would admit modest deleveraging from a medium- and long-term perspective, the focus of policy should then be placed on encouraging more active house sales and the stability of the market for rented housing.",
        "Another member commented that although the recovery of the domestic economy had been sustained since the second half of last year albeit at a weaker pace, there was no clear sign of its gaining momentum.",
        "He also expressed concern that, since the recent recovery was attributable largely to the policy authorities’ economic stimulation policy and the improvement in economic indicators rested mainly upon the increased exports of certain items and by certain businesses, there would only be a limited effect in its spread to the rest of the economy.",
        "One other member argued that it would be necessary to coordinate monetary and macroprudential policies to minimize the negative effects on the domestic economy of an increase in the international financial market volatility, while working to maintain economic agents’ expectations within stable bounds as uncertainty remained concerning the growth path of both the domestic and the international economy.",
        "The member went on to note that it would be necessary to examine the effects of monetary and fiscal policies to ensure the trend of slow growth and slow price rises did not become firmly entrenched, and to strengthen the monitoring of the transmission of international financial market risks to the domestic financial market.",
        "One member asserted that it would be problematic for the Chinese fixed asset investment that had sustained the country’s growth to maintain its current rate of increase given the need to promote structural reform and adjust overcapacity.",
        "Particularly as China’s ratio of gross capital formation to GDP was nearing 50%, it was inevitable that the growth of its investment would decline sooner or later.",
        "In line with this, he argued that the possibility of a hard landing of the Chinese economy should be closely monitored.",
        "In addition, one other member expressed the view that the domestic economy was showing relatively stable movement, despite the increased international financial market unrest and that the domestic economy was maintaining its recovery in line with its forecast growth path, with domestic demand and exports continuing to improve.",
        "Finally, another member stated his opinion that the uncertainties surrounding external conditions remained while domestic economic growth and prices were following the path forecast in the preceding month.",

        "Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 1.9% the month previous to 1.7%, due mainly to the slowing of the uptrends in prices of industrial products other than petroleum.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to the stability of international commodity prices.",
        "Regarding the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country slowed.",

        "Members also noted that, with the international financial markets showing generally favorable movements, global interest rates had declined and stock prices had risen.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members judged that the economic recovery had shown signs of weakening as domestic demand-related indicators had become subdued.",
        "Most members expressed concerns about issues such as the contractions in consumer and investor confidence and the weakening of consumption due to structural factors, while some noted the possibility of a further delay in the economic recovery going forward.",
        "One member however mentioned that there was also a possibility of the domestic economy returning quickly to its originally forecast growth path, since the effects of the Sewol ferry accident were judged to be limited to only temporary shocks In the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that long-term interest rates and exchange rates had fallen and that the credit differentiation (where only companies with high credit ratings have access to credit) in the corporate bond market was persisting.",
        "With regard to prices, members mentioned that consumer price inflation stood at 1.7%, as in the previous month.",
        "Several members anticipated that English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "consumer price inflation would gradually rise but that inflationary pressures would be weaker than initially expected – due chiefly to downward pressures on inflation from the supply side, resulting largely from the decline in import prices with the appreciation of the Korean won and from the continuing weakness in agricultural product prices, as well as to the sluggishness of aggregate demand owing to the domestic demand slowdown.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One of them noted that, although the world economy had been gradually improving, the downside risks to growth had been mounting again of late, and although the Korean economy was also continuing its trend of growth, centering around exports, it was unclear whether this trend would remain firmly on track going forward.",
        "He went on to express the view that, as the contraction in domestic demand since the Sewol ferry accident had been accelerating, while inflation also remained at an unprecedentedly low level, close monitoring by the policy authorities was necessary.",
        "Another member offered the opinion that, inasmuch as the trends of economic recovery at home and abroad had not been solid, monetary policy should be conducted so that the effects of factors constraining the growth of and causing imbalances between the financial and the real sectors could be minimized and the momentum for economic recovery found, while economic agents’ sentiments were managed stably so as to avoid their falling into a low expectation trap.",
        "One other member noted that, although the downward revision of the economic growth forecast for Korea in 2014, compared to the original forecast, appeared attributable not just to temporary shocks but also to structural factors causing sluggishness in domestic demand, neither the future direction of the growth path nor the trend of narrowing of the output gap were judged to have reversed.",
        "This member went on to note that, while the trend of a narrowing of the price gap itself had not changed, there was a possibility that its pace would be quite moderate.",
        "He also stated the opinion that, although the current credit cycle was judged to not be in a phase of overheating, the effects that any adjustment to the Base Rate might bring about should be considered with great caution, given the high level of leverage and the structural vulnerabilities of household debt, the polarization of the corporate credit market, and the signs of a contraction in direct financing.",
        "Another member commented that, although judging from economic conditions and prospects at home and abroad some scope seemed to have arisen for more accommodative monetary policy, it was necessary to further observe and examine the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident and risk factors such as the appreciation of the Korean won, since the overall trend of macroeconomic variables remained unchanged even in the revised economic outlook.",
        "One other member noted that the Korean won had appreciated by more than 6% against the US dollar since March of this year, having at one point in July reached 1,008 won to the dollar, and that it was even appreciating against the currencies of Japan and the euro area, with which Korea runs bilateral current account deficits, as Korea’s trade surplus with China, which accounts for 70 to 80% of Korea’s current account surplus, is converted and flows into the Korean FX market mostly in US dollars.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that, as the recently agreed upon establishment of markets for direct trade between the won and the yuan was expected to mitigate this excessive appreciation of the won, efforts to facilitate these markets were necessary.",
        "Another member observed meanwhile that the uncertainties concerning the future growth path of and the downside risks to the economy were judged to have increased, while prices were seen likely to continue showing a rate of growth below the inflation target.",
        "He went on to argue that, although predicting in advance whether the impact of the Sewol ferry accident would be long-term or only temporary was difficult, the Base Rate should be adjusted downward from its current level this month, since a preemptive response was judged necessary at this juncture owing to concerns about the decline in economic agents’ confidence becoming prolonged.",
        "Taking into consideration the results of their earlier discussions, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a rate cut.",

        "despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product prices as the decline in petroleum product prices accelerated.",
        "Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 2.2% to 2.1%.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although inflationary pressures appear to be somewhat weaker than previously expected.",

        "However, some members noted that there were also destabilizing factors such as the possibility of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.",
        "While the majority of members generally assessed the international financial markets as having maintained stable movements, many members also mentioned destabilizing factors in financial markets, including the intensification of the Japanese yen’s weakening trend and financial unrest in some emerging market countries.",
        "As to the domestic economy, most members’ assessment was that, based on improvements in various indexes, it was maintaining its recovery.",
        "They forecast that the economy would continue to grow at its potential growth rate, driven largely by improved domestic demand including consumption and investment and uptrends in exports.",
        "With regard to domestic financial markets, members pointed out that long-term market rates had declined due mainly to foreigners’ net buying of Treasury bond futures and stock prices had also fallen affected by outflows of foreign investment funds driven largely by the weakening yen and concerns about a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.",
        "One member argued that effective measures needed to be developed in advance against market destabilizing factors such as the expanded scale of in- and outflows of foreign investment funds, the spread of the restructuring at some ailing English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "large corporations and the exacerbation of household debt problems caused by higher market interest rates.",
        "As to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had registered a low level of just above 1 percent, due mainly to a fall in agricultural product prices.",
        "They forecast though that downward pressures on the demand side would gradually weaken and that the movements of agricultural product prices, house rents and public utility fees would act as upward pressures.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, taking overall account economic conditions at home and abroad and the future outlook, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member, while noting that there still was a possibility of international financial market volatility heightening with monetary policies in major advanced countries diverging, expressed the opinion that it would be better to keep a close watch on the monetary policy implementation by major advanced countries and the movements of international financial market price variables going forward, while closely monitoring their influence on the domestic economy.",
        "Another member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that going forward every effort should be made to achieve in a balanced manner policy goals such as supporting the recovery of growth trend, achieving the medium-term inflation target and promoting financial stability, as set out in the Monetary Policy Direction for 2014 released at the end of 2013.",
        "One other member took the view that it was time to take active policy measures since it is possible that domestic long-term market interest rates could exhibit an upward trend as it synchronize with US long-term Treasury bond yields, and since interest rate and exchange rate volatility were expected to intensify in line with the heightened volatility of capital in- and outflows.",
        "He went on to comment that, since there was concern that the trend of the yen’s depreciation might continue for a considerable time going forward and thus have a negative impact on Japan’s neighboring countries, measures through international cooperation would be necessary so that the yen’s depreciation did not become excessive.",
        "While calling for a close watch to be kept on the continued weakness of yen and the spreading out of the its effects, the concerns about slowing Chinese growth, increased financial market volatility and the likelihood of a tapering off of the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, one member expressed the opinion that the effects of monetary and fiscal policies be examined so as to ensure that the trends of low growth and low inflation did not become entrenched while the monitoring of destabilizing factors in the foreign exchange market should be strengthened.",
        "He added that attention should be paid to financial system disrupting factors including the possibility of a deterioration in fund-raising conditions for vulnerable sectors, the sector-specific debt situation including the household debt problem, and financial market unrest arising largely from the steepening of the yield curve.",
        "In addition, one member called for the close monitoring of future developments in financial market conditions at home and abroad and develop appropriate measures to various scenarios, since the heightened possibility that the intensification of yen’s weakening trend would have a major negative impact on the stability and growth of the Korean economy going forward and since contrasting policy stances in the US and Japan are especially expected to greatly increase the volatility in highly open Korean financial markets.",
        "Last, another member noted the need to look into the possibility of further weakening of the yen and the influences of its intensified depreciation on the Korean won, and expressed the opinion that it is time to focus policy capacity on revitalizing corporate sector investment as a growth engine that would allow the Korean economy to emerge from its low growth trend.",
        "He went on to express the view that, with regard to steady rising overseas investment, it was essential to evaluate in detail the future influence of overseas corporate investment on the dynamism of domestic demand, and that attention should be paid to the declining share of fixed-rate lending in overall household debt.",

        "Members meanwhile assessed the international financial markets as having remained stable overall, despite a temporary contraction due mainly to risks related to the Ukraine and to worries about an economic slowdown in China.",
        "Some members noted that risk factors did still remain, however, including the additional reductions in scale of asset purchases by the US Fed and the possibility of expansions in financial unrest in emerging market countries.",

        "He went on to state the views that, as the appreciation of the US dollar was forecast to continue in the future, and the depreciations of the yen and the euro to intensify, measures should be developed to stabilize any excessive exchange rate fluctuations, and that, as the negative effects of the continued situation of low inflation might gradually increase, coping with this low inflation had to be considered as one of the most important policy tasks.",
        "Another member noted that the trends of improvements in economic activities in major countries other than the US were weak overall, that the momentum of the domestic economic recovery was not strong, that uncertainties in the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets were mounting, and that the downside risks to growth perceived by economic agents were rising.",
        "He then expressed the view that, although the Base Rate should be kept at its current level this month, there was a need to manage financial and foreign exchange market volatilities so as to prevent their growing excessive, while strengthening communication with the aim of easing the uncertainties due to changes in economic conditions and restoring economic agents’ confidence.",
        "One other member stated his opinion that the benefits of an additional Base Rate adjustment were not large compared to the potential risks, considering the points that, with the effects of the Base Rate cuts and domestic and foreign downside risks coexisting uncertainties as to the size of the negative output gap and the speed of its closure were high, while there was also a high degree of uncertainty as to the future path of the price gap as the directions of changes in the CPI and in core inflation were showing different pictures, that considering the monetary policy time lag there was a need to closely monitor the influence of the two recent Base Rate cuts, that the current credit cycle was being judged as not in a phase of overheating in which systemic risk had increased due to an excessive expansion in debt, and that outflows of foreign investment funds due to narrowing of the spread between foreign and domestic interest rates following the Base Rate cuts were still not large, and so it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month while keeping close watch on the effects of the Base Rate cuts made until now and on changes in the macroeconomy and in risks to financial stability.",
        "He went on to note then that, since the degrees of concern voiced by some related to the recent weakening of the yen and to the possibility of deflation exceeded the realities, active communication with market participants and the general public was necessary, based upon the results of objective and neutral analyses regarding these risk factors.",
        "One other member put forward the view that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month.",
        "He then noted that the depreciation of the yen had been accelerating of late and that some forecasters expected the Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate to reach the depreciation accelerates as it was now doing, the negative effects on Korean firms’ competitiveness could increase to a level that could scarcely be ignored, and vigilance in this regard should thus not be relaxed.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, although signs of improvement in domestic economic and price conditions were not clear, while uncertainties had increased due mainly to the contraction in economic sentiment and the intensification of Japanese yen weakening, it would be better to maintain the Base Rate at its present level for the month since the effects of the government’s economic measures and the Base Rate cuts had not been fully reflected in the real economy, due mainly to the related time lags, and there was thus a need to monitor future developments a bit more.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the prolongation of economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks.",
        "- In Korea, the Committee judges that exports have sustained a favorable pattern, that indicators of domestic demand have been alternating between improvements and worsening, and that economic agents’ sentiments have been sluggish.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, albeit at a moderate pace.",
        "- Consumer price inflation rose from 1.1% the month before to 1.2% in October, due mainly to a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.8%, from 1.9% in September, owing primarily to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase.",
        "The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low for the time being, inflation will gradually rise next year.",
        "In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued their uptrends.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, the Korean won has depreciated considerably against the US dollar but appreciated significantly against the Japanese yen, in line with the US dollar’s strength globally and with the Japanese yen’s weakness due mainly to the expansion of the Bank of Japan’s quantitative and qualitative monetary easing.",
        "Stock prices have rebounded, after having fallen significantly due for example to concerns about the slowdown of the global economy and to outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds.",
        "Long-term interest rates have declined.",
        "- Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as the trends of household debt and of capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, many members’ assessment was that the moderate trend of recovery led by advanced countries had been sustained, with the pace of growth in the US accelerating.",
        "Members also noted that, although the international financial markets showed generally favorable movements, volatility had risen somewhat since the end of July, influenced for instance by concerns about an early interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and by the emergence of geopolitical risks.",
        "As to the domestic economy, many members commented that, although production indicators had shown partial improvements, the recovery of domestic demand as evident from consumption and facilities investment appeared feeble, while indicators of economic agents’ sentiment had deteriorated.",
        "Some members expressed concerns about the possibility of this worsening of economic agents’ sentiment operating as a factor restraining the trend of growth going forward, mainly by reducing consumption.",
        "One member noted that growth remained dependent upon overseas demand while the trend of recovery in domestic demand was weak, and that it was possibile that the negative domestic demand gap, which has an even greater influence on prices and employment, had actually widened recently.",
        "Regarding employment, meanwhile, one member noted that, despite a recent increase in the number of persons employed qualitative improvements in the employment situation had been limited, with the increase having centered around the older age groups, the service on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "sector and part-time employment.",
        "Another member argued that the unemployment gap relative to the natural rate of unemployment was high, and that there was also labor market slack in terms of working hours, as the share in total persons employed of those working less than 35 hours per week was high and average weekly working hours had been on a constant decline.",
        "In the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that the expectations of a BOK Base Rate cut had risen, long- and short-term interest rates had fallen, and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar.",
        "With regard to prices, members mentioned that consumer price inflation stood at 1.6%, a slight decrease from the previous month, and anticipated that it would remain at a low level for the time being given the low demand-pull pressures and the pressures from appreciation of the Korean won.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member noted that now was the moment when providing some momentum for the restoration of confidence was necessary, since the pace of economic recovery was judged to be still unsatisfactory and the economic slowdown had become prolonged, due particularly to a massive weakening in confidence of economic agents, while prices were seen likely to sustain a low rate of increase below the inflation target for the time being.",
        "The same member went on to state an opinion that, although there was a need to cut the Base Rate from its current level, it would be better to depart from the existing method of cutting it in 25 basis point steps, by lowering it instead by 20 basis points to 2.30%, since account should be taken of the need for ensuring room for Base Rate adjustments in response to future uncertainties, of the limited effect of an additional rate cut in the current somewhat accommodative financial circumstances, and of the spread between domestic and overseas interest rates, which exerts an influence on capital flows.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, although it was desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, particular attention should be paid to communication so as to avoid the formation of one-sided market expectations, since there was only a limited possibility of further monetary easing given that the Base Rate cut and the government measures to revitalize domestic demand would likely contribute to a strengthening of the economic recovery, that the possibility could not be ruled out of the Base Rate cut, together with the easing of the LTV and DTI regulations, increasing households’ debt burdens, and that the possibility remained of the US Fed raising interest rates early.",
        "One other member argued that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, as the expected positive effects of the Base Rate cut — including the steadying of the trends of narrowing of the negative output and the inflation gaps, the prevention of a further increase in the imbalances between domestic and overseas demand due to export-dependent growth, and the blocking the decline in economic sentiment from becoming firmly entrenched — would outweigh the negative factors involved such as the household debt risk, the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the US Fed, and worsening financial institution profitability due to interest rate cuts.",
        "He went on to advocate the view that, going forward, while closely monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut on macroeconomy and financial stability, it would be appropriate to secure a neutral monetary policy stance to allow policy flexibility on both the upward and the downward sides.",
        "Another member commented that, while lowering the Base Rate by weakening consumer and investor sentiments, it was necessary to pay attention to ensure that factors threatening financial stability, such as an increase in household debt and a delay in corporate restructuring, did not materialize, and to closely examine the effects of changes in global financial market conditions resulting from any shift in the US monetary policy stance.",
        "This member went on to state that it was necessary to encourage financial institutions to manage household debt in a stable manner at their own initiative and to pursue soundness in their operations, so that the loosening of housing finance regulations and the easing of monetary policy could achieve their intended effects without undermining financial stability.",
        "Another member also noted that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and added that although this downward adjustment was expected to contribute to easing the sluggishness of the Korean economy and to enhancing its stability, there were concerns that policy costs might be incurred, such as delays in restructuring and an expansion in household debt, and that the policy authorities should therefore devote efforts to minimizing such costs.",
        "He added that, as the Base Rate was being cut in parallel with the easing of the LTV and DTI regulations to normalize the housing market, it would be advisable to closely monitor the real estate market in the future, and to make the required preparations for implementing macroprudential measures if needed.",
        "One other member commented that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 2.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "He expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to change the current monetary policy stance, since the downward revision of the growth forecast for this year, to 3.8%, had been due to a temporary shock, and so there was little need for short-term economic stimulation, while the current growth rate did not turn out unsatisfactory compared with the potential growth rate, now estimated at around the middle- to upper-3% range.",
        "He went on to note that, in the current situation in which Korean corporations were avoiding investment despite their abundant retained income reserves, a Base Rate cut could not necessarily guarantee an increase in corporate investment and would instead reduce the incomes of households, the majority of which are net creditors, and thereby lower household consumption, which he added could be out of step with the government’s policy stance of returning corporate profits to households so as to boost consumption.",
        "Regarding the inflation target, meanwhile, the same member mentioned that, considering that consumer price inflation was projected to be below its target this year, at 1.9 percent, and since this low inflation was likely to continue for a considerable time in line with the global trend of low inflation, and that most advanced countries including the US set their inflation targets at the 2 percent level while, among emerging market countries, countries such as Thailand and China set theirs at from 0.5 to 3 percent and 3.5 percent respectively, Korea’s current inflation target of of adjusting the inflation target range downward slightly and widening it to 1 percent above or below its mid-point from the year 2015 on.",
        "He added meanwhile that, rather than resetting the inflation target every three years as was currently done, it would be advisable to determine a target without the setting of a specific period for it unless there were particular reasons to do so.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the discussions held earlier, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "Moon, Woosik, however, expressed clear opposition to the idea of lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for holding it at its current level.",
        "today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.50% to that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the euro area economic recovery still appears weak, while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries and by geopolitical risks.",
        "Committee judges that improvements in domestic demand, which had contracted due mainly to the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident, have been insufficient, and that the consumption and investment sentiments of economic agents also continue to show sluggishness.",
        "On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although its pace of narrowing will be moderate.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation fell from 1.7% the month before to 1.6% in July, due mainly to increases in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to will gradually rise, but judges that for the time being inflationary pressures will not be high.",
        "Housing prices in the country excluding Seoul and its surrounding areas showed a slight upward movement, while leasehold deposit prices both in Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued their modest uptrends.",
        "owing chiefly to the government’s announcement of economic policies, stock prices have fallen back somewhat due for example to geopolitical risks.",
        "The Korean won has depreciated under the influence of the US dollar’s strength globally, and long-term market interest rates have fallen.",
        "to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the recovery of economic growth.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, changes in economic agents’ sentiment and movements of future economic indicators including the household debt trend, while observing the effects of this month’s Base Rate cut and the government’s economic policies."

    "2022": [
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (November 2022),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that domestic economic growth was weakening due to sluggish exports resulting from economic slowdowns in major trading partners and the downturn of the IT industry.",
        "Meanwhile, some members expected that, although domestic demand had sustained growth so far based on favorable private consumption and robust employment, its growth for next year would likely fall short of its potential level, with consumption limited by a decrease in real household incomes following rising interest rates and high inflation and also by the negative wealth effect caused by falling housing prices.",
        "Members assessed that inflation remained high, with consumer price inflation standing at the upper-5% level and core inflation and inflation expectations among the general public at the lower-4% level, boosted by the acceleration of the rise in processed food prices and the hike in electricity and gas fees, more than offsetting the slowing growth in petroleum product prices.",
        "Meanwhile, some members expressed the view that, although inflation had recently slowed somewhat and some inflation indicators, such as weighted median core inflation and short-term inflation expectations, had been improving, there still were high uncertainties including possible economic slowdowns at home and abroad and a buildup of upward pressures on public utility fees.",
        "In terms of financial stability, members also assessed that, thanks to market stabilization measures by the government and the Bank of Korea, domestic financial market instability had eased somewhat, with Korean Treasury bond yields and the won-dollar exchange rate falling significantly.",
        "Meanwhile, some members emphasized that, amid a liquidity crunch in the US Treasury market and the continued reduction in global banks’ credit supply, attention should be paid to liquidity risks following a deterioration in international financial market conditions.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "With respect to the global economy, the member noted that growth was slowing across major countries, due to combined effects of various factors such as ongoing policy rate hike stances and disruptions of the energy supply, with inflation remaining high.",
        "The member saw that, in the US in particular, the rate hikes so far appeared to have begun to influence the real economy, with the Institute for Supply Management the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowing, despite an increase in retail sales.",
        "The member expected the US to enter into an economic downturn after the end of this year.",
        "The member mentioned that, while CPI in the US was significantly higher than its target, it was falling from its previous high.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that some real indicators were showing mixed signals, just like those in the US, with private consumption remaining relatively strong, the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowing, and manufacturing production, service production and exports showing sluggishness.",
        "The member forecast that, as the impacts of the policy rate hikes so far on prices of some assets, such as housing and stocks, had already materialized, the impacts would be seen across the entire real economy next year, which would lead to growth running slightly below the potential level.",
        "The member saw that, while the labor market remained strong overall, the number of persons gaining employment next year would be merely one tenth of this year’s figure, due to the gradual impact of the economic slowdown.",
        "The member forecast that core inflation would be lower than initially expected (August) next year, due mainly to the weakening of demand-side inflationary pressures in line with the economic slowdown, as well as to slower labor demand, but deceleration in core inflation would be moderate.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that, in the FX market, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, which had risen significantly, fell sharply, in line with improvement in investor sentiment, driven by expectations of an adjustment to the pace of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "However, in the domestic financial market, the member noted that credit risk aversion remained high and there was a liquidity crunch with CD and corporate bond spreads and CP rates increasing significantly.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to a possibility of a small shock combined with year-end factors leading to heightened volatility in the entire market.",
        "The member found it desirable to maintain the monetary policy tightening stance to respond to the underlying uptrend in inflation, but saw that it would be necessary to slow down the pace of tightening.",
        "First, the member assessed that external uncertainties had increased slightly.",
        "The member saw that inflation in the US had passed its peak, and expected tightening to be less intense, but last longer, given movements toward a slowdown in the real economy and upward revisions to the terminal federal funds rate.",
        "The member presented the opinion that domestic financial and economic conditions could be affected through various channels in the course of a decline in global dollar liquidity.",
        "The member stated that rapid rate hikes could stimulate vulnerability in the entire financial system, since in the internal sector, the degree of conflict between financial market stability and price stability was more severe than initially expected due to rising real estate prices which had been built up for years.",
        "The member stated that, as an open economy with a possibility of capital outflows in line with domestic and overseas conditions, Korea could suffer from various side effects if the space for tightening was exhausted due to domestic financial stability issues.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that, given this point, it would be necessary to decide the pace of tightening cautiously going forward, examining the effect of Base Rate hikes so far and keeping a close watch on the developments of factors causing domestic and overseas uncertainties.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation was the foremost factor considered in the Base Rate decision this time.",
        "The member took the view that, as consumer price inflation had been exceeding its medium-term target of 2% for a long period of time, it would be necessary to place the top priority on inflation in monetary policy operations until a clear change in the trend of consumer price inflation is confirmed.",
        "The member noted that, although the contribution of petroleum product prices to inflation had decreased, consumer price inflation had remained high in the mid- to upper-5% range due to secondary effects in which the contributions of prices of industrial products excluding petroleum products and of electricity, gas and water charges had increased.",
        "The member added that core inflation and inflation expectations among the general public remained in the lower-4% range.",
        "The member assessed that the fast pace of inflation had been slowing recently and some underlying inflation indicators had been rising at slower paces, but more time was needed to confirm a shift in the trend.",
        "The member expressed concerns that there were highly complicated shocks affecting inflation, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s lockdown measure, and that it was highly uncertain how long each of the shocks would last.",
        "As for other considerations with regard to inflation in future Base Rate decisions, the member mentioned the time lag with which rate hikes are transmitted, the speed of disinflation, and the economic situation for next year.",
        "The member forecast that rate hikes, which had begun in August last year, would have more evident effects on consumer price inflation next year.",
        "The member also assessed that, once a change in the inflation trend is confirmed, it would be necessary to conduct monetary policy with more weight on the real economy and financial stability while looking at the speed of disinflation and economic conditions.",
        "The member argued that the second major factor was financial stability, stressing the need to maintain the monetary tightening stance while examining whether the market would be able to tolerate it at this point in time.",
        "The member however emphasized that it would be necessary to choose appropriately among interest rate-focused monetary policy instruments in response to inflation and among market stabilization measures in pursuit of financial stability that would be fit for the situation and purpose.",
        "The member presented the view that the recent events in the financial markets and the BOK’s market stabilization measures in response were good examples.",
        "The member stressed that market interest rates had recently risen to an unintended high level in reflection of expectations of the level of the terminal rate and credit risk aversion in response to a series of recent events, and went on to emphasize the need to understand that such a huge scale of increase in market rates had been attributable to a mix of the monetary authorities’ intention and widening spreads resulting from financial instability and supply-demand factors.",
        "The member mentioned that the BOK’s recent measures had been taken in an effort to reverse the portion of the rise in the interest rate which had not been intended by its monetary policy measures and thereby facilitate transmission channels that were currently centered on interest rates, and went on to state that the central bank’s two policy goals had been complementary rather than in conflict.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the member stressed the need to closely monitor the financial markets and take preemptive measures if necessary to ensure that the central bank’s rate hike stance in response to inflation and measures to cope with financial instability would not conflict with each other.",
        "The member added that the BOK should also play a role as market maker if needed, as well as conduct interest rate-focused monetary policy.",
        "The member however noted that this kind of policy intervention required careful judgment of the timing of intervention and the relevant circumstances.",
        "The member mentioned that acting sooner and more quickly would help avoid a situation in which too-frequent interventions could affect expectations and incentives of market participants, resulting in the distortion of the functioning of market principles and an endogenous increase in tail risks, consequently causing an even bigger crisis.",
        "The member argued that the central bank should assure the markets that it stood ready to intervene whenever needed and that its interventions would not be made mechanically but would be made depending on the situations in an effort not to distort market principles.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that global economic growth had been slowing and US dollar liquidity had been decreasing.",
        "The member also mentioned that, in response to high inflation caused by a combination of excessive liquidity and global supply problems in the course of recovery from the pandemic, central banks worldwide had been hiking interest rates at fast paces, enduring economic contractions.",
        "The member presented the view that inflationary pressures seemed to have eased somewhat recently, affected by the easing of global supply disruptions, slowing growth in international oil, commodity and grain prices, and monetary tightening by countries around the world, but that it was too early to conclude that inflation had fully stabilized.",
        "The member evaluated that domestic economic growth had also been weakening.",
        "The member mentioned that the momentum of recovery in private consumption that had been suppressed during the pandemic remained, but it had been slowing influenced by weakening real purchasing power owing to rate hikes and high inflation, and that exports had also been slowing rapidly due to economic slowdowns in major trading partners, the downturn of the IT industry and the base-period effect from last year’s export boom.",
        "The member assessed that new facilties investment had been shrinking due to the economic slowdown and the risk of rising costs and that growth in construction investment had slowed affected by a slowdown in housing market activities.",
        "The member stressed that consumer price inflation seemed to have peaked in August in line with a slowdown in growth of import and producer prices since the spring of this year, but considering the impact of hikes in electricity and gas fees, high inflation expectations and the high rate of growth in fixed wages of permanent workers both of which stood at the 4 percent range, the interactions between these two indicators, and a possible rebound in international commodity prices and the exchange rate, caution was still required with respect to the possible persistence of high inflation.",
        "The member also expressed the view that structural changes, including the emergence of a new Cold War era, the rearrangement of global supply chains, the pursuit of new economic security and order, climate change, and population ageing, presented a question whether a rapid return to low inflation and low interest rates would be possible.",
        "The member assessed that the financial markets had shown some signs of a financial crunch and credit risk aversion had heightened since October, but that overall investor sentiment seemed to have improved somewhat recently.",
        "The member however stressed that attention should be kept on ongoing uncertainties including a possible worsening of US dollar funding conditions due to the reduction in global liquidity, liquidity risks at some securities and construction companies owing to the shrinking of the real estate market, continued large-scale bond issuances by public corporations such as KEPCO, and short-term financial market instability.",
        "The member took the view that credit and leverage, having expanded excessively under the low interest rate environment, would inevitably go through corrections, as re-evaluation of high-risk asset prices had started in line with a shift in the monetary policy stance.",
        "The member mentioned that the Bank of Korea should conduct monetary policy, setting its priority as maintaining price stability while paying attention to financial stability as well.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, while deleveraging of private debt had occurred occasionally in major countries since 2005, such deleveraging had rarely occurred in Korea, resulting in high financial market vulnerability which, combined with persistently high inflation, put the central bank in a situation in which it had to make more difficult monetary policy decisions than ever.",
        "The member noted that a stronger monetary tightening stance could add to financial market instability but, given the persistence of inflation, the forecast path of US rate hikes, the downward trend of global dollar liquidity, and foreign exchange supply and demand pressures stemming from the outlooks for the current and capital accounts, an easing of monetary tightening in the current situation could not be an appropriate solution and could rather cause further financial instability through the FX channel.",
        "The member presented the view that the only possible measure at this time seemed to be enduring a certain degree of instability in the financial market and going through corrections in the real estate market and in the financial sector while preventing this from developing into a systemic crisis.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member saw that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that it seemed necessary to maintain the rate hike stance for some time and that the size and pace of future rate hikes should be determined in comprehensive consideration of economic and inflation trends, financial market conditions, monetary policies in major countries, and the impacts of previous rate hikes.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member commented that the domestic economy was not deviating significantly from its potential level yet.",
        "The member added that, while export growth was slowing, private consumption showed sound growth, and facilities investment had improved of late, led by the IT sector.",
        "The member stated that labor market conditions in particular were continuing to show favorable movements.",
        "The member projected that the domestic economic growth would remain at a lower level than initially expected, affected mainly by the global economic slowdown and the worsening of financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The member also assessed that downside risks appeared to be high.",
        "On the inflation side, the member stated that consumer price inflation had remained high in the upper-5% range.",
        "The member noted that with the impacts of a larger increase in prices of processed food, and increases in electricity and gas fees acting as upward pressures, underlying inflation including core inflation had accelerated due to the spread of the uptrend in prices to personal service items.",
        "Accordingly, the member added that inflation expectations remained at a high level above 4%.",
        "The member presented the view that the pace of decline in consumer prices could slow, given accumulated upward pressures on public utility fees, and highly persistent underlying inflation.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member evaluated that the liquidity burden of financial institutions had increased since September, due to surges in market interest rates at home and abroad, and the Korean won to the US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member noted that the Legoland incident had triggered instability in the market for commercial paper (CP) with credit risk aversion heightening and transactions slowing down.",
        "However, the member stated that market liquidity conditions had improved, thanks to the market stabilization measures by the government and the Bank of Korea, and instability in the market so far had been mostly contained, thanks to expectations of an adjustment to the pace of monetary policy tightening at home and abroad of late.",
        "The member judged that, while yields on project financing asset-backed commercial paper (PF-ABCP) still remained high, this mainly came from concerns about default on project financing loans in line with a slowdown in the real estate market, and was not a problem facing the entire credit market.",
        "In the foreign exchange sector, the member noted that the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had stabilized greatly to the mid-1,300 won-to-dollar range of late and foreign currency liquidity conditions also remained favorable overall.",
        "However, the member saw that liquidity in the US Treasury market had worsened recently, and global banks’ credit supply was declining.",
        "The member went on to present the view that if the tightening stances of the US Federal Reserve and the ECB continued going forward, dollar liquidity conditions in the global financial market would likely worsen further.",
        "The member commented that, since a significant portion of Korean investors making overseas portfolio investment raised foreign currency funds through short-term FX swaps, attention should be paid to the relevant liquidity risks stemming from the worsening of international financial market conditions going forward.",
        "The member took the view that, in overall consideration of growth, price and financial conditions of the Korean economy, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate hike stance to respond to underlying sources of inflationary pressures, while taking microeconomic stabilizing measures to deal with market unrest.",
        "The member noted that it would be necessary to maintain the Base Rate hike stance for some time, as there were many uncertainties surrounding the price path, and the FX market could become unstable again depending on the pace of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member commented that increased leverage through short-term funding through non-bank financial institutions in particular was hidden behind an instability in some short-term money market and liquidity risks in the international financial market.",
        "The member went on to take the view that, given this point, it would be necessary to respond in a timely manner to prevent potential liquidity risks in the domestic and overseas financial markets from spreading to the entire financial system, as well as to manage risks through de-leveraging and restructuring.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that global economic growth had been weakening significantly due to steep rate hikes by the US and other major countries at a time when energy supply-demand instability was not yet resolved.",
        "The member mentioned that global inflation meanwhile had remained high in most countries, and European countries in particular.",
        "The member assessed that, concerning the Korean economy, domestic demand had continued to expand based on favorable private consumption and employment until the third quarter and consumer price inflation had remained high.",
        "The member mentioned that, although inflationary pressures had been easing somewhat recently, inflation had become prolonged while supply shocks had spread across the economy and indicators for core inflation and inflation expectations were all deviating from the inflation target by more than 200 basis points.",
        "The member argued that inflation was forecast to remain above its target next year, suggesting that there was room for further tightening.",
        "The member however mentioned that the stage had been passed where vigilance against further inflationary pressures was required.",
        "The member expected that, although households’ excess savings that had increased during the pandemic period had led to brisk face-to-face consumption activities since the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, consumption capacities would decrease rapidly among households faced with increased financial burdens.",
        "The member forecast that falling housing prices would lead to negative wealth effects, and a decrease in borrowings due to high interest rates and a decline in real incomes in line with high inflation would limit consumption.",
        "The member noted that household incomes had already started to decrease in the previous quarter due to the economic slowdown and that, according to Statistics Korea’s household income and expenditure survey, real household incomes for the third quarter this year had declined by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 2.8% year on year.",
        "The member added that, looking at the SNA statistics, seasonally-adjusted GDP had increased by power, had declined owing to the worsening terms of trade.",
        "The member meanwhile expressed the opinion that fiscal expenditure based on a consolidated fiscal balance basis had risen by 11%, contributing much to growth in domestic demand, but that it was projected to decline by around 2% in 2023, acting as another factor easing aggregate demand-pull pressures.",
        "The member noted that the rate hikes, which had begun 15 months ago, had started to take evident effect particularly in the real estate and financial markets, and went on to state that the corporate bond and short-term money markets had become unstable amid the over-concentration of capital in safe haven assets such as time deposits.",
        "The member emphasized that such financial instability could be temporary and confined to a certain part of the economy, but since the possibility of a spread of such instability could not be ruled out, caution would be required in raising the Base Rate.",
        "The member presented the view that the excessive shrinkage of investor sentiment toward risky assets was not irrelevant to monetary tightening and that a forecast of a continued tightening stance for a considerable period of time seemed to be also responsible for such contraction.",
        "The member argued that, even though the decision was made in careful consideration of inflation still far exceeding its target, the stage had been passed where vigilance against further inflationary pressures was required, and that, since a slowdown in households’ real incomes and purchasing power had become apparent and it was necessary to monitor developments of financial instability and their effects, a very careful approach should be taken to further rate hikes.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.25% from the current 3.00% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that economic growth in major countries was slowing rapidly due to ongoing high inflation and monetary policy tightening stances.",
        "The member projected that, although demand at home and abroad was weakening, led by exports and investment, price growth would slow moderately, due mainly to a sustained second round of spillover effects and additional increases in electricity and gas fees.",
        "Looking at an adjusted projection by the Research Department, the member expected that the growth gap would turn negative, while the inflation gap would remain in positive territory.",
        "As for the labor market, the member projected that, while wages, and those of regular employees in particular, were continuing to grow and the unemployment rate remained low, the increase in the number of persons employed would decline gradually, due mainly to the economic slowdown and base effects.",
        "Meanwhile, in the external sector, the member evaluated that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions had improved greatly, as a soar in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had been reversed, and overseas securities investment by residents and foreign portfolio investment in Korea had shifted to net inflows.",
        "However, concerning the domestic financial market, the member commented that the CP market crunch had intensified and issuance conditions for credit bonds, such as corporate bonds and credit-specialized financial business company bonds, had worsened due to the Legoland shock on top of accumulated financial risks related to real estate project financing.",
        "The member judged that, from the perspective of monetary policy, these recent changes in economic and financial conditions made trade-offs among policy objectives, such as economic activity, inflation and financial stability, grow further.",
        "The member particularly stated that trade-offs between internal financial stability and external financial stability appeared to have intensified, due to rapid deterioration in domestic credit market conditions against the backdrop of the potential risk of instability in the FX sector stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s rapid rate hikes.",
        "However, the member found it appropriate to focus on price stability and maintain the stance of rate hikes this time in light of the fact that consumer price inflation still remained high in the upper-5% range and was forecast to remain elevated at 4% or higher until the first half of next year.",
        "However, the member judged that, given the output gap would turn negative next year and instability in some financial markets had worsened, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, a smaller hike than that in the previous Monetary Policy Board meeting.",
        "The member took the view that, going forward, it would be necessary to prioritize price stability in the conduct of monetary policy until the underlying slowing trend in inflation was entrenched.",
        "However, the member expected the Board to reduce the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate, while monitoring domestic and overseas economic developments and financial stability conditions, if the current forecast continued to hold that there would be a pattern of high price growth in the first half and low growth in the latter half and core inflation excluding electricity and gas fees would decline to the 2% range after the second half.",
        "Meanwhile, the member presented the view that various microeconomic policy measures should be used supplementally to deal with unstable financial conditions caused by interactions between the recent rapid rate hikes and accumulated financial imbalances.",
        "The member stated that the Bank of Korea had implemented various market stabilization measures by expanding the range of securities eligible as collateral and purchasing RPs from securities companies to deal with a crunch in the short-term money market after end-October.",
        "The member judged that this market-maker role had been helpful to ease a liquidity crunch in the short-term money market and improve unstable market sentiment.",
        "The member noted that financial unrest could spread, as seen in unrest in the asset-backed securities market and the shrinkage of the credit bond market, as a slowdown in the real estate market and the weakening of investor sentiment would continue for some time.",
        "The member thus stressed the need for a proper policy mix, while closely monitoring relevant developments.",
        "However, the member commented that the recent unstable financial conditions were unavoidable in that they arose out of the process of adjusting shadow banking which had expanded excessively against the backdrop of the past low interest rate environment and favorable real estate market.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to preventing the expansion of moral hazard, as well as to ensuring that the Bank of Korea would not play a quasi-fiscal role excessively.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.00% to 3.25%.",
        "The Board judges that the policy response to ensure price stability should be continued as inflation has remained high.",
        "The size of the Base Rate hike was judged to be appropriate at 25bp, in overall consideration of the easing of risks in the foreign exchange sector and the contraction of short-term financial markets, while the economic slowdown is expected to be greater than forecast in August.",
        "- Currently available information suggests that the global economic slowdown has continued, affected by the high inflation, ongoing policy rate hikes in major countries and the prolonged Ukraine crisis.",
        "In global financial markets, the US dollar has weakened and long-term market interest rates have fallen, as risk aversion has partly subsided on the expectations of an adjustment to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, and geopolitical risks.",
        "- Domestic economic growth has continued to slow with exports shifting to a decrease, although private consumption has maintained its recovery trend.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to be favorable with a low unemployment rate, despite a slowing increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to weaken, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates.",
        "GDP growth for this year will be consistent with the August forecast of 2.6%, but that for next year is projected to be 1.7%, considerably lower than the August forecast of 2.1%.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has remained high at 5.7% in October due to increases in electricity and gas fees and the accelerating price increases in processed food products, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have moderated.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high at the lower-4% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will somewhat decrease due to the base effect and the economic slowdown, but will remain high at the 5% level for some time.",
        "Consumer price inflation is projected to be 5.1% in 2022 and rates and global oil prices, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the size of increases of electricity and gas fees.",
        "- In the financial and foreign exchange markets, the long-term Korean Treasury bond yield and Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have decreased and stock prices have risen due to expectations of an adjustment to the pace of monetary tightening in major countries.",
        "However, in the short-term financial markets, yields on project financing asset-backed commercial paper (PF-ABCP) have risen significantly and their transactions have shrunk.",
        "Household loans have increased only slightly and housing prices have further decreased in all parts of the country.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted for some time, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed.",
        "In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, monetary policy changes in major countries, financial stability conditions, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, although consumption had slowed due to growing uncertainties stemming from the spread of COVID-19 variants, the resurgence of the pandemic was having limited impacts on consumption, thanks to expanded vaccinations and learning effects of economic agents.",
        "Members expected the underlying trend of economic recovery to continue, as exports would show their solid trend of increase, and the recovery of private consumption would pick up again, bolstered by changes in consumption patterns and by expanded government policy measures to provide income support.",
        "Meanwhile, a member anticipated that growth in the first half of this year could be more sluggish than expected due to the spread of the Omicron variant, with slower growth in China and changes in US monetary policy possibly acting as downside pressures on growth.",
        "In terms of inflation, members expected consumer price inflation for this year to far exceed the November forecast, as inflationary pressures would spread widely and the rate of increase in core inflation would accelerate.",
        "Some members saw that rises in international commodity prices and agricultural and livestock product prices were leading to a second round of spillover effects such as rises in durable goods and dining-out prices.",
        "The members went on to emphasize that a close watch should be kept on the possibility that this would stimulate a rise in inflation expectations and lead to an interaction between prices and inflation expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, members assessed that, amid heightened volatilities in price variables of some financial assets stemming from changes in domestic and international monetary policies and the resurgence of the pandemic, financial conditions remained accommodative.",
        "Members presented the view that there would be a need to guard against the risk of financial imbalances, since corporate lending was showing high growth and there still was much potential household loan demand, despite slower growth in household lending due to the total quantity control on household loans.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to changes in consumption patterns, the impacts of monetary policy normalization in major countries on the domestic economy, exchange rate movements, and developments of economic indices moving in concert with GDP.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from its current level of 1.00%, while one member argued that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 1.00%.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current level of 1.00%.",
        "The member forecast that, despite uncertainties related to developments of the Omicron variant and global inflation, and related policy measures, the global economy would maintain a recovery, as seen in the strong growth of world trade.",
        "The member stated that the improvement in private consumption growth had moderated for a while owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions but this would be temporary, and expected that private consumption, along with buoyant exports, would maintain solid growth.",
        "As for the FX and financial sectors, the member judged that volatility of major variables, such as short- and long-term interest rates, the exchange rate and stock prices, had increased slightly affected by the situation related to COVID-19 and changes in expectations of monetary policies, while macroprudential conditions had been favorable at home and abroad.",
        "The member stressed that it was the trends of inflation and inflation expectations that led to the judgment that a rate hike would be appropriate at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the upper-3% level in both November and December and was forecast to continue to run in the 3% range for some time and above the 2% target for the year overall.",
        "The member expected core inflation, currently running at the lower-2% level, to run considerably above 2% this year.",
        "The member mentioned that this upward trend was also seen in underlying inflation indicators.",
        "The member stated that the number of items showing price rises had steadily increased since the second half of last year, suggesting the spread of the uptrend in prices to various items.",
        "The member emphasized that inflation expectations are another variable requiring particular attention.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation expectations of economic agents had grown rapidly amid the recent sustained uptrend in prices.",
        "The member added that inflation expectations of the general public had registered 2.6%, close to the record high of 2.8% registered in January 2017 since the inflation target had been adjusted downward to 2% in 2016, and that inflation expectations of experts had been relatively low but were on the rise and had almost reached 2%.",
        "The member judged that, considering a possible prolongation of inflation due to the interaction between inflation expectations and prices, preemptive measures should be taken to lower inflation expectations to the level the real economy could withstand.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, if nothing is done to keep inflation expectations from rising, this could cause real interest rates to decline, which would require even greater Base Rate hikes and increase negative shocks on the real economy.",
        "The member assessed market liquidity, just as inflation, as remaining excessively high.",
        "The member noted that growth in liquidity indicators, although having slowed recently, remained strong, substantially above the long-term equilibrium level.",
        "The member presented the view that growth in lending to households had slowed owing to the government regulations to control total debt volume and also to a rise in lending rates, but excess demand still existed, and went on to argue that, considering financial institutions’ move to resume their lending at the beginning of the year, it seemed a bit too early to conclude that growth in household lending had stabilized.",
        "The member also noted the concerns that a rate hike in a situation when the economy has not fully returned to its pre-pandemic level could delay the economic recovery.",
        "The member judged that, given the current inflation situation and the strong recovery of the real economy, however, it would be desirable to respond to underlying inflation pressure that had become more pronounced.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current 1.00%.",
        "Looking at the domestic and overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member evaluated that the global economy was continuing its relatively sound recovery trend, as global supply bottlenecks had eased somewhat and the manufacturing sector had begun to improve again.",
        "The member assessed that, although private consumption was slowing again after a rebound in October and November last year, the domestic economy was continuing a trend of recovery, thanks to sustained growth in exports amid strong global demand for Korea’s major export items.",
        "The member saw that, since the rapid spread of the pandemic since December last year had heightened economic uncertainties, it would be necessary to closely monitor the relevant risks.",
        "The member noted that the pandemic was spreading simultaneously across the globe, unlike past waves, and thus its negative impacts could be amplified in the short term and supply chain problems could worsen again depending on the degree to which disease control measures were tightened going forward.",
        "The member pointed out that, in contrast with cases in major advanced economies in which expanded vaccinations were leading to a decline in the fatality rate, the numbers of critically ill patients and deaths in Korea had remained high up until recently.",
        "The member thus raised the concern that the easing of disease control measures at home could be slower than expected.",
        "However, the member was paying close attention to the fact that Omicron, the recent dominant variant, was known to have a relatively low portion of critically ill patients and the correlation between the spread of the pandemic and economic activities had been much lower thanks to the learning effects from past experiences so far and vaccinations.",
        "The member noted that as the public health crisis had persisted for a long time, sectors affected by the disease control measures were gradually shrinking, while consumption of substitute items was increasing.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, if the trend of an easing of disease control measures being followed by a rebound in consumption repeated itself, the recent resurgence of the pandemic would likely to have a limited impact on aggregate demand or the underlying economic trend over the medium to long term horizon.",
        "Meanwhile, the member judged inflationary pressures to have increased more rapidly and broadly than expected.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had risen to inflation diffusion index was rising further.",
        "The member added that, although the uptrend in petroleum product prices had slowed somewhat, thanks to adjustments to international oil prices and fuel tax cuts, the uptrend in core inflation had strengthened due to a sharp increase in sticky prices such as durable goods and dining-out prices.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation for this year to rise from last year demand recovery was continuing, a second-round effect of rising international commodity prices and agricultural and livestock product prices was materializing in full, and housing prices and housing leasehold deposits, both of which had been rising sharply for years, were being reflected after a time gap.",
        "The member cautioned that, since these inflation trends had a tendency to lead to upward pressures on inflation expectations, this could lead to an expansion of monetary accommodation through a decline in the real interest rate, and even work to negatively affect economic stability over the medium- to long-term horizon through interactions with asset prices and wages.",
        "Finally, the member evaluated the financial market to have remained stable overall, although risk appetites had weakened somewhat, due to heightened volatility in price indexes stemming from the evolution of the pandemic, and announcements of monetary policies by major economies.",
        "The member noted that, against this backdrop, since household lending growth had slowed and the rate of housing price increase had also moderated, financial vulnerabilities over the medium-term horizon appeared to have declined slightly.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that, since potential loan demand was estimated to still remain high amid accommodative financial conditions, and banks had been resuming lending from early this year, it would remain to be seen whether these movements would continue going forward.",
        "The member saw that Korea’s household debt-to-income ratio and its household price-to-income ratio (PIR) were higher than those in other countries, due to the accumulation of financial imbalances so far, and the PIR’s disparity from its long-term equilibrium level had widened significantly.",
        "The member thus added that policy efforts to reduce the relevant risks should continue.",
        "Taking all these points into overall consideration, the member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current 1.00%.",
        "The member was still cautious about heightened economic uncertainties related to the rapid spread of the pandemic, but judged that the recent spread of the pandemic was unlikely to weigh on the underlying economic trend, looking at analyses of past developments and cases in major economies for reference.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, since financial conditions remained accommodative and inflationary pressures were increasing more rapidly than expected, concerns about their negative impacts were growing.",
        "The member thus took the view that a decision to further reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation preemptively to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored within the appropriate range and the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances is limited would meet the objectives of policy from a medium- to long-term perspective.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current 1.00%.",
        "The member evaluated that, on the global economic front, economic activities had maintained a trend of recovery and had not contracted greatly, despite the rapid spread of the pandemic led by the Omicron variant.",
        "The member added that expectations for monetary policy normalization in major economies had grown due to increased concern about inflation conditions stemming from global supply bottlenecks and increased demand pressures, and volatility in the international financial market had increased somewhat, influenced by the resulting trends of risk appetite.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member evaluated that, while recovery in face-to-face service consumption had slowed somewhat, due to the tightening of disease control measures following the resurgence of the pandemic since the beginning of winter, the overall economic trend had not contracted greatly thanks to sustained growth in goods and non-face-to-face service consumption.",
        "The member saw that, despite the two-year-long COVID-19 shock, household income had increased considerably, thanks to growth in secondary income from government transfers, with the primary income of households recovering moderately.",
        "The member took the view that, given pent-up service demand since the outbreak of the pandemic and growth in surplus saving so far, there was an underlying trend of recovery in solid consumption demand.",
        "The member added that major export items and exports to major destinations all continued to increase sharply, thanks to solid growth in goods demand from abroad.",
        "The member noted that, while facilities investment had undergone an adjustment to some degree, affected by supply disruptions, construction investment had shown a trend of improvement.",
        "The member evaluated that employment conditions were continuing to improve, with the number of persons employed, the economic participation rate, the unemployment rate and the employment rate either nearly recovering to or exceeding the pre-pandemic levels.",
        "The member expected growth for this year not to deviate greatly from the November projection, as private consumption was likely to continue to recover thanks to the strengthening of the government’s support to cope with damages from the COVID-19 pandemic, and exports would also likely maintain strong growth, although uncertainties would remain high in line with the domestic COVID-19 situation for some time.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that consumer price inflation was running in the upper-3% range with inflationary pressures spreading, and annual inflation for this year could rise to the upper-2% range, considerably exceeding 2%, the level of both the inflation target and the previous forecast.",
        "The member also evaluated that there were significant potential upside risks depending upon impacts such as sustained global supply bottlenecks and rising inflation expectations going forward.",
        "The member noted that, since the middle of last year, rising import prices including commodity prices had been gradually leading to rising prices of final consumer goods through producer prices, and the number of items showing price increases in the Consumer Price Index had also been growing.",
        "The member emphasized that attention should be paid from the perspective of monetary policy to prevent the entrenchment of a feedback loop whereby the recent steep rises in prices of durable goods closely related to living such as cars and furniture as well as dining-out prices stimulate inflation expectations of the general public, and affect how firms set goods prices, service prices, or wages.",
        "The member judged the financial markets to still remain accommodative.",
        "The member noted that, although household lending growth had slowed due to the effects of regulations, corporate lending was sustaining a high rise based on eased lending attitudes of financial institutions, and a significant portion of the increase in corporate credit was seen to be flowing into the real estate market.",
        "The member saw that, although the uptrend in asset prices including housing prices was slowing, the potential demand for loans by economic agents still appeared to be high as the real interest rate had hardly risen despite last year’s two Base Rate hikes.",
        "The member added that market liquidity indicators including M2 were continuing to show high growth.",
        "The member judged that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic trends, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from 1.0% at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that it would be desirable to clearly convey the monetary policy authorities’ resolve to prevent instability in inflation expectations from expanding under the current circumstances.",
        "The member took the view that it would be necessary to clearly communicate with economic agents that adjustments to the accommodative stance of monetary policy would continue going forward to ensure that stability in the asset markets and the easing of the degree of worsening financial imbalances would become gradually entrenched.",
        "The member expected monetary policy normalization through an additional 25 basis point Base Rate hike at this meeting would not have large negative impacts on the economic recovery, taking into consideration the aforementioned ongoing recovery in solid demand at home and abroad.",
        "The member took the view that, although pandemic-related uncertainties were high, it was possible that economic activities would remain relatively insensitive to the spread of the Omicron variant, given that its impacts on economic recovery in major economies were more limited than initially feared.",
        "The member expressed the need to cautiously pursue monetary policy normalization to gradually steer the Base Rate close to the neutral interest rate level, while closely monitoring future real economic recovery and price movements, financial market conditions, spillover effects of Base Rate hikes, and the impacts on the domestic economy of changes in monetary policies in major economies.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current level of 1.00%.",
        "The member judged that, despite the resurgence of COVID-19, the domestic economy had continued to recover recently.",
        "The member mentioned that, although facilities investment had somewhat slowed, exports had sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand.",
        "The member evaluated that the improvement in private consumption had moderated somewhat, owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, but the moderation had not been as severe as during the previous resurgences, thanks to learning effects from the past and changes in consumption patterns.",
        "The member noted that labor market conditions had continued to improve, with the number of persons employed maintaining its substantial uptrend.",
        "Going forward, the member expected that the domestic economy would exhibit growth as forecast in the path projected in November last year, led by sustained strong exports and private consumption recovery.",
        "The member expressed the view that uncertainties over the virus had increased somewhat, affected by the spread of a new COVID-19 variant at home and abroad, but this would have only limited negative impacts on global trade and Korea’s exports and investment, since major countries were dealing with the surge by accelerating vaccinations and providing treatments, rather than constraining economic activity.",
        "Concerning consumption, the member mentioned that the recovery of face-to-face consumption had been delayed somewhat due to the recent strengthening of social-distancing measures.",
        "The member however judged that the underlying trend of recovery in private consumption would continue, as the effect of tighter measures would not last long, considering the recent acceleration of booster vaccinations and the downward trend of the number of confirmed cases, and the government was promoting additional income support measures.",
        "With regard to prices, the member assessed that consumer price inflation had risen to the upper-3% level and core inflation had run at the lower-2% level, as upward pressures on both the supply and demand sides had increased significantly.",
        "The member expected inflation to exceed the path projected in November for a considerable time, given the ongoing sharp rise in international commodity prices, the prolongation of global supply disruptions, and the growing upward pressures on the domestic demand side.",
        "The member expressed concerns that inflation expectations had also been increasing recently and, if such anxieties about price instability last for a long time, this would be highly likely to affect the degree of increase in wages and product prices, further expanding inflationary pressures.",
        "The member noted that housing price growth meanwhile had slowed somewhat in all parts of the country and that home-buyer sentiment and expectations of further increases in housing prices had also weakened.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member’s evaluation was that excessive yield-seeking behavior had been easing somewhat, with stock prices fluctuating within a narrow range and household debt continuing to exhibit slower growth.",
        "The member took the view that this seemed to be attributable to the continued rises in market rates as well as deposit and lending rates, following strengthening expectations of policy rate raises at home and abroad and the sustained government measure to control total debt volume.",
        "The member however judged that, since the continued substantial lending to the corporate sector and growth in monetary aggregates suggested that Korea’s financial conditions were very accommodative and leverage was continuing to increase, it seemed somewhat too early to shift attention from the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "The member took the view that, in overall consideration of growth, price and financial conditions of the Korean economy, it would be necessary to reduce the degree of accommodation.",
        "The member judged that the current Base Rate was substantially accommodative and further rate hikes would not undermine the economic and employment recovery.",
        "The member also pointed to the need to consider that the recent high inflation rate had been working to decrease real interest rates and further ease financial conditions.",
        "The member most of all emphasized that it was critical for now to raise the Base Rate preemptively to stabilize inflation expectations.",
        "The member expressed concerns that if inflation accelerates further and continues for a long period of time, more drastic policy adjustment would be required, resulting in greater loss in terms of growth.",
        "The member added that further rate hikes would contribute to enhancing the resilience of the Korean economy to external shocks by adjusting excessive leverage.",
        "The member expressed the view that financial market volatility was highly likely to increase significantly, in line with sudden changes in major country monetary policy stances due to inflation concerns, and that it would be therefore necessary to make preparations for this possibility.",
        "The member thus argued that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to view that the timing of further rate hikes should be determined while closely examining future developments related to COVID-19, growth and inflation trends, and the financial imbalance situation.",
        "The member added that vulnerable groups including small business owners suffering from hardship due to the pandemic should be continuously supported through selective policy measures such as the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from its current level of 1.00%.",
        "Looking at the international economy first, the member assessed that, although the trend of recovery in some regions such as Europe and China had slowed, affected by the spread of the Omicron virus, the underlying trend of recovery was continuing, led by the US and major emerging market economies.",
        "The member noted that, despite somewhat slower growth in trade in goods, affected by logistics disruptions, global trade was continuing to show a trend of steady improvement, particularly in trade in services, and a trend of recovery in the labor market was also ongoing.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that high inflationary pressures would persist longer than expected, due not only to supply disruptions, but also to rapid recovery in demand, and changes in the labor supply and demand structure.",
        "The member also saw that the possibility of an acceleration of monetary policy normalization in major countries to deal with these inflationary pressures had caused heightened volatility in the global financial market.",
        "The member forecast that, although the trend of recovery in face-to-face services had weakened somewhat, following the resurgence of the pandemic, the domestic economy would remain on the growth path projected at the previous MPB meeting, as exports and other private consumption would maintain solid growth.",
        "The member expected recovery in face-to-face services to materialize in full after the second quarter, as a large number of infectious disease specialists were forecasting that the emergency situation related to the coronavirus would be resolved in the first half of this year.",
        "However, the member expected consumer price inflation to be considerably higher than the previous projection, as it had risen to the upper-3% level of late, and remained high this year as well.",
        "The member saw that since the domestic economy was heavily dependent upon imports, cost push inflation would be unavoidable in the recent situation in which international oil prices and import prices were soaring.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that even when this factor was accounted for, the recent price situation was considerably worrisome.",
        "The member saw that the pace of increase in consumer prices had picked up of late due to a second round of spillover effects of rising food and international commodity prices, and interactions between prices and inflation expectations were partially materializing.",
        "The member noted that short-term inflation expectations of the general public had risen to 2.6% in December and raised the concern that unusually steep recent increases in personal service prices, including dining-out prices, were not irrelevant to inflation expectations.",
        "The member added that attention should be paid to the point that inflationary pressures were spreading to core items and widening further.",
        "The member saw that goods prices which had led low inflation since 2013 had rebounded last year, influenced by rising oil prices and supply disruptions, to record 4.5% growth in the fourth quarter, and would likely maintain high growth this year as well under the influence of a rise in the won-dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member expected service prices, which are more closely linked with underlying price movements and domestic economic activity, to pick up in line with recovery in domestic demand.",
        "The member pointed out that in a situation in which consumer price inflation, core inflation and inflation expectations were rising together, and goods and service prices were rising simultaneously, the pace and persistence of inflation could increase.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that increased vigilance was required with respect to future price developments.",
        "Meanwhile, concerning financial stability, the member assessed that, although risk appetites had partially reversed, as seen in an increase in bank deposits and a decrease in credit lending, and a higher self-financing ratio in housing purchases since the Base Rate hikes in the second half of last year, financial conditions still appeared to remain accommodative, with M2 growth reaching 12%.",
        "The member noted that this was because there was ongoing demand for household lending, mortgage lending in particular, and corporate lending was sustaining high growth, led by favorable conditions such as relatively low lending rates and policy financing support.",
        "The member assessed that, although volatility in price variables had heightened, due to concern about the spread of the pandemic and the impacts of domestic and international monetary policies, the financial market had remained stable in general, with the balance of foreign investment in bond markets, made by long-term investors in particular, hitting a record high and official foreign reserves sustaining a trend of growth.",
        "In overall consideration of the aforementioned economic and financial conditions, the member took the view that there would be no reason to delay the timing of normalization of the unprecedentedly accommodative monetary policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, although there was a concern that an additional Base Rate hike could weaken the momentum of the economic recovery, negative effects of a Base Rate hike were unlikely to be large as the economy was maintaining an underlying recovery trend.",
        "The member added that, given the growing trade-off between economic activity and inflation, and that there were ongoing financial imbalances, a Base Rate hike would do more good than harm to macroeconomic stability over the medium-term horizon.",
        "However, the member saw that speedy Base Rate normalization could increase risks of vulnerable households and firms in the current conditions of increased leverage throughout the entire economy in the course of responding to the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "The member thus expressed the need to monitor the relevant risks, maintain support for sectors adversely affected by the pandemic, and pursue improvements in the debt structure to prepare for a policy tightening stance in the medium to long term.",
        "Another member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.00% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that economic shocks from COVID-19 had lasted for the third consecutive year, due to the spread of the Omicron variant.",
        "The member noted that the US and Korea were two major countries that had been showing a favorable recovery despite the resurgence of the pandemic.",
        "The member forecast that the US would raise its policy rate earlier than expected, as inflation had been accelerating and inflation expectations had been spreading along with the economic recovery.",
        "As for Korea, the member expected that consumer price inflation, having risen by 3.7% year on year in December last year, was highly likely to remain high in the 3% range in the first quarter this year and at the mid- to upper-2% level for the year overall.",
        "The member added that the trend of above-target inflation would continue for a considerable period of time.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need to recognize that it takes quite a long time for an economy to recover in the event of an unusually large economic shock.",
        "The member argued that, in this regard, in determining whether economic indicators have recovered or not, they should be examined not on a quarterly or annual basis but over a longer-term horizon.",
        "The member added that it was necessary to break away from the practice of measuring and responding to year-on-year inflation on a monthly basis.",
        "The member mentioned that, in the current pandemic crisis, it would be appropriate to look at changes in economic indicators compared to those during the same period of 2019, before the pandemic.",
        "The member went on to state that consumer price inflation in the US had risen by 8.5% in December last year compared to the figure recorded in the same period of two years ago, while increasing 4.3% in Korea over the same period, and that core inflation had risen by 7.2% in the US and by 2.9% in Korea over the last two years.",
        "The member presented the view that, even when viewed from a monetary policy strategy perspective that accepts above-target inflation for a considerable period of time in an unusual situation, US inflation was currently deviating far from its long-term average target and thus policy responses seemed urgently needed.",
        "As for Korea, however, the member’s evaluation was that there were only slight inflationary pressures at the moment.",
        "The member stressed the need to pay close attention to the level of inflation compared to that of the pre-pandemic period in monitoring the inflation trend.",
        "Looking at the trend of the economic recovery, meanwhile, the member projected that, with the spread of the Omicron variant, the economy was likely to grow more slowly than expected in the first half of this year, and slowing Chinese growth and a shift in the US policy would put downward pressures on the Korean economy.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, although the Korean economy had been getting through the crisis relatively well, there was a high likelihood that, without accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, the domestic economy would return to its growth trend of the pre-pandemic period next year at the earliest.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, considering the economic situation and the spread of COVID-19, the domestic economy still needed a make-up strategy, and an environment had not yet been created in which the Base Rate could be raised back to the level immediately before the outbreak of COVID-19.",
        "The member added that, since the Base Rate had been raised on two occasions in August and November last year, it would be necessary to examine the effects of these rate hikes.",
        "The member in this regard judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level.",
        "The member also took the view that, while closely monitoring future economic recovery, inflation and financial market conditions, it would be necessary to keep adjusting the degree of the monetary easing stance so that the Base Rate could near the neutral interest rate.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Joo, Sangyong expressed clear opposition to the idea of raising the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points and argued for keeping it at its current level.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision - The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.00% to 1.25%.",
        "- Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of a new coronavirus variant, as economic activity has not contracted significantly, supported by accelerated vaccinations.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have rebounded after having declined, affected by developments related to COVID-19 and changes in expectations about monetary policy in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "- The Korean economy has continued to recover despite the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "Although the improvement in private consumption has moderated owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, exports have sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand.",
        "Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained trend of increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery of private consumption is forecast to pick up again while exports are expected to continue their solid trend of increase.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3%, consistent with the forecast in November.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-3% level due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products, as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of non-petroleum industrial products and personal services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at the lower-2% level and the inflation expectations of the general public have run at the mid- to upper-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to run in the 3% range for a considerable time, exceeding the path projected in November, and above the mid-2% level for the year overall.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to run considerably above 2% this year.",
        "- In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates fell due to concerns over the resurgence of COVID-19 but have rebounded affected by the rise in US Treasury yields.",
        "The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose considerably, due mainly to the prospect of accelerating monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, but then decreased.",
        "Stock prices have fallen slightly.",
        "The amount of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has somewhat moderated in all parts of the country.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (February 2022),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, the domestic economy continued to recover overall, led by the underlying trend of improvement in private consumption, especially in goods consumption, and by the solid trend of increase in exports.",
        "Some members stressed that it would be necessary to remain on the alert against the possibility of uncertainties such as geopolitical risks and prolonged global supply constraints having a negative impact on the future domestic economic recovery.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased, with inflationary pressure expanding into a wide range of core items.",
        "Some members expressed the view that attention should be paid to the potential effects of the Ukraine crisis on inflation in Korea through channels of international commodity prices and inflation expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, members assessed that volatility in price variables of some financial assets had heightened, owing chiefly to monetary policy changes at home and abroad and geopolitical risks.",
        "Some members mentioned that, despite slowed growth in household lending due to rate hikes and stronger regulations, corporate lending had been showing strong growth, and it would be therefore necessary to pay attention to financial imbalances stemming from increased leverage in the private sector.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to export conditions from a medium- and long-term perspective and the effect of overseas portfolio investment by Korean residents on capital flows.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic situations, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25% The member evaluated that, despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, the trend of the global economy and trade continued to recover, but global inflation pressures had heightened even further with a recovery in supply disruptions delayed longer than expected and global oil prices increasing at a faster pace.",
        "In particular, the member forecast that the recently escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have a substantial impact on the global economy by way of a delayed recovery of global supply chains and contraction of international trade, as well as rises in energy, commodity and grain prices.",
        "The member expected that the domestic economy would remain on the growth path projected in November, since economic activity was getting back to normal and goods exports continued their solid trend of increase, although COVID-19 was spreading rapidly in Korea unlike in the rest of the world.",
        "The member however noted that careful analysis and assessment of the future growth path were needed, since there existed downside risks to exports, such as the escalating geopolitical risks and a delayed recovery of global supply chains, and there was a lack of improvement in structural factors behind low growth, including population aging, the surge in household debt, the slowdown in fixed capital stock growth, and the sluggishness of services sectors with low added values.",
        "In terms of consumption, the member expressed concerns that, although consumption capacity was expected to increase on the back of increased forced savings since the pandemic, increased burdens of household debt repayment and housing expenses could act as factors limiting consumption.",
        "The member added that, as foreign direct investment had recently increased in quantitative terms on the back of strengthening trade and environmental regulations, and in qualitative terms as well with growth seen in overseas investment for local production rather than processing and intermediate trade, there was a possibility of an increased negative substitution effect on exports and domestic investment.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member’s assessment was, although that the Research Department had raised its inflation forecast for this year significantly to 3.1% and also adjusted its core inflation forecast upward to 2.6%, upside risks were even greater considering the recent global oil price trend and inflation pressures.",
        "The member also stated that, with the recent inflation pressures attributable largely to supply-side factors, producer prices were rising faster than consumer prices.",
        "The member went on to stress that, since the Korean economy is dependent highly on exports and investment, it would be necessary to pay close attention to the channel through which producer prices directly limit growth by way of cost increases.",
        "Looking at financial stability, the member assessed the exchange rate and capital flows as showing limited volatility thanks to improved external soundness, although stock market volatility had expanded due to a likely early tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
        "The member mentioned that, although household debt growth had slowed, household debt was estimated to be exhibiting faster year-on-year growth than nominal GDP, and corporate lending sustained strong growth, resulting in a continued increase in the private sector leverage.",
        "In summary, the member’s evaluation was that, compared with the previous meeting, downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, but the economy had maintained its recovery since last year.",
        "The member also assessed that upside risks to inflation had grown even further and financial imbalances still required attention.",
        "In this regard, the member assessed that it would be appropriate to operate the Base Rate so as to reduce the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member however argued that, since uncertainties surrounding economic conditions at home and abroad had increased recently owing to the spread of the pandemic, geopolitical risks and early normalization of major country monetary policies, and since there was a need to examine the effect of three Base Rate hikes last year, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and monitor future changes in the domestic and international economic situations.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%.",
        "The member mentioned that the global economy seemed to have maintained its recovery overall, with the US and Europe easing COVID-19 restrictions after having gone through the peak of the spread of the Omicron variant.",
        "The member assessed that, although global supply disruptions had improved somewhat, global oil prices had risen and the international financial markets had become more volatile owing to the escalating geopolitical risks involving Russia and Ukraine.",
        "The member noted that, although short-term downside risks had expanded somewhat in line with a surge in the spread of the Omicron variant since February, the domestic economy seemed to maintain its recovery overall and was expected to grow by around the previous projection of 3.0% this year.",
        "The member mentioned that private consumption had slowed, due to temporary factors such as the shutdown of automakers for a transition to new production lines, but maintained its underlying trend of recovery based on improved income conditions for households.",
        "The member went on to note that exports also continued to grow, led by those of semiconductor and petroleum products.",
        "The member also stated that improvement in construction investment had been limited owing to stronger safety management of construction sites and facilities investment had been adjusted slightly centering around machinery and automobiles.",
        "The member assessed employment as continuing to improve, with the number of persons employed rising significantly and the unemployment rate declining.",
        "The member took the view that, when the spread of the virus peaks and the pandemic gradually turns into an endemic, consumption related to face-to-face activities, which had been suppressed so far, would become brisk and exports and investment would sustain growth based on demand for the digital transition and the fight against climate change.",
        "The member noted that concerns about a possible prolongation of inflation had recently heightened even further and that keeping inflation under control had emerged as a key issue for monetary policy in major advanced countries.",
        "As for the Korean economy, the member mentioned that the rate of increase in import prices had remained high in the 20-30% range for a considerable period of time since the second half of last year.",
        "The member projected that consumer price inflation would remain in the mid to upper-3% range for the time being, since a rise in imported raw material prices had affected consumer prices in Korea with a time lag, causing dining-out costs and prices of processed food products to increase at even faster paces, and would likely continue to exert upward pressures on consumer prices in Korea going forward.",
        "The member presented the view that, although the wage growth rate and inflation expectations had been changing gradually and upward pressures on inflation would likely weaken somewhat in the second half of this year, consumer price inflation for this year would exceed 3%, considering the recent increasing tendency of corporations to pass on cost increases to consumers, and a possible increase in personal service charges, such as private education costs and leisure facility fees.",
        "Regarding financial markets, the member assessed that financial market volatility had increased since the previous meeting, with the Treasury bond yield rising and stock prices substantially falling on the back of expectations of an acceleration of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and concerns about a supplementary budget.",
        "The member pointed out that, although household lending growth had slowed, affected by strengthening regulations and rising interest rates, and housing prices had been stabilizing recently, corporate lending maintained strong growth, influenced by the control on household lending, and the M2 growth rate remained high.",
        "The member stressed that regulations on credit extension had been eased temporarily in response to the COVID-19 shock in a situation where marginal firms accounted for a substantial portion of Korea’ corporate sector.",
        "Since this measure would inevitably have to be normalized gradually and interest rates were rising at home and abroad, it would be necessary to carefully analyze and assess effects of credit to the corporate sector, which had exhibited a sharp increase, on financial system stability and corporate financial soundness.",
        "The member judged that the three rate hikes since August last year had been easing the household debt risk and excessive yield-seeking behavior at a pace that had provided accommodative financial conditions to support the economic recovery while at the same time ensuring that the economic recovery was not undermined significantly.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that it would be necessary to take more time to observe the trends and impacts of the ongoing massive spread of the Omicron variant and the Ukraine crisis, and that another rate hike at this time following the previous two consecutive rate hikes could make financial markets more volatile in the short term in a situation where market anxiety had heightened due to expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and external risk factors.",
        "The member, however, noted that increased inflation expectations and continued strong liquidity growth suggested that the current monetary policy stance remained substantially accommodative, and that if the current trend of an economic upturn continues, an additional adjustment of the degree of monetary easing would be needed.",
        "The member mentioned that, unless the adjustment is made at the right time and at the right pace, a larger degree of adjustment would be inevitable later on, which could have a huge impact on the economy and financial markets.",
        "The member presented the view that it would be necessary to raise the Base Rate further at an appropriate time while closely monitoring the trends of prices and inflation expectations as well as the domestic economy, changes in major country monetary policies and financial market developments at home and abroad.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had continued to recover as in the previous year, but the pace of recovery had been slowing recently affected largely by the spread of Omicron, and inflation had continued to grow in major countries owing to the further uptrend in energy prices and prolonged disruptions in global supply chains.",
        "The member noted that, in reflection of this, the IMF had adjusted the global economic growth rate downward by 50 basis points in its recent adjusted outlook (in January).",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member evaluated that consumption had improved at a slower pace, due to the spread of COVID-19 and the prolonged measures to combat the pandemic, and the recent surge in the number of confirmed Omicron cases had further heightened uncertainty of consumption.",
        "The member noted that the underlying trend of improvement in consumption had continued driven by consumption of goods, but consumption of services still depended upon developments of the pandemic.",
        "Concerning investment, the member mentioned that facilities investment, having grown significantly over the last two years, was going through a correction, while a rise in material prices had led to a delay in the recovery of construction investment.",
        "The member added that, as imports surged even though exports of most items had continued their uptrend led by strong global goods demand, the trade account had registered a deficit and the Ukraine crisis had added to uncertainties.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had remained at the 3% level since October last year.",
        "The member noted that, driven by the recovery in domestic demand, combined with supply-side factors including a surge in energy prices and supply chain disruptions, upward pressures on inflation had increased more than originally expected, and core inflation also stood at the mid-2% level, with inflationary pressure expanding into core items such as personal services and durables.",
        "The member added that the recent surge in inflation was taking place throughout the world and the IMF had made a huge upward adjustment to its global inflation forecast for this year The member assessed that major countries had been attempting to change their monetary policy stances in response to rising inflation.",
        "The member noted that the Bank of England had raised its policy rate in February this year as in December last year, and expected the US Federal Reserve to start rate hikes from March onwards.",
        "The member however evaluated that, although inflation had exceeded the target in most countries, measures to cope with this varied from country to country.",
        "The member mentioned that the ECB had been taking a careful approach focusing more on the economy than on inflation, while countries like Sweden had expressed their determination to maintain their monetary easing stances out of concerns about unpredictable effects of a monetary policy shift on production and employment.",
        "The member added that Korea, with its three Base Rate hikes since August last year, is one of the major countries which started normalizing monetary policy preemptively.",
        "The member stressed that the most distinct aspect of Korea’s policy shift was the strengthening of regulations on household lending along with Base Rate hikes, and noted that interest rates on household lending had risen rapidly due to the heightened lending regulations, while real interest rates excluding inflation expectations had already exceeded their pre-COVID-19 levels.",
        "The member presented the view that monetary policy needed an entirely different approach in a new environment with stronger lending regulations, and emphasized that it was time to focus more on the non-discriminating effects of the Base Rate on the real economy than on measures to promote financial stability.",
        "The member argued that the Korean economy had been overcoming the crisis relatively successfully based on strong goods exports, but it was now faced with a new challenge — increases in interest rates and inflation had caused the production costs of businesses to rise and household purchasing power to weaken compared with the pre-COVID-19 period.",
        "The member judged that inflationary pressures were high but not to such a critical degree as to require measures to suppress them, which would contract economic activity.",
        "The member noted that inflationary pressures would continue until the first half of this year at the earliest, but things could change drastically if supply-side problems are resolved to some extent.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the COVID-19 pandemic was an asymmetrical shock that had hit the services sector and consumption harder than the manufacturing sector and exports.",
        "The member mentioned that if it were concluded that the crisis is over based only on aggregate indicators such as GDP growth, or if rate hikes were accelerated on the basis of cost-push inflation, the economic recovery would lose momentum.",
        "The member noted that real private consumption had declined by 1.6% over two years since 2019 and employment of the prime-age labor force (those aged between view that it would be necessary to observe the effects of the previous three Base Rate hikes since August last year.",
        "The member stressed the need to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the time being while closely examining developments of virus variants, the trend of recovery in overall domestic demand and sectors hit hard by the pandemic, and movements of core inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation and core inflation had risen by 4.6% and 3.3%, respectively, over the two years since January 2020, immediately before the outbreak of COVID-19, and emphasized the importance of achieving the inflation target over a medium-term horizon.",
        "In particular, the member argued that, since the current inflationary pressures had been caused by an exceptional situation of a pandemic, even if inflation exceeds its target but is not extemely excessive, it would be appropriate cautiously respond to a departure of inflation from its target while monitoring the path of convergence toward its target.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member judged that the Korean economy was maintaining a trend of recovery, despite the worsening of the spread of the Omicron variant.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, while facilities investment was undergoing an adjustment, exports were maintaining high growth, bolstered by solid global demand, and private consumption was maintaining an underlying trend of recovery, thanks to a favorable increase in consumption of goods, despite a slight slowdown in face-to-face service consumption stemming from the worsening of the spread of the pandemic.",
        "Concerning labor market conditions, the member noted that the number of persons employed was maintaining its substantial uptrend, and household income conditions were improving thanks to a solid upward trend in wages.",
        "The member expected the Korean economy to grow at around 3%, consistent with the 2021 November forecast, thanks to buoyant exports and sustained recovery in private consumption.",
        "The member forecast that exports and investment were likely to remain strong in line with improved global trade, particularly since major countries would resume economic activity thanks to the easing of their social distancing measures.",
        "The member expected consumption to be affected by the spread of the Omicron variant for some time, and then to return to rapid recovery, as this virus spread cycle would stabilize after reaching its peak.",
        "However, the member judged uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be heightened further, since major countries were changing their monetary policy stances rapidly to respond to higher inflation since the second half of last year, and geopolitical risks surrounding Ukraine were also increasing.",
        "The member noted that a stronger-than-expected upward trend in prices was continuing.",
        "Looking at recent price conditions, the member saw that, as factors pointed to as upside risks such as an ongoing upward trend in commodity prices and prolonged global supply bottlenecks were materializing, strong upward trends in prices were witnessed across core items.",
        "The member argued that, although the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised upward the inflation forecast for this year to the 3% range in reflection of this, upside risks to the price path still remained high.",
        "The member stated that inflationary pressures could accumulate, as accommodative financial conditions were continuing, despite economic recovery particularly in major advanced economies.",
        "The member saw that the recent Ukraine crisis was not only accelerating the upward trend in prices through a rise in international commodity prices, but also making inflation expectations unstable.",
        "The member emphasized that it would be necessary to guard against the possibility of second-round effects of the consequent interaction between price indexes and inflation expectations.",
        "The member evaluated that investor sentiment was partially contracting, as volatility in the financial market had increased, with interest rates rising steeply and stock prices falling.",
        "However, the member judged financial conditions to remain accommodative, since M2 growth had not shown any sign of decline since the beginning of this year after rising to the 13% level, and corporations were raising funds on a large scale through stocks and corporate bonds.",
        "On the financial stability side, the member pointed out the need to pay attention to the rapid increase in credit supply to the corporate sector, although increase in housing prices had slowed significantly of late, and household debt growth was moderating.",
        "The member added that attention should be paid to the possibility that there had been a significant buildup of funds provision which failed to properly reflect credit risk in the course of providing financial support to vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member took the view that, in overall consideration of growth, price and financial conditions of the Korean economy, it would be necessary to further reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "The member added that it was important that preemptive measures be taken, particularly given that upside risks surrounding the future price path were heavily dependent upon inflation expectations, and that Base Rate hikes affected the economy with a time lag.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to anchor expectations of economic agents by communicating with the market about resolute policy intention.",
        "From the perspective of financial stability, the member stated that it would be necessary to prepare against possible volatility shocks in the international financial market by inducing economic agents to adjust excessively heightened leverage and making the financial market more resilient.",
        "However, the member also took the view that, in consideration of the need to assess the effects of the past three Base Rate hikes and to keep a close watch on the developments of factors causing recently heightened uncertainties, such as a move toward acceleration of monetary policy normalization in major economies and heightened geopolitical risks stemming from the Ukraine crisis, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25%.",
        "One member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that, although the global economy was continuing its sound recovery trend, as seen in growth in global trade and real economic indicators of major economies, the future growth path could be seriously affected by the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation and changes in monetary policy in major economies, and the development of geopolitical risks related to Ukraine.",
        "The member assessed that, on the domestic economic front, although facilities investment and construction investment were sluggish due to one-off factors, private consumption was maintaining an underlying trend of recovery and employment was continuing to improve.",
        "The member also noted that market income excluding the secondary income from government transfers had risen in all income groups of late, and the trend of improvement was expanding even in the low-income group hit the hardest at the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "With respect to the financial and foreign exchange sectors, the member assessed that economic agents’ search-for-yield across asset markets had abated, and macroprudential indicators appeared favorable in the internal and external sectors.",
        "The member stated that growth in household lending and housing prices, two major factors causing financial imbalances, had slowed, due to the impacts of several factors such as strengthened loan management and higher lending rates.",
        "The member took the view that special policy attention should be paid to inflation.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation was not higher than in most major economies for the moment and consumer price inflation and inflation expectations were still low even compared to past periods of heightened price inflation.",
        "However, the member stated that consumer price inflation was remaining at the mid- to upper-3% range, and core inflation also had risen to the mid-2% range.",
        "The member stated that taking into account the possibility of the effects of energy price shocks and trends of increase in global grain prices stemming from the Ukraine crisis spreading with a time lag, concern about inflation would not be small.",
        "However, the member suggested a few reasons for preferring keeping the Base Rate unchanged, despite such concern.",
        "First, it was still unclear how large the uncertainties surrounding and shocks stemming from the Ukraine crisis would be and how long they would continue for the moment.",
        "Although Korea does not have large trade volumes with Russia and Ukraine, negative supply shocks might be seen through higher commodity prices, and negative demand shocks via an indirect route through for instance the EU.",
        "The member noted that the negative supply shocks clearly would increase inflation.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that in a situation in which it was difficult to reasonably predict the size and persistence of such shocks, a Base Rate hike could negatively affect the recovery and growth path of the domestic economy going forward through the demand side.",
        "Second, it would be necessary to keep a close watch on monetary policy trends in major economies and their impacts on the market.",
        "Some overseas central banks had already begun monetary tightening and the US Federal Reserve and the ECB were expected to join this trend soon, and this would mean a decline in the massive liquidity injected in the economy due to COVID-19.",
        "In this situation, investment portfolios and fund flows could change greatly.",
        "The member assessed that the international financial market was already seeing a risk-off pattern and the market was highly likely to be more volatile.",
        "The member took the view that, in consideration of risks related to the newly added Ukraine crisis as well, a better option at this juncture would be to decide to take response measures after observing the effects of the existing preemptive monetary policy measures and the development of external uncertainties, rather than to take policy countermeasures based on uncertain information.",
        "The member emphasized that, while the most important variables in the future would be those related to inflation, it would be necessary to carefully monitor uncertainties in the asset markets caused by changes in monetary policy in major economies, and the evolution of global risks stemming from the Ukraine crisis, as external factors.",
        "The member noted that, to this end, it would be necessary to strengthen market monitoring and communications with market participants, and actively consider market stabilization measures in times of rapidly heightened market volatility.",
        "Concerning financial imbalances, the member expressed the opinion that there was a need for close monitoring of the possibility of a recovery of profit-seeking demand in the housing market, and of whether unproductive demand for funds was increasing in the commercial real estate market.",
        "Another member presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at its current level of 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "Looking at changes in the domestic and overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member judged that the global economy was continuing its recovery trend, despite the spread of the pandemic, and inflationary pressures were continuing to increase.",
        "The member noted that, while growth was moderating somewhat of late, due to worsened health care conditions, given the nature of the Omicron variant identified by major advanced economies, the economic impacts during this spread of COVID-19 were highly likely to moderate or last for a shorter period of time than previous waves.",
        "The member noted that, in the domestic economy, growth in service consumption in particular was slowing, due to stronger social distancing measures and weakened consumer sentiment since December last year.",
        "However, the member assessed that the GDP gap would likely shift into positive territory in the first half of this year as originally forecast, as exports remained strong and goods consumption and employment conditions were sustaining relatively favorable improvement, with the correlation between the spread of COVID-19 and economic activity having become much lower.",
        "However, the member stated that economic uncertainties had heightened as the spread of the pandemic in Korea was deepening and persisting longer than in major advanced economies.",
        "The member also cautioned that global supply bottlenecks could be resolved later than expected, due to the restrengthening of social distancing measures in some emerging economies including China, and the intensification of geopolitical conflicts, changes in monetary policies of major economies, and heightened financial market volatility could negatively affect economic trends at home and abroad.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that consumer price inflation continued to run at the widened further.",
        "The member assessed that since, above all, inflationary pressures were increasing rapidly for items with strong downward rigidity such as durable goods and personal services, inflation would remain well above the target for a long time, and its interactions with inflation expectations and wage increases were highly likely to materialize.",
        "The member estimated that, although the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised the price outlook upward, there still were huge upside risks to the price path, in consideration of global energy price movements, prolongation of supply disruptions and geopolitical risks, and trend of demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Finally, the member evaluated that, in the financial market, market volatility had been increasing, due to strengthened risk aversion stemming for instance from changes in expectations for monetary policy normalization by major economies and intensified geopolitical conflicts.",
        "The member saw that, against this backdrop, the risks of a buildup in financial imbalances were easing somewhat, with the rate of household lending growth falling for the second consecutive month and prices of assets such as stocks and real estate undergoing corrections, due to policy effects such as strengthened loan regulations and the Base Rate hikes.",
        "However, the member noted that since the household debt-to-income ratio and housing price-to-income ratio were remaining at much higher levels than those of major economies and compared to their long-term trends, they remained as potential vulnerabilities in the financial system over the medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "The member saw that corporate-sector leverage was continuing a substantial uptrend, backed by abundant market liquidity, and regulation-avoiding balloon effects such as a sharp increase in real estate investment through corporate lending were being observed.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to continue policy efforts to ease the risks of an accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "The member judged that, overall, the Korean economy was maintaining an underlying trend of recovery, and upward pressures on inflation expectations were continuing to increase, as the GDP gap was expected to shift into positive territory in the first half of this year, and inflation had been exceeding the target for a long time.",
        "The member thus stated that it would be desirable to continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon.",
        "However, the member pointed out that financial imbalances were showing signs of slight improvement thanks to the three preemptive Base Rate hikes since August last year, while uncertainties surrounding the growth path had heightened due to recent pandemic conditions, geopolitical risks, and monetary policy normalization by major economies.",
        "The member thus took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level and closely monitor domestic and international financial and economic conditions and the ripple effects of the policy rate hikes.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of coronavirus variants, as economic activity has not contracted significantly, supported by accelerated vaccinations.",
        "Volatility in global financial markets has increased, affected by concerns over the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate hikes as well as the Ukraine crisis.",
        "Government bond yields in major countries have risen sharply and stock prices have fallen considerably.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks.",
        "- The Korean economy has continued to recover despite the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "Although the improvement in private consumption has moderated owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, exports have sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand.",
        "Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained trend of increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery of private consumption is forecast to gradually pick up again while exports are expected to continue their solid trend of increase.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3%, not deviating greatly from the November forecast.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-3% range due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of personal services and industrial products.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-2% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have run at the mid- to upper-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run substantially above 3% for a considerable time, exceeding the path projected in November, and run at the lower-3% level for the year overall.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to rise to the mid-2% level this year.",
        "- In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and stock prices have fallen considerably while the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has increased slightly, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "The amount of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has moderated in all parts of the country.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, the effects of the Base Rate raises, monetary policy changes in major countries, and the trends of growth and inflation.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (April 2022),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, despite sluggishness in facilities and construction investment, the domestic economy was continuing its sound recovery, led by a modest improvement in private consumption following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, as well as by buoyant exports in line with robust global demand.",
        "In addition, members stated that labor market conditions had continued to improve, with the number of persons employed surging and the unemployment rate falling.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased greatly, with inflationary pressure expanding into a wide range of items, and the Ukraine crisis working as additional upward pressure, expecting inflation to remain above the target for a considerable period of time going forward.",
        "Some members expressed the need to take preemptive measures to ensure stable management of inflation expectations, while keeping a close watch on the possibility of persistent inflation affected by cumulative supply-side and demand-side inflationary factors, and on second-round effects leading to wage increases.",
        "In addition, some members expressed the view that there would be a need to monitor the impacts on prices of structural factors, such as the restructuring of global value chains, as well as cyclical factors.",
        "Meanwhile, members assessed that volatility in price indices of financial assets had heightened, owing chiefly to heightened uncertainties stemming from monetary policy changes at home and abroad and the prolongation of geopolitical risks.",
        "Some members mentioned that, despite slowed growth in household lending, financial conditions still remained accommodative, with credit to the corporate sector exhibiting a sharp increase and financial institutions easing their lending attitudes, and, taking these points into account, it would be necessary to pay attention to the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to soundness changes in the external sector, such as capital flows associated with heightened volatility in the foreign exchange and international financial markets in the future.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic situations, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from 1.25% to 1.50%.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from its current level of 1.25% to 1.50%.",
        "The member judged that the domestic economy had been continuing its steady growth of late, despite heightened external uncertainties caused by the Ukraine crisis.",
        "The member noted that, although facilities investment was undergoing a correction, exports were sustaining strong growth, thanks to the robust global demand for goods.",
        "The member stated that private consumption was returning to the path of recovery, supported by the relaxing of disease control measures, after slowing under the effects of a more severe spread of COVID-19 in the country.",
        "On the employment front, the member added that there had been clear improvements in employment conditions, thanks to a sustained trend of significant increase in the number of persons employed and a sharp fall in the unemployment rate.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to show growth falling somewhat short of the path forecast in February, but saw that growth in the upper 2% range still exceeding the potential level would be possible going forward, led by strong exports and private consumption recovery.",
        "The member noted that the Ukraine crisis and China’s zero-COVID policy might work to constrain global economic recovery mainly on the supply side, but exports and investment would maintain favorable growth, since global demand for goods was expected to remain solid.",
        "The member expected consumption to rapidly return to recovery, as the spread of COVID-19 in the country had passed the peak and was gradually stabilizing, and income conditions were improving on the back of favorable labor conditions.",
        "However, the member expressed the need to carefully monitor factors acting to increase uncertainties concerning the future growth path at home, including acceleration of monetary policy normalization in major economies, the prolonged Ukraine crisis, and a possible economic growth slowdown in China.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member noted that with upward pressures increasing, consumer price inflation had exceeded 4% of late, and core inflation had risen to a level close to 3%.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to far exceed the path projected in February, as impacts of rises in commodity prices and global supply disruptions, the two factors working to increase prices since the second half of last year, had grown since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis.",
        "The member noted that, accordingly, inflation expectations of the general public had been nearing 3% of late, and raised concern about the possibility of second-round effects of the consequent interaction between prices and inflation expectations materializing in full.",
        "The member stated that domestic prices were heavily influenced by the external sector, and argued that at the base of the recent global high inflation there were not only supply-side factors but also demand pressures exceeding the potential level stemming from the expansionary policy operations.",
        "The member added that unless these upward inflationary pressures disappeared, global inflation could remain high for a long time.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member evaluated that volatility had increased considerably, as market interest rates were rising significantly on changes in expectations for monetary policy at home and abroad and stock prices had been sensitive to changes in the international political landscape.",
        "The member noted in particular that the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had risen significantly, driven by the strong dollar trend, influenced by preference for safe haven assets stemming from escalating geopolitical risks, as well as by expectations of an acceleration of monetary policy normalization by the Federal Reseve.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, while the risk of financial imbalances related to domestic household debt was easing gradually, banks had been gradually relaxing their lending attitudes of late.",
        "The member thus added that it would be necessary to observe a little longer to see whether these trends would continue.",
        "The member judged overall financial conditions to still remain accommodative, as the M2 growth rate was remaining high exceeding 10% due to the continued supply of credit to the corporate sector in particular, although it had declined slightly due to a base effect.",
        "The member pointed out the possibility that there could have been a significant buildup of funds provision which failed to properly reflect credit risk in the course of providing financial support to corporations and small business owners, and presented the opinion that special attention should be paid to the point that this could work as another destabilizing factor on the financial stability side going forward.",
        "The member judged that, in overall consideration of domestic economic growth, inflation and financial conditions, it would be necessary to steadily reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite heightened external uncertainties, the economy was expected to maintain a growth trend above the potential level for some time, while upward inflationary pressures had increased further of late and there would be an increasing possibility of much clearer second-round effects through inflation expectations.",
        "The member noted that the recently heightened upward pressures on wages and the gradual spread of the uptrend in prices from commodities to final goods and service charges were suggesting that such concerns were materializing to some extent.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to keep in mind that the recent rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was acting as an additional upward pressure on domestic prices through import prices.",
        "The member saw that, against this backdrop, it would be very important to stabilize inflation expectations by maintaining the current preemptive monetary policy stance in a consistent manner and communicating clear policy intentions to economic agents, and this policy response would serve as a foundation for macroeconomic stability in the medium to long term.",
        "On the financial stability side, the member stressed the need to prepare against possible volatility shocks in the international financial market that might occur during the course of steep monetary policy normalization in major economies, by inducing economic agents to adjust excessively heightened leverage in an orderly manner and making the financial market more resilient.",
        "The member thus presented the view that it would be better to raise the Base Rate from its current level of 1.25% to 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that the Board should judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to uncertainties such as monetary policy normalization in major economies and the impacts from the Ukraine crisis.",
        "The member went on to express the opinion that, absent any major changes in such circumstances, the Board should preemptively reduce the degree of accommodation in a consistent manner, while putting the top priority on ensuring stability in inflation expectations.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25%.",
        "The member evaluated that uncertainties had grown again, due to the combination of shocks such as the recent Ukraine-Russia War, economic slowdown in China, and monetary policy normalization in major economies, although the world economy was gradually emerging from a health crisis that had persisted for the past two years.",
        "The member saw that such shocks would likely have only limited impacts on growth during the course of world economic recovery, but expected the extent and duration of global inflation to increase further, due to rising international commodity prices and worsening global supply chain disruptions.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite somewhat sluggish facilities and construction investment affected by supply disruptions, the domestic economy was making a soft landing, thanks to the ongoing decoupling between private consumption and the pandemic situation, and to a sustained solid recovery in exports.",
        "The member expected the positive GDP gap to widen gradually after the second quarter, as the economy would continue to show growth exceeding its potential level.",
        "However, the member saw that consumer price inflation and core inflation were running at 4.1% and 2.9%, respectively, in March, well above the target of 2%, and saw these patterns as unlikely to reverse to a trend of price stabilization in a short period of time.",
        "The member noted that the surge in inflation was highly likely to act as a downside risk to growth through a decline in real purchasing power, an increase in production costs, and heightened economic uncertainties.",
        "The member evaluated that, when comparing the recent period of inflation with periods of supply shocks, such as the commodity supercycle in the mid-2000s and the period of political unrest in the Middle East in the early 2010s, the increase in commodity prices was larger and compounded by demand-side upward inflationary pressures.",
        "The member stated that, contrary to the past periods, core inflation had risen sharply and the diffusion index for consumer prices remained high, clearly showing second-round effects.",
        "The member added that accordingly there was a lot of concern that high inflation could persist.",
        "The member noted that, most importantly, prices and wages were showing a clearer correlation due to the rapid pace of rise in nominal wages since last year and keen attention was being paid in this regard.",
        "Meanwhile, the member evaluated that the slowing of household debt and housing price growth since the beginning of this year was largely attributable to tighter regulations, and that the continued high growth in market liquidity and the sustained accumulation of stand-by funds by financial institutions were factors making the Board stay vigilant from the perspective of financial imbalances.",
        "Given economic, inflation and financial conditions of late, the member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that inflationary pressures of late were greatly attributable to supply shocks.",
        "However, the member pointed out that, contrary to the past, there was a large trade-off between growth and inflation due mainly to recovery in demand at home and abroad.",
        "The member thus evaluated that the benefits of suppressed inflation from a Base Rate hike would outweigh the cost of slower growth.",
        "The member raised concern about increased burdens of household debt repayment resulting from a Base Rate hike, but expected the improvement in household income so far and the lengthening of loan maturities to work to ease the actual repayment burdens.",
        "Given that the rapid decline in real interest rates of late had made them deviate more widely from the neutral interest rate, the member presented the view that the Board should move toward reducing the accommodative stance in its conduct of monetary policy going forward.",
        "However, the member expressed the need to determine the time and pace of an additional Base Rate hike depending on developments in economic and financial conditions.",
        "The member added that uncertainties surrounding the price path remained high in the short term, and there were upward inflationary pressures from energy conversion and contracted global supply chains, as well as downward pressures from population aging, debt growth and technological innovation from a long-term perspective.",
        "The member thus saw the need to thoroughly review the relevant developments going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that debt risk for vulnerable households could increase, affected by a Base Rate hike and tighter regulations including debt service ratio (DSR) rules differentiated by borrower.",
        "The member thus added that it would be necessary to continuously monitor the relevant risks, while stepping up policy efforts to improve the qualitative structure of debt.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate from Looking at changes in the domestic and overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member judged that the global economy was continuing its underlying recovery trend, despite combined developments of various risk factors.",
        "However, the member noted that with inflation increasing rapidly, the recovery momentum was weakening and economic uncertainties had heightened in most countries including Korea.",
        "The member stressed that factors such as growing geopolitical risks from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the spread of the Omicron variant in the Asian region, and the Chinese government’s “zero-COVID” policy could not only directly limit economic growth, but also lead to rising production costs and a decrease in real purchasing power through inflationary pressures caused by supply disruptions, and thus have greatly expanded negative spillover effects.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member noted the following factors that were considered in making the monetary policy decision.",
        "First, the member evaluated that inflation expectations were continuing to spread as the trend of inflation far exceeding the target had become more likely to persist for a long time.",
        "The member stated that the impacts on prices of geopolitical risks and disease control measures tended of course to be mostly temporary, limiting their implications for monetary policy.",
        "However, the member commented that the pressures on domestic inflation had broadly increased as recent supply shock had occurred in the midst of already prolonged rises in international commodity prices and it was combined with the depreciation of the won stemming from the spread of global risk aversion.",
        "The member added that the interaction from wages to prices through a rise in inflation expectations could already have begun, as second-round effects into other items were materializing in full due to the combined effects of cyclical and structural factors, employment conditions were recovering, and the pace of wage increases was accelerating in some industries of late.",
        "Second, the member judged that, although downside risks to growth were growing, they had not yet been undermining the underlying recovery.",
        "The member saw that exports and manufacturing production remained relatively robust, while economic recovery had slowed, particularly in private consumption, due to the rapid spread of Omicron in the first quarter.",
        "The member evaluated that private consumption was showing a sign of renewed improvement, albeit modest, bolstered by the relaxing of disease control measures, and the partial slowing of the spread of COVID-19, although recent supply chain disruptions and the heightened possibility of global economic slowdown were exerting a drag on the outlook for exports.",
        "The member thus judged that the trend of recovery exceeding the potential growth rate would likely to continue this year, as in the previous year, while the output gap was likely to shift into positive territory not much later than the originally forecast.",
        "Third, the member evaluated that, despite the three Base Rate hikes since August last year, monetary policy still remained accommodative.",
        "The member estimated that, although financial conditions had become less accommodative, due to a steep rise in market interest rates entering this year, the real Base Rate had fallen below the average for last year and was running considerably below the neutral interest rate.",
        "Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member assessed that growth in household lending and housing prices had slowed since the second half of last year, but continued caution about the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances was required.",
        "The member mentioned that destabilizing factors remained, as the household debt-to-income ratio and housing price-to-income ratio continued to be above their long-term trends and higher than those of major countries due to the accumulation of leverage, while financial institutions had somewhat eased their lending attitudes, and housing price sentiment had stopped declining recently amid ample market liquidity.",
        "Furthermore, the member expressed the view that, since the FX sector could remain highly volatile and work to destabilize financial markets for some time due to changes in expectations of major country monetary policies, external soundness should be a matter of policy concern as well.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member evaluated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member argued that, despite concerns about the fact that downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation had been growing at the same time at home and abroad, stabilizing inflation expectations and curbing the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances through continued effort to return to a neutral monetary policy stance was a choice that would meet policy objectives over the medium- and long-term horizon, considering growth would likely continue to exceed its potential level.",
        "The member also noted that, keeping in mind that credit risk of vulnerable sectors could increase in the course of monetary policy normalization, it would be necessary to manage related risks preemptively through coordination with fiscal and financial policies.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member assessed that, although the global economic recovery had slowed somewhat affected by the Ukraine crisis, the US economy had maintained strong growth in terms of employment and consumption and global trade had also sustained modest growth.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that the number of persons employed remained on a sharp rise and exports continued to be strong, while the recovery in facilities and construction investment had been delayed due to supply-side factors.",
        "The member added that private consumption had been also returning to the path of recovery since March, as people had been adapting to the pandemic situation.",
        "With regard to the FX and financial sectors, the member assessed that the domestic financial system remained sound while major economic variables had become more volatile due to common uncertainties at home and abroad such as geopolitical risks, the monetary policy directions of major countries, and pandemic-related developments.",
        "The member stressed that the top consideration in the current Base Rate decision was movements of inflation variables.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had stood at 4.1% in March, exceeding 4% for the first time since 2011, and that core inflation had also reached 2.9%.",
        "The member added that, although the long-term inflation expectations of an expert group had not yet deviated far from the inflation target, the short-term inflation expectations of the general public had risen to The member noted that uncertainties remained with regard to the depth and duration of the shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which had begun on the day of the BOK’s February MPB meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that, looking at its impact on the economy so far, the invasion had put downward pressures on the real economy, although these repurcussions were not as large as expected and uncertainties were high, but the invasion had put massive and conspicuous upward pressures on inflation.",
        "The member noted that, since a rise in commodity prices does not spread to import prices, producer prices and then to consumer prices with a time lag but rather commodity prices move in concert with other prices, a surge in energy and grain prices was spreading rapidly to domestic prices, and a rise in grain prices in particular could have a long-term effect.",
        "The member added that a growing number of core and non-core inflation items had all been exhibiting growth of 2% or higher.",
        "The member assessed that, with these factors taken into account, consumer price inflation was forecast to remain in the 4% range for the time being and consumer price inflation for the year as a whole was likely to exceed the February forecast of 3.1%.",
        "The member mentioned that a close watch should be kept not only on the above-mentioned spread but also on the possibility of a secondary effect in which inflation leads to a rise in wages.",
        "The member evaluated that special payments had contributed most to wage increases during 2021, but toward the end of the year, regular payments, which tend to be persistent, had made an increasingly large contribution and the trend of wage growth had been spreading to various industries.",
        "The member noted that in this situation most indicators that affect wages had returned to their pre-pandemic levels, including inflation expectations and the job vacancy rate, as well as the employment rate, jobless claims and working hours that indicate slack in the labor market.",
        "The member presented the view that this could mean a recovery in the real economy but could also lead to wage increases, causing further rises in prices of some items such as personal services.",
        "The member mentioned that a rise in market interest rates following a Base Rate hike could limit the momentum of economic recovery.",
        "The member however emphasized that both historical experience and economic theory indicate that stabilizing inflation expectations is essential in responding to negative price shocks and that the monetary authorities should send a clear signal in this regard.",
        "The member noted that, even if raised this time, the Base Rate would remain accommodative relative to real economic conditions.",
        "The member added that a Base Rate hike also remained crucial in a scenario in which the growth forecast had been adjusted downward and the inflation forecast upward in reflection of the Ukraine crisis.",
        "The member assessed that the real economy would be able to endure a Base Rate hike given the positive effects that future easing of disease-control measures would have on private consumption and employment.",
        "The member argued that with all this taken into consideration it would be advisable for now to deal with the more obvious and conspicuous risk of inflation.",
        "The member stated that particular attention should be kept to price-related variables in determining the monetary policy stance but macro-prudence also required special attention.",
        "The member mentioned that, on the domestic front, attention should be paid to financial imbalances arising from the housing market.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the housing market had been gradually stabilizing recently, with lending to households decreasing slightly and housing prices and leasehold deposits declining slightly as well.",
        "The member added that Base Rate increases had been working to curb demand for loans due to rising costs.",
        "In quantitative terms, however, the member noted that there remained a possibility of a rise in lending to households, led by leasehold deposit loans.",
        "The member also mentioned that there were incentives for financial institutions to expand lending since the rate of growth in household lending was below the annual administered target.",
        "The member stressed the need to keep a close watch on future developments of lending and housing prices in this context and went on to emphasize that it would be necessary to carefully monitor any yield-seeking behavior.",
        "Concerning macro-prudence in the external sector, the member mentioned that, looking back at previous experiences, attention should be paid to sudden changes in capital flows and the exchange rate.",
        "The member assessed that foreign reserves were currently abundant, the short-term external debt ratio was relatively low, the banking sector was maintaining a favorable level of soundness, and the correlation coefficient of flows of funds for bond investment in Korea and emerging market countries had decreased, all of which could be seen as positive factors.",
        "The member however noted that risk factors also existed, such as the prolongation of geopolitical risks and potential shocks that could arise over the course of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that there was a need to prepare for a weakening of China’s growth due to its stronger measures against COVID-19 and the impact of possible monetary easing in response.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to Concerning the global economy, the member judged that the recovery of growth had been slower than previously expected and the uptrend in prices had been accelerating.",
        "The member mentioned that this was attributable to the worsening of trade and supply disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war, amid the growing pressure for major central banks to normalize their accommodative monetary policy stance with supply bottlenecks and a strong recovery in demand since the pandemic leading to further inflation.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member assessed prices as rising at a faster pace than previously forecast.",
        "The member noted that, in the underlying inflation situation in which inflationary pressure was expanding into a wide range of items, global oil and commodity prices were acting as further upward pressures on prices due to the Ukraine crisis, and went on to state that inflation expectations had already risen close to 3%.",
        "The member expected that the domestic economic growth forecast for this year would be lowered somewhat from the previous forecast (3.0%) due to the slow recovery during the first quarter, but the economy would sustain its sound recovery later on, boosted by improvements in consumption and strong exports.",
        "As to private consumption, the member mentioned that, although hit by a surge in virus infections and quarantines, the mobility index and the amount of credit card usage had improved since mid-March, and went on to argue that, boosted by favorable household income conditions, private consumption was likely to sustain its recovery in line with a gradual return to everyday life, led by face-to-face consumption such as leisure activities.",
        "The member stated that a recovery in facilities investment was limited by global supply disruptions and anticipated that a recovery in construction investment would be delayed longer than originally expected owing to a delay in material supply.",
        "The member assessed that exports would maintain favorable growth based on strong demand from major economies.",
        "The member noted that employment continued to improve, with the number of persons employed rising significantly and the unemployment rate declining, and that upward pressures on wages seemed to be strengthening gradually.",
        "With regard to the financial markets, the member noted that Treasury bond yields had risen significantly, affected by the Federal Reserve’s recent monetary policy decision.",
        "The member mentioned that credit to the corporate sector had been exhibiting strong growth and financial institutions’ lending attitudes had been easing, while banks’ lending to households continued to slow.",
        "The member evaluated that significantly negative short-term real interest rates and the continued strong growth in market liquidity suggested that financial conditions remained accommodative.",
        "The member assessed that the most-watched aspect of recent domestic and overseas economic developments was the escalating inflation and its sustainability.",
        "The member judged that the sharp rise in inflation at home and abroad since the middle of last year had been attributable mainly to supply-side factors, but a surge in liquidity and increased demand in line with accommodative monetary and fiscal policies had been also responsible.",
        "The member presented the view that, given the additional and sustainable impact on price conditions of structural dynamics at this turning point of the global economy, such as changes in the geopolitical environment including the emergence of a new cold war, demographic change, a reorganization of global value chains, changes in investment and trade patterns, and climate change, attention should be paid to the possibility of the underlying inflationary pressure that had been spreading so far becoming more than a transitory phenomenon.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation expectations of the general public had been growing recently along with the continued uptrend in prices, and went on to state that in order to prevent this from imposing an additional burden on the future path of the domestic economy and also on monetary policy options, preemptive measures needed to be taken for stable management of inflation expectations.",
        "The member also assessed that the Federal Reseve could normalize its monetary policy faster and to a greater extent than expected a couple of months earlier, and in this regard attention should be paid to consequent potential pressures from the FX sector and possible restriction on domestic monetary policy.",
        "The member also stressed the need to ensure monetary policy space in advance to respond more effectively to changes in the domestic economic situation.",
        "Taking all this into comprehensive consideration, the member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50% from the current 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member expected that a Base Rate hike was unlikely to limit the momentum of economic recovery as the spread of the pandemic slows and disease-control measures are eased gradually.",
        "Concerning the future monetary policy direction, the member noted that it would be necessary to further adjust the degree of monetary easing at an appropriate pace while closely monitoring changes in economic and price conditions at home and abroad, whether inflation expectations are firmly anchored, and financial stability conditions.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%.",
        "`□` Currently available information suggests that inflation has accelerated while the recovery of the global economy has somewhat moderated, affected by the Ukraine crisis.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have risen sharply and the US dollar has strengthened, mainly due to changes in expectations about the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s policy normalization.",
        "Stock prices have rebounded after a considerable decline.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board expects that the global economy will resume its trend of recovery, supported by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in major countries, but sees it as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks.",
        "`□` The Korean economy has continued to recover.",
        "Exports have sustained their buoyancy while facilities investment has slowed due to global supply constraints.",
        "Private consumption has recently shown modest improvement thanks to the easing of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, after having moderated.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its recovery albeit partly affected by the Ukraine crisis, as exports are expected to continue their solid trend of growth while private consumption is likely to improve.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the February forecast of `□` Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to the lower-4% level due to soaring prices of petroleum products as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of industrial products and personal services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the upper-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 4% range for some time, and run substantially above the February forecast of 3.1% for the year overall.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to remain around 3% for a considerable time.",
        "`□` In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have risen significantly while stock prices have fluctuated considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have fallen slightly, especially in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "`□` The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties in domestic and external conditions.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and the trends of growth and inflation.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (October 2022),[2)] _FX_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that, despite the ongoing recovery in private consumption driven by consumption of services, and robust employment conditions, economic growth was weakening somewhat, due mainly to economic slowdowns in major countries and slowing export growth following adjustments to business conditions in the semiconductor sector.",
        "Meanwhile, some members expected the slowing economic trends to deepen somewhat next year, affected by external conditions and a tightening monetary policy stance.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed that there still were upside risks, due to the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, and faster rises in underlying price indicators, although consumer price inflation had declined somewhat after reaching a peak in July.",
        "Some members stated that the Base Rate should be raised to exceed the neutral interest rate somewhat, given the asymmetry in that the exchange rate pass-through to inflation becomes higher during a high inflation period and in consideration of inflation still running substantially above the target level.",
        "In addition, members stated that long-term market interest rates had risen significantly and stock prices had fallen due to strengthened risk aversion in the domestic financial market.",
        "Members noted that, despite worsened corporate bond issuance conditions, corporations’ funding through bank lending appeared to remain seamless.",
        "Meanwhile, some members saw that, while the strength of the foreign exchange market against external shocks was judged to be solid at the moment, it would be necessary to prepare for instability in the external sector stemming from the worsening of global financial conditions, such as sustained depreciation pressures on the won following the strengthening of the US dollar going forward, the narrowing current account surplus, and possible foreign capital outflows following the widening gap between domestic and overseas interest rates.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to the risks of the widening of credit premiums of domestic bonds and rises in market interest rates in line with the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, as well as credit and liquidity risks of non-bank financial institutions following the worsening of the soundness of project financing loans.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 3.00% from the current 2.50%, while some members argued for raising it to 2.75% from the current 2.5%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.75% from the current 2.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that global economic growth had been slowing rapidly due to the increasing uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine crisis and to further global monetary tightening in response to inflation.",
        "The member mentioned that growth in global goods trade had been slowing gradually and recently global services trade had also started to slow.",
        "The member evaluated that the Korean economy had sustained a modest recovery but its growth had been weakening overall as the global economic slowdown had become evident.",
        "The member took the view that exports and investment had remained sluggish and private consumption was unlikely to sustain growth owing to the persistent high inflation and high interest rates as well as concerns about an economic recession.",
        "The member mentioned that there was little likelihood of employment continuing to improve, given that the mismatch between production and employment was unlikely to last long and that employment tended to lag economic activity somewhat.",
        "The member noted that the consumer price inflation remained at a high level above energy had recorded 4.0% year on year in the third quarter and was highly likely to decline to the upper-3% level at year-end or in the first quarter next year owing to a base-period effect and the slowdown of domestic demand, suggesting that the steep rise might have slowed, but there was no denying that inflation remained at a high level.",
        "The member pointed to the need to pay attention to changes compared to previous periods as well as the annual growth rate to determine whether inflation would rise further or cool down.",
        "Concerning the FX sector, meanwhile, the member judged that there was increasing wariness of the sharp rise in won-dollar exchange rate volatility.",
        "More specifically, the member noted the growing concerns about a prolongation and widening of the inversion of the US and Korean policy rates.",
        "The member however presented the view that it would be also necessary to fully understand the possibility of rate hikes aimed at stabilizing the FX market accelerating the domestic economic downturn and causing financial instability, and to develop measures in response.",
        "The member assessed that growth in credit to the private sector had been slowing gradually due to the combined effects of increases in market and lending rates and economic contractions at home and abroad, and that stock, real estate and other asset markets had remained sluggish.",
        "The member judged that demand pressures might decrease further since the rate hikes, which had begun 14 months ago, had started to take evident effect and monetary tightening had not yet come to an end.",
        "The member meanwhile noted that we had passed the stage where vigilance against further inflationary pressures was required, since the supply shortage had been eased gradually.",
        "The member however assessed that, considering that inflation remained far above its target, it would be necessary to continue raising the rate for some time, but at a gradual pace.",
        "The member assessed that, without any changes in other conditions, the lower-3% level would be the upper limit of the Base Rate that would help stabilize core inflation at around 2% over a medium-term horizon without causing economic activities and employment to contract excessively, and that once the Base Rate reaches that level, the central bank should examine how fast inflation is declining and whether it will converge to the target in making monetary policy decisions.",
        "The member stressed that it was difficult to respond to irregular exchange rate fluctuations in a consistent manner by adjusting the Base Rate and that, unless faced with a critical situation such as sudden capital outflows and a fall in Korea’s international credit standing, priority consideration should be given to the domestic economy, inflation and financial stability conditions.",
        "The member mentioned however that, in case of excessive herd behavior at odds with economic fundamentals, aggressive employment of market stabilization measures including further Base Rate hikes would be required to help stabilize market expectations and sentiment.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.00% from the current 2.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that, although the trend of economic recovery had slowed markedly in major countries of late, affected by the acceleration of monetary tightening, prices were sustaining their strong uptrend, as international oil prices were remaining at a high level and the effects on economic conditions were felt after a time gap.",
        "The member stated that, while growth of the Korean economy, and that of exports in particular, was weakening rapidly due to economic slowdowns in major countries and adjustments to business conditions for the semiconductor sector, inflation remained highly elevated at the mid- to upper-5% level.",
        "The member judged that while consumer price inflation had declined somewhat after reaching a peak in July, upside risks to inflation over the next one year appeared to have increased further in consideration of the effects of the rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate so far, and increases in prices of personal services.",
        "The member presented the view that inflation would be highly persistent, as trends of increase in various underlying inflation indicators, such as core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI), weighted median CPI, and sticky prices, were actually accelerating.",
        "The member mentioned that, in the financial markets, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate and long-term market interest rates had risen substantially and stock prices had fallen, as faster-than-expected tightening by the US Federal Reserve led to the strengthening of the US dollar and stronger preferences for safe-haven assets.",
        "The member judged the foreign capital market to remain stable overall, as rises in short-term foreign currency borrowing premiums and CDS premiums for foreign exchange stabilization bonds remained lower in Korea than in major emerging market countries.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that, despite a narrower current account surplus and a decline in the volume of investment in Korean securities by foreigners, it was still too early to say that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions had worsened severely, as capital outflows by retail investors investing in overseas stocks in particular had fallen sharply.",
        "The member judged strength against external shocks to remain solid in light of major improvements in currency and maturity mismatch issues thanks to foreign exchange-related macroprudential measures, with net external assets increasing substantially in the public and private sectors since the global financial crisis.",
        "However, the member stressed that depreciation pressures on the won stemming from self-fulfilling expectations appeared to be ongoing, with private demand for the US dollar in the spot and futures markets growing and net outflows of foreign bond investment funds increasing due to widely spreading expectations that the won would depreciate excessively relative to fundamentals, affected by the deprecation of the yuan and the yen.",
        "The member mentioned that based on an analysis made by the Financial Market Department, the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was also working to increase market interest rates at home through the widening of credit premiums for domestic bonds and decreased values of collateral for financial institutions’ FX derivatives transactions.",
        "Taking into overall consideration these domestic economic, price, financial and foreign exchange conditions, the member saw that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, which is a bigger-than-usual hike, at this meeting to proactively deal with inflationary pressures and herd behavior in expectations for the foreign exchange sector.",
        "The member stressed the need to maintain a monetary policy stance which focuses on curbing inflation, as the price gap remained high and the growth gap remained close to zero.",
        "The member judged that the economy would be able to withstand the growth loss stemming from rate hikes in light of the prospect that domestic demand would maintain relatively solid growth next year as well as this year.",
        "The member expressed the view that a significant Base Rate hike would be of help to ease one-directional expectations for the foreign exchange market.",
        "The member commented that, if the current path forecast continued to hold that inflation would fall at a slow pace, the Board would maintain its monetary tightening stance, while flexibly determining the size and pace of further Base Rate increases depending on domestic and overseas economic and financial conditions going forward.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.75% from the current 2.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member judged that global economic growth was slowing rapidly, as the terminal Federal Funds rate was projected to be higher than the August forecast due to the continuation of the strong tightening stance by the US Federal Reserve, and the pace of policy rate increase at major central banks was accelerating.",
        "The member saw that growth in the domestic economy was slowing and growth for next year was highly likely to be lower than the latest forecast.",
        "The member noted that labor market conditions were showing favorable movements overall with the number of persons employed maintaining its substantial uptrend and the unemployment rate remaining low.",
        "However, the member expected the uptrend in the number of persons employed to slow next year, affected by the slowdown in the real economy.",
        "The member stated that core inflation was continuing to rise, led by prices of personal services such as dining out, and nominal wages were continuing to rise at a fast pace.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that core inflation and the rate of increase in wages would decline due to worsened labor conditions stemming from the slowdown in economic growth.",
        "The member stated that it would be desirable to maintain the tightening monetary policy stance given the upward trend in underlying inflation, but judged that it would be appropriate to avoid an excessive degree of tightening.",
        "The member commented that, as the Base Rate hikes so far were expected to gradually influence the real economy, and as the world economy would enter a recession phase next year that would greatly affect Korea, a small and open economy, excessive Base Rate hikes would have only limited impacts on price stability in the short term and would put additional downward pressures on the growth path, in combination with external risk factors, in the medium term.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that the soundness of the external sector was partially weakening due to a significant rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate in the foreign exchange market.",
        "The member judged that, although the policy rate gap between Korea and the US was widening further and the vigilance against the ensuing increase in capital outflow pressures was growing, domestic monetary policy had only limited impacts on the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member analyzed that the recently rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was driven by a strong US dollar trend and was affected by a combination of factors such as the interest rate gap between domestic and overseas rates, the trade account, and depreciation of the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.",
        "The member judged that it would be reasonable to adjust the pace of tightening depending on capital flow conditions, given that Korea had generally seen sustained net inflows of foreign domestic bond investment funds during the past inversions of the US and Korean policy rates.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that, since the rising exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices might not be large in Korea, the impacts of the exchange rate rise on inflation at home were unlikely to be as great as feared.",
        "The member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by of these economic conditions at home and abroad and suggested a few reasons for this judgment.",
        "The member first saw that it would be desirable to maintain the tightening stance to cope with the underlying high inflation trend.",
        "Second, the member expected growth in the domestic economy to slow considerably from mid- or late-2023, the time when the recent monetary policy decisions were expected to affect the real economy, considering the time lag in monetary policy transmission.",
        "Third, the member presented the opinion that, from the perspective of managing risks to the real economy and the price path, it would be more desirable to conduct monetary policy flexibly depending on economic developments, than to implement it preemptively due to concerns about capital outflows and the rising exchange rate, since the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates had only limited impacts on the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member stated that it would be desirable to adjust the pace of tightening, while looking at the future domestic price and growth paths, capital flow trends, global financial market conditions, and changes in monetary policy in major countries.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member judged that the domestic economy was still maintaining its steady pace of growth, although it was weakening somewhat in the second half of this year.",
        "The member stated that this was mainly because private consumption was showing sound growth, which more than offset the slowdown in the pace of increase in exports.",
        "In particular, the member added that labor market conditions were showing very favorable movements with the number of persons employed showing a substantial increase and wages maintaining a solid upward trend.",
        "However, the member expected the domestic economy to grow more slowly, affected by sluggish global growth and worsened domestic and international financial conditions.",
        "On the price front, the member assessed that, while consumer price inflation had fallen slightly since July, underlying inflation including core inflation had actually accelerated further.",
        "The member noted that the steep uptrend in consumer prices continued due to pass-through of the steeply rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate to prices, and the underlying uptrend of prices including core inflation had accelerated due to the spread of the uptrend in prices to personal service items.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to decrease next year, but saw that the size and pace of the decline could be different from what had been expected.",
        "On the financial stability side, the member assessed that the domestic financial market was showing solid resilience from and capacity to adjust to shocks such as the recent steep interest rate hikes, as the built-up financial imbalances at home had been eased.",
        "The member commented that household lending was showing stability this year, acting a backdrop to seamless corporate funding despite worsened corporate bond issuance conditions following the recent rises in bond yields.",
        "In the external sector, the member added that the supply and demand imbalances in the foreign exchange market seen since last year, caused by worsened trade conditions, were partially easing, thanks to a recent decrease in overseas portfolio investment by residents.",
        "However, the member stated that the steep rise in market interest rates and the strong US dollar trend were substantially destabilizing the foreign exchange market through the rising won to dollar exchange rate and capital outflow pressures.",
        "The member saw that the financial market had started to face a won liquidity burden following a soar in the exchange rate, on top of rising market interest rates.",
        "The member commented that credit risk aversion was heightening in some sectors including project financing loans, with housing prices continuing to decline.",
        "The member stressed the need to focus on stabilizing the value of the won first, as prices and the exchange rate had become volatile simultaneously due to worsening macroeconomic imbalances between the domestic and external sectors, and, as a result, financial stability was threatened.",
        "The member first expressed the opinion that the recent rise in prices was affected by demand-side factors led by core inflation, which suggested the need for proactive policy actions in response.",
        "The member commented that, given that it would be difficult to reduce inflationary pressures and stabilize inflation expectations with the Base Rate in the neutral range alone, and that the recently heightened exchange rate volatility was affected by the acceleration of tightening by the US Federal Reserve, it would be necessary to firmly secure market participants’ confidence in the real value of the won, by presenting the Bank of Korea’s firm intention and outlook for achieving price stability through appropriate Base Rate hikes.",
        "Given these points, the member presented the need to speed up Base Rate hikes to switch the policy stance to a tighter level early and maintain the tighter level until price stability could be judged to be firmly anchored.",
        "The member added that such a preemptive monetary policy stance would boost domestic and international confidence in the value of the won, thus contributing to the heightening of financial market resilience against a shock from heightened volatility in the international financial market, by ensuring stability in the macroeconomy and the easing of leverage.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.00% from the current 2.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had been slowing, affected by high inflation and accelerating monetary tightening.",
        "The member assessed that most countries had been witnessing inflation remaining high far above the price stability target and, in response to this, major countries had been aggressive in strengthening monetary tightening, the impact of which was being gradually felt in consumption and production.",
        "The member mentioned that domestic economic growth had been slowing, influenced by a slowdown in exports.",
        "The member forecast that, although private consumption had sustained a recovery led by face-to-face services consumption, the pace of recovery would slow gradually in line with inflation and the weakening effect of excess household savings.",
        "The member noted that, amid sluggish demand from major trading partners for goods imports, exports had remained sluggish affected by a slowdown in the global semiconductor industry.",
        "The member mentioned that facilities investment was unlikely to sustain its improvement due to the economic slowdown, and construction investment had remained sluggish affected by soaring commodity prices and falling housing prices.",
        "The member projected that GDP growth for this year would be similar to the previous forecast, but the economic slowdown was likely to deepen somewhat next year.",
        "With regard to prices, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had recorded 5.6% in September with personal services charges sustaining their strong uptrend, and that core inflation had risen slightly to 4.1%.",
        "The member expected that, although its sharp rise had been weakening recently, inflation would run at the mid-5% level for the time being, considering pressures on domestic inflation in line with the rising won-dollar exchange rate and the uptrend in charges for personal services with strong downward rigidity.",
        "The member noted that housing prices had declined, affected largely by rising interest rates.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member mentioned that, affected by stronger risk-off sentiment, interest rates had risen signficantly while stock prices had fallen, and that the significant upward adjustment of the US Fed terminal rate forecasts had caused the won-dollar rate to rise and triggered net foreign portfolio investment fund outflows.",
        "The member noted that bank lending to the household sector had declined slightly and, concerning corporate funding, corporate bond issuance had been sluggish while borrowings from banks had maintained strong growth.",
        "The member assessed that the financial markets had shown somewhat unstable movements overall, which was attributable to the combined effect of various factors including the trade deficit and global financial market unrest.",
        "The member presented the view that the Korean won’s depreciation since August has been particularly notable compared to US dollar index’s rise, and that careful attention should be paid to the factors responsible for this.",
        "The member assessed that, in overall consideration of these domestic and international economic environments, it was time to stay on the alert against growing downside risks to the economy and the spread and persistence of high inflation.",
        "The member added that caution was required with respect to the possibility of a widening of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates working to cause instability in the FX sector and acting as additional inflationary pressures.",
        "The member mentioned that a slowdown in Korea’s exports, which had benefited from extraordinary factors such as growth in transfer income in major countries since the spread of COVID-19, could be seen as an adjustment amid the post-pandemic return to normal, and went on to state that since domestic consumption had been sustaining growth led by face-to-face services, a drastic slowdown in consumption growth was unlikely for now.",
        "The member expressed the view that, at present, a key priority of macroeconomic policy should be placed on curbing the spread of inflation expectations and reducing inflationary pressures through the exchange rate channel, and added that the Base Rate should be hiked to a level somewhat above the neutral interest rate.",
        "The member noted that the size and pace of future rate hikes should be determined in consideration of economic and interest rate paths in major countries, domestic economic growth and inflation trends, financial stability conditions and the resilience of the entire financial system.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member forecast domestic economic growth to slow gradually, with the global economic slowdown continuing and global trade growth slowing.",
        "The member nevertheless expressed support for a 50 basis point hike due to the strong need to respond to persistent high inflation and pursue financial and FX market stability.",
        "The member noted that there existed upside risks to consumer price inflation, such as the ongoing high exchange rate and further reduction in production by major oil producing countries, and that underlying inflation indicators continued to rise.",
        "The member stated that there was still not enough evidence to judge that inflation had passed its peak, and that, even if so, there was little likelihood that inflation would decline to its medium-term target soon, and argued that considering all this monetary tightening seemed urgently needed.",
        "The member called for attention to the exchange rate’s impact on prices and its destabilizing role in financial markets, mentioning that the exchange rate could add to inflationary pressures through import prices.",
        "The member also noted that, unlike in the past, the exchange rate had a weaker effect of enhancing exports due to increased participation in GVCs and the high proportion of trade settlement in US dollars.",
        "Concerning the FX market as well, the member mentioned that the worsening inversion of the US and Korean policy rates and increasing overseas investment by pension funds had worked to limit the effect of reducing net capital outflows when the exchange rate increases.",
        "The member also presented the view that the asymmetry whereby the exchange rate pass-through into prices was higher when the exchange rate was rising and inflation was high, as they currently were, should also be considered.",
        "The member noted that the recent high won-dollar rate was working to destabilize the financial markets and was therefore also related to one of the Bank of Korea’s mandates.",
        "The member mentioned that the exchange rate and capital flows were affected mostly by economic conditions and external conditions, but the impact of the interest rate differential could not be ignored.",
        "The member noted that, looking at past examples and empirical analysis results, the larger the extent to which a country’s policy rate is raised, the less its currency depreciates, and interest rate differentials affected foreign investment in Korea and overseas investment by Korean residents.",
        "The member took the view that, since policy uncertainties concerning exchange rate instability could distort economic agents’ decision-making regarding consumption and investment and cause herd behavior, various efforts should be made to stabilize the financial and FX markets.",
        "The member assessed that the largest concern with regard to raising the Base Rate was the possibility of an unintended, excessive economic downturn, but at this point in time, the Korean economy appeared to be able to tolerate the current interest rate level and the rate hike stance that could last for some time.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that private consumption had been recovering led by the services sector and about 10% of total private consumption had come from the excess savings that had accumulated during the pandemic period, which could support consumption amid negative shocks.",
        "Regarding the current account, the member mentioned that the trade account deficit was worrisome, but considering its dependence on energy imports, Korea’s current account to GDP ratio was more favorable than those of major countries and Korea’s ratio of the current account to GDP excluding energy was even higher than those of major countries.",
        "The member noted that vigilance against systemic risk in terms of household debt could increase due to the ongoing rate hike stance and added that sectors vulnerable to rate hikes required close monitoring and preemptive measures.",
        "First, the member emphasized that soundness of project financing loans was highly likely to worsen in line with a fall in housing prices and an increase in unsold new housing, and that it would be necessary to closely examine credit and liquidity risks at non-bank financial institutions with a high proportion of project financing loans.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to preemptively come up with financial support measures for vulnerable borrowers with weak debt-servicing capacity and SMEs with little access to financial services.",
        "The member also pointed to the recent rise in short-term foreign currency borrowing premiums and the CDS premiums for foreign exchange stabilization bonds and presented the view that FX swap market conditions and external soundness indicators should be closely monitored to ensure that Korea’s international credit standing is favorable.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Joo, Sangyong and Mr. Shin, Sung Hwan expressed clear opposition to the idea of raising the Base Rate by 0.50 of a percentage point and argued for a 25 basis point hike.",
        "Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 2.50% to 3.00%.",
        "The Board judges that the policy response should be strengthened, as additional inflationary pressures and the risks to the foreign exchange sector have increased affected by the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, while inflation has remained high.",
        "continued, affected by the ongoing high inflation, further tightening of the US Federal Reserve's policy stance and the prolonged Ukraine crisis.",
        "In global financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and stock prices have fallen, and financial unrest has emerged in some countries, while major currencies have depreciated due to the reinforced trend of US dollar strength.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, and geopolitical risks.",
        "consumption has maintained its recovery trend.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to slow gradually, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates.",
        "GDP growth for this year will be generally consistent with the August forecast of 2.6%, but that for next year is projected to be below the August forecast of 2.1%.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-5% range due to the accelerating price increases in personal services and processed food products, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have moderated.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high in the 4% range.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 5-6% range for a considerable time as the impact of the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate acts as additional inflationary pressure.",
        "Consumer price inflation will be generally consistent with the August forecast of the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate and production cuts by major oil-producing countries, despite downward pressures from the economic slowdown.",
        "exchange sector, as the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly and foreigners’ securities investment funds have shown net outflows, influenced by the strong US dollar and the weak yen and yuan.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have risen considerably and stock prices have fallen sharply.",
        "Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have further decreased.",
        "consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, although domestic economic activity has slowed.",
        "In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, monetary policy changes in major countries, financial stability conditions such as capital flows, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (Aug 2022),[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that, despite sluggish exports in line with weakening global demand, the domestic economy had sustained growth above its potential level, boosted by a recovery in private consumption following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and by continued robust employment conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, some members noted that uncertainties surrounding external conditions, such as the Ukraine crisis and policy stances of major central banks, existed on the future growth path.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed that inflation had accelerated as demand-side pressures as well as supply-side pressures, such as a rise in commodity prices, geopolitical risks and the rising exchange rate, had been acting as upward pressures on core inflation.",
        "Some of the members judged that, although short-term inflation expectations had recently declined slightly and long-term inflation expectations had been anchored, there were growing concerns about inflation persistence, considering the interaction between inflation and wages and changes in economic behavior in a high inflation environment.",
        "Some members stressed the need to maintain the current stance to help anchor inflation expectations and prevent high inflation from being entrenched.",
        "In addition, members assessed that the domestic financial markets had been stable overall and financial imbalances that had accumulated so far had been easing somewhat.",
        "Some of the members emphasized that it would be necessary to prepare against growing instability of the external sector due to the worsening global financial conditions including the rising won-dollar exchange rate in line with the strengthening US dollar, the narrowing current account surplus and a possible foreign capital outflow owing to the widening gap between domestic and overseas interest rates.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to the impact of a global economic recession on the domestic economy, labor market conditions in major countries and individual industries, and foreign currency liquidity risks following a growing supply-demand imbalance in the swap market.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member judged that the domestic economy was still maintaining growth exceeding its potential.",
        "The member stated that, while the pace of increase in exports was easing and facilities investment was continuing to undergo an adjustment, private consumption was showing sound growth.",
        "The member added that labor market conditions were showing favorable movements with the number of persons employed showing a substantial increase and wages maintaining a solid upward trend.",
        "The member expected these growth trends to continue for some time, while the Research Department projected growth for the second half of this year to be in the mid-2% range and expected growth slightly exceeding its potential to continue for next year.",
        "However, the member saw that there were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path associated with the Ukraine crisis, the policy stances of major country central banks, and economic slowdowns in major countries including China.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to these points.",
        "On the price front, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had risen further to the lower-6% range in July, despite declines in petroleum product prices.",
        "The member judged that, while consumer price inflation was expected to fall gradually after the fourth quarter of this year in consideration of a base effect, its peak could be delayed or it could fall slowly.",
        "Looking at external conditions, the member stated that a risk of rises in energy and grocery prices stemming for instance from the Ukraine crisis and climate change remained, and the significantly risen Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had been acting as cost-side upward pressure.",
        "The member noted that growth exceeding its potential was continuing to drive up demand-side inflationary pressures, and upward pressure on public utility fees had been built up after having been contained so far.",
        "The member emphasized in particular the concerning possibility of greatly heightened inflation expectations accelerating the upward trend of inflation through for instance wages.",
        "The member took the view that it would be necessary to keep a close watch on the possibility that the high inflation phase could be prolonged due to the increased persistence of inflation if such destabilizing factors at home and abroad persisted.",
        "On the financial stability side, the member assessed that the substantially built-up financial imbalances at home had been reduced somewhat, as domestic market interest rates and stock prices had been showing stability of late, household lending had reversed to a slight decline, and housing prices were falling modestly.",
        "However, the member commented that destabilizing factors remained in the external sector, as the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate remained high due to US dollar strengthening, and the current account surplus was narrowing due to worsened trade conditions.",
        "Taking all these into consideration, the member judged that the biggest threat facing the domestic economy for the moment was the entrenchment of the high inflation phase.",
        "The member commented that, most importantly, high inflation would decrease real income, thus posing a threat to the basic livelihood of the low-income vulnerable group, while bringing about substantial harmful consequences by for instance distorting the consumption and investment decisions of economic agents through changes in expectations about real returns.",
        "The member stressed that if high inflation became firmly entrenched, a large growth loss would be unavoidable going forward, and the external soundness of the Korean economy would be undermined through the further weakening of the won and increased capital outflow pressures.",
        "The member thus presented the view that the challenge for monetary policy would be preventing the high inflation phase from taking root in the domestic economy.",
        "The member commented that the Base Rate appeared to have now reached the neutral range as the Bank of Korea had been reducing the accommodative monetary policy stance since August last year.",
        "However, the member judged that it would be necessary to maintain the Base Rate hike stance for some time to control inflationary pressures in the domestic economy and high inflation expectations.",
        "The member took the view that firmly securing market confidence by reconfirming the Bank of Korea’s will and capability to achieve price stability domestically and internationally through the maintenance of a consistent policy stance would be a very important task.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member judged that the economic trend was slowing somewhat, due to the combined effects of various risk factors, such as high inflation and delayed recovery in global supply chains.",
        "The member added that major countries could enter economic recessions depending on the degree to which downside risk factors, such as a worsening of the economic slowdown in China, would materialize from next year.",
        "The member mentioned that, although the domestic economy was recovering at a moderate pace, supported by rapid improvement in private consumption, the recovery trend could weaken somewhat, due to the materialization of the impacts of a global economic slowdown from the second half of this year.",
        "The member saw that prices were showing high growth exceeding 6% and projected that demand-side inflationary pressures would continue for some time.",
        "The member also judged that, since high wage growth was continuing in the labor market, it would not be easy to rule out a possibility of additional inflationary pressures stemming from the interaction between wages and prices.",
        "The member stated that the soundness of the external sector was partially weakening, due to a significant rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate in the FX market, the narrowing of the current account surplus, and a sustained rise in the external debt ratio.",
        "The member judged that, although the sharp rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was largely attributable to the strong dollar in line with the US Federal Reserve’s strong tightening stance, and the domestic economy’s overall fundamentals such as official foreign reserves remained favorable, amplification of such instability could negatively affect domestic price and real economic trends.",
        "Finally, the member saw that there was some degree of credit risk aversion in the financial market, due to the widening of credit spreads for corporate bonds.",
        "The member noted that, although household lending growth was slowing, the household lending to income ratio still remained high.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that a continuation of the downward stabilization trend was needed.",
        "Taking into consideration these domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member saw a need to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",
        "The member judged that, although consumer prices and short-term inflation expectations were estimated to have fallen slightly, due to declines in international oil prices and in some commodity prices of late, inflationary pressures caused by demand-side factors were continuing, with the output gap remaining positive, and there were also upside risks to supply prices.",
        "However, the member noted that, given that Korea was a small and open economy, and that the effects of monetary policy would be seen after a time gap, a Base Rate policy that accounted solely for domestic factors could increase uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy.",
        "The member particularly expected that excessive Base Rate hikes would increase downside risks to the domestic economy at a time when the future growth outlook for the US economy remained unclear and the outlooks for the EU and Chinese economies were not optimistic.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to exercise caution about the degree of a Base Rate hike.",
        "Finally, the member noted that, from the perspective of the Balance of Payments, Korea generally saw sustained net inflows of foreign domestic bond investment funds during the past inversions of the US and Korean policy rates, but judged that if the inversion period were to last longer with the interest rate gap widening going forward, it would not be easy to rule out a possibility of some foreign capital outflows.",
        "Taking all these points into consideration, the member stated the following: first, the market was already expecting a 25 basis point tightening; second, considering domestic and overseas risk factors, tightening that exceeded market expectations could amplify economic uncertainties; third, a halt to the tightening stance could destabilize long-term inflation expectations, thus resulting in the entrenchment of high inflation; and fourth, keeping the Base Rate unchanged could result in capital outflows at a time when the US Federal Reserve was expected to hike its policy rate hike by 50 or 75 basis points in September.",
        "The member noted that it would be appropriate to adjust the pace of tightening going forward, depending on the evolution of domestic and overseas economic conditions in the future.",
        "One member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that, although exports and investment had exhibited slower growth and households’ real purchasing power had declined due to inflation, the domestic economy had exhibited relatively favorable growth in the first half of this year, led by consumption and the services sector.",
        "The member noted that, according to Statistic Korea’s household income and expenditure survey, households’ monthly average net income had increased by 6.0% year on year in the first quarter and by 6.9% in the second quarter, growing evenly across all decile income groups.",
        "The member mentioned that, looking at employment indicators, the number of persons employed, the labor force participation rate, the employment rate and the unemployment rate had remained favorable until July.",
        "The member meanwhile forecast consumer price inflation to remain high at around 6%.",
        "The member expected that global economic slowdown and inflation would start to have clear negative effects on the domestic economy in the second half of this year, and noted that the US and other major countries had been accelerating interest rate hikes amid the ongoing Ukraine crisis and zero-COVID policy in China.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation remained high although global inflationary pressures had been weakening somewhat.",
        "The member presented the view that, without fundamental changes in the current trend, the global economic growth rate for next year was likely to be below 3% and that the domestic economy would also slow due to its heavy dependence on external trade.",
        "The member evaluated that a global economic slowdown would significantly undermine the contribution of exports to growth and delay a recovery in facilities and construction investment.",
        "More specifically, the member stressed that the recent increase in manufacturing inventory had been attributable mainly to slowing demand and was highly likely to work to slow down manufacturing production and facilities investment going forward.",
        "The member stated that private consumption would continue to improve, led by face-to-face services, but its growth would be limited by weakening real purchasing power due to high inflation.",
        "The member added that improvement in consumption would be also weakened by the growing proportion of households whose consumption would be limited by the increasing DSR (ratio of monthly debt repayment to income) following interest rate hikes and also by ongoing adjustments in asset prices.",
        "The member took the view that, according to Statistic Korea’s household income and expenditure survey for the second quarter, the upper 20 percent of households in terms of income that belong to the fifth decile group had reduced their nominal consumption expenditure and their average propensity to consume had declined by as much as 8.7%p from a year earlier, indicating that people were preemptively preparing against an economic recession.",
        "The member mentioned that the Base Rate had been raised since August last year and the individual borrower-level DSR regulation had been strengthened, causing the long-lasting household debt growth to come to a halt and the economy to enter a deleveraging phase.",
        "The member added that, while the curbing of household lending had been the primary effect of interest rate hikes, the effect of slowing down domestic demand, such as consumption and investment, would become apparent with a time lag and inflationary pressures would ease gradually accordingly.",
        "The member however argued that, as housing prices and household debt relative to income were at already high levels in Korea, the pace of economic slowdown was highly likely to accelerate due to high interest rates during an economic downturn, and that, with this in mind, even if the Base Rate is raised further to cope with inflationary pressures, it would be necessary to carefully adjust the pace and degree of such rate hikes.",
        "One member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member commented that, looking at the changes in economic conditions of late, the trade-off between growth and inflation had grown, due to higher inflation and worsened economic conditions.",
        "The member stated that, while the price outlook presented by the Research Department appeared to take a neutral path overall, downside risks associated with the worsening of the economic slowdown and upside risks related to a resumption of the rise in international commodity prices both appeared to be high.",
        "The member raised concern that since wage growth that had been concentrated in some manufacturing industries with strong performances and service industries so far was spreading to broader industries, this could act as a channel of increased persistence of inflation.",
        "The member judged the downside risks to the growth path to predominate.",
        "The member saw that manufacturing shipment had fallen and inventory had increased, due to slower demand at home and abroad of late.",
        "The member projected that exports which had driven growth so far would be sluggish, due mainly to a slowdown in import demand in major countries, a contraction in the semiconductor cycle, and growth of overseas investment.",
        "The member added that private consumption would be constrained by growth in debt and income imbalances during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The member saw that the number of persons employed and the economic participation rate would increase, especially for the elderly and youth groups, but anticipated that the gap between growth and employment was likely to continue, due to a sustained slump in the quality of employment.",
        "The member judged that, although the trade-off between growth and inflation had expanded, given that the growth gap remained slightly positive and the inflation gap had widened sharply, it would be appropriate to place a focus on curbing prices in the conduct of monetary policy for some time.",
        "However, the member evaluated that, given that there were concerns about downside risks to growth and private debt repayment burdens of the vulnerable groups in particular had increased, it would be desirable to reduce the degree of Base Rate increase to 25 basis points this time.",
        "The member commented that the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates could widen, as major country central banks including the US Federal Reserve would sustain large policy rate hikes for some time, but it would be difficult to say that there were great concerns about capital outflows.",
        "The member projected that inflows of foreign bond investment would continue, given that foreign bond investment had seen net inflows during past periods when domestic and overseas interest rates were inverted, and the volume of long-term investment for the purpose of investment diversification and based on fundamentals had increased.",
        "The member commented that the price and growth trends and financial stability conditions would be considered together in a balanced manner in Base Rate rate operations going forward.",
        "However, the member judged that it would be appropriate to maintain a gradual Base Rate hike stance if the current path forecast continued to hold that even if price inflation reached a peak in the second half of this year, prices would fall at a slow pace, and economic growth would not deviate greatly from its potential.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to increase the degree of monetary tightening next year as well, while flexibly determining the size and pace of further Base Rate increases depending on changes in domestic and overseas economic trends going forward.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy continued to slow amid sustained uncertainties.",
        "As for the US, the member mentioned that, while employment had been favorable, it was highly uncertain when a full-fledged economic slowdown would begin and how the US Federal Reserve’s policy measures to tackle inflation would affect the extent of the economic downturn.",
        "Concerning Europe, the member noted that, although the services sector had been recovering, consumption of goods was sluggish and the economy was heavily exposed to shocks from rising energy prices.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that downside risks predominated on the growth side while upside risks carried more weight with respect to inflation, due to external factors such as geopolitical risks, the evolution of the Chinese economy, and major country monetary policies.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member stated that household income had been increasing and private consumption had been recovering rapidly, but heightened uncertainties could limit consumption growth.",
        "The member forecast that the contribution of exports would decrease substantially compared to last year.",
        "The member added that employment and production had been growing to exceed their potential levels, while growth momentum had been slowing gradually.",
        "The member presented the view that concerns about persistent inflation was the reason for supporting a Base Rate hike despite the reduction in global liquidity and a possibility of an economic downturn.",
        "First, the member noted that there existed latent risks of increases in agricultural product and energy prices as well as existing supply shocks from geopolitical risks.",
        "The member added that the US Federal Reserve’s continued rapid monetary tightening could keep the US dollar strong and give rise to additional inflationary pressures through the exchange rate channel.",
        "The member also argued that, in the current high inflation environment, changes in economic behavior could affect the persistence of inflation.",
        "The member took the view that, if the current high inflation environment continues with inflation having exceeded its medium-term target (2%) for more than two years by the first quarter of next year, economic agents would have a stronger tendency to aggressively collect price information and reflect it in their decision-making, and as a result, interactions between inflation expectations and inflation could strengthen inflation momentum.",
        "The member also stressed the need to consider demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "The member noted that, looking at the previous periods of high inflation in 1998 and reaching its peak, and this had been attributable to a sharp fall in the output gap due to demand shocks.",
        "The member added that this time, however, since the economy was sustaining growth at its potential level, demand-side inflationary pressures were highly likely to continue unless there were additional large external shocks.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that demand-side inflationary pressures were acting as upward pressure on core inflation and that attention should be paid to the clearer positive correlation between the output gap and core inflation since the pandemic.",
        "The member assessed that the recent slight fall in short-term inflation expectations and anchoring of long-term inflation expectations were positive developments.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that it was a bit too early to stop worrying about inflation momentum, as CPI components that had risen to a greater extent than July’s consumer price inflation of 6.3% accounted for 43% of total items, underlying inflation remained on the rise, and the PPI had also continued to increase month on month for the seventh consecutive month.",
        "The member emphasized the need to maintain the current rate hike stance for the time being, considering that the central bank’s policy responses could affect demand-side inflationary pressures and inflation expectations.",
        "The member noted that the less inflation expectations were anchored, the more impacts supply shocks would have on the real economy and the weaker the monetary policy transmission channels would become, requiring even greater Base Rate hikes later on.",
        "The member added that it would be more appropriate to operate monetary policy with a focus on ensuring price stability, if a certain degree of slower growth was tolerable, and that this would contribute to stabilizing the economy over a medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "The member argued that it would be necessary to sustain the current policy stance for the time being while monitoring how a global economic downturn would affect the domestic economy.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member judged that the global economy had exhibited slower growth and inflationary pressures seemed to be weakening somewhat, in line with the recent fall in oil and grain prices and the easing of pressures from supply disruptions, but the situations and shocks individual countries were faced with varied substantially.",
        "The member noted that in the euro area a delay in the natural gas supply would continue to act as upward pressure on inflation, and in China a slump in the real estate market and risks related to COVID-19 restrictions had been weighing on economic recovery.",
        "The member also mentioned that US consumption, corporate earnings and employment remained favorable and there were ongoing upward pressures on inflation, and those from the services charges in particular.",
        "The member argued that, despite the slowing economy, inflationary pressures continued overall and uncertainties remained high.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member stated that, despite the worsening external economic conditions and the contracting sentiment of the general public, overall economic activity indicators had been favorable, and expected the output gap to remain positive this year and the next.",
        "The member noted that private consumption had remained strong, boosted by improvement in services sector consumption, and forecast that private consumption was unlikely to shrink rapidly in the second half as well, supported by employment growth and wage increases.",
        "As to investment, the member mentioned that the sluggishness in construction investment had been easing while facilities investment had improved at a somewhat slower pace.",
        "The member noted that export growth had been slowing due to the base-period effect from last year’s strong performance and a slowdown in demand from China.",
        "The member expressed the view that the economy was likely to slow gradually, given domestic and external economic conditions, ongoing interest rate hikes, households’ transfer income that would decrease from the first half, consumption, and worsening corporate sentiment.",
        "The member stated that, despite the six previous Base Rate hikes, financial market conditions had been stable overall.",
        "The member added that government bond yields had declined due to concerns about a global economic slowdown, and foreign stock investors, after their net sales so far, had shifted to a net buying position since July.",
        "The member noted that bank lending to households had continued to slow, while bank lending to the corporate sector remained on a sharp rise.",
        "The member stated that, unless global oil prices resurged, inflation was likely to ease gradually due to a base effect.",
        "The member added that inflation pressures seemed to remain high, however, considering how the future price path would be affected by the sustained demand-side inflation pressures, a rise in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, demand for higher wages and corporations passing on production costs to consumers.",
        "The member stressed that attention should be paid to the possibility of inflation remaining high substantially above its target level for a considerable period of time, given that inflation expectations had increased significantly this year, core CPI items had made a gradually increasing contribution to inflation, and inflation had been spreading to a wide range of areas, particularly personal services charges.",
        "The member presented the view that, taking into overall consideration the domestic and overseas economic conditions mentioned above, the priority of monetary policy for now should be placed on easing the persistence of high inflation and the current rate hike stance should be maintained so far as it does not undermine financial market stability.",
        "The member added that, in order to make high inflation less persistent, it would be necessary to raise the Base Rate to the upper limit of the neutral interest rate or a level slightly above the limit.",
        "The member evaluated that, at a time when this year’s growth rate was forecast to exceed its potential level and the output gap to remain positive this year and next, placing the monetary policy focus on stabilizing inflation at an early stage, even if somewhat weighing on aggregate demand growth, would help the domestic economy sustain stable growth in the medium- to long-term and minimize social welfare losses.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to 2.50%.",
        "The Board judges that the policy response to prevent the entrenchment of high inflation should be continued as inflationary pressures and inflation expectations have remained high, although economic downside risks have increased at home and abroad.",
        "□ Currently available information suggests that global economic downside risks have increased, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis and significant policy rate hikes in major advanced countries, while inflation has remained high.",
        "In global financial markets, major price variables have fluctuated significantly due to changes in expectations for the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, economic indicators and monetary policy changes in major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "□ Downside risks to the Korean economy have increased with the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in major countries, while private consumption has continued to recover.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, GDP growth is projected to be 2.6% in 2022 and export growth has slowed.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation has remained high in the 6% range due to the accelerating price increases in agricultural and personal services, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have somewhat moderated.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high in the upper-3% range and the 4% range, respectively.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation could decline due to the decrease in global oil prices but will remain high in the 5-6% range for a considerable time as core inflation continues to rise.",
        "Consumer price inflation is projected to be 5.2% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023, substantially above the May forecast of 4.5% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023.",
        "□ Volatility in domestic financial markets has increased, influenced by global financial market movements.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have rebounded after a considerable decline, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly due to US dollar strengthening.",
        "Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have shifted to a decrease.",
        "□ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, despite the increase in economic downside risks and underlying high uncertainties surrounding domestic and external conditions.",
        "In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, financial stability conditions such as capital flows, monetary policy changes in major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (July 2022),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that, despite a recovery in private consumption, driven by face-to-face service consumption and ongoing favorable labor conditions, domestic economic growth was slowing due mainly to sluggish investment as well as slowing export growth stemming from a weakening of economic growth in major countries.",
        "Some of the members expected growth to remain higher than its potential level, despite external uncertainties surrounding the future growth path.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased significantly and inflation as having been accelerating, with consumer price inflation reaching 6.0% in June, due to stronger demand-side pressure, as well as sustained pressure on the supply side, including a rise in commodity and food prices.",
        "Some of the members stressed the urgent need to reduce inflationary pressure and stabilize inflation expectations, even if this would mean a loss of growth compared to the current level, in consideration of the interaction between inflation and wages, the lag of cost increases to consumers through prices, and the lag of monetary policy, although there were uncertainties surrounding the future path.",
        "In addition, members assessed that it would be necessary to be ready for increased volatility in the foreign exchange market in line with worsened global financial conditions, as risk aversion was strengthening due mainly to monetary policy normalization in major countries and to concerns about a global economic slowdown.",
        "Some of the members presented the view that it would be necessary to prevent a sharp widening of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates through a Base Rate hike.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to the possibility of risks, such as heavier debt-servicing burdens and housing price declines in times of interest rate hikes, and of interest rate hike shocks in vulnerable sectors, spilling over into the larger financial system.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that global inflation had been accelerating since the second half of last year due to the combined effect of supply shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, and due to the demand recovery that was based on the significantly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies since the pandemic.",
        "The member noted that, in response to this, major countries had been rapidly adjusting such accommodative monetary policies and that the adjustments so far and expectations of further adjustments had been bringing down asset prices and reducing global liquidity.",
        "The member also assessed that these adjustments had also been noted in consumer and investor sentiment, leading to a slowdown in the momentum of economic recovery.",
        "The member noted that inflation concerns were growing even further in Korea as well, with inflation expectations surging to 3.9% from 3.3% a month before, and CPI inflation for June reaching 6%, and went on to state that supply-side and demand-side factors driving inflation each accounted for roughly 50% of the inflation.",
        "The member mentioned that private consumption in Korea had been showing a rapid recovery led by consumption of face-to-face services, while exports had slowed significantly due to slowing overseas demand and supply disruptions.",
        "The member noted that the average capacity utilization ratio and PMI of the manufacturing sector had declined and the sluggishness of facilities investment had eased somewhat affected by improved supply disruptions, while construction investment had remained sluggish owing to rising material prices, strikes, and worsening weather conditions.",
        "The member assessed that the employment situation was favorable overall, with the number of persons employed continuing to rise and the unemployment rate remaining low.",
        "The member assessed that financial market volatility had increased as major price variables had reflected expectations of tighter financial conditions in line with rapid policy rate hikes in major countries.",
        "The member mentioned that household lending had exhibited slower growth owing to lending regulations and rising lending rates, while corporate lending had continued to grow significantly.",
        "The member presented the view that, in terms of liquidity, M2 growth remained high compared with the 10-year average before the pandemic and, although the corporate bond market had somewhat contracted recently, overall funding conditions in the corporate sector seemed favorable.",
        "The member evaluated that the priority of monetary policy in the current economic situation should be reducing inflationary pressure and stabilizing inflation expectations and that the current Base Rate remained accommodative, below the estimated range for the neutral interest rate.",
        "The member argued that the economic growth rate for this year and next was expected to be adjusted downward somewhat but would not deviate far from the potential growth path and that, unless inflation expectations are addressed actively, the Korean economy could pay a higher price in the long run.",
        "The member assessed that, although the current high inflation was attributable largely to supply-side factors, the central bank should take aggressive monetary policy measures to cope with it even if they weigh on economic recovery, since there were only limited options to resolve supply-side inflationary pressure.",
        "The member went on to state that, since steep rate hikes by the U.S. were expected, it would be necessary to ease growing pressure on the FX sector in line with the widening U.S.-Korea interest rate differential.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to further adjust the Base Rate while continuing to closely analyze the inflation trend, changes in the conditions for economic growth, and financial market conditions, and while monitoring monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "Another member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that the domestic economy was maintaining growth exceeding its potential.",
        "The member stated that, while export growth was slowing moderately and facilities investment was continuing to undergo adjustments, private consumption, led by service sectors, was showing sound growth, and the member forecast that the domestic economy would maintain steady growth momentum, boosted by the effects of supplementary budgets.",
        "The member noted that labor market conditions were showing favorable movements with the number of persons employed maintaining its substantial uptrend and wages showing a solid upward trend.",
        "However, the member saw that there were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path associated with the Ukraine crisis, the policy stances of major country central banks, and the spread of COVID-19.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to these points.",
        "The member noted that prices had risen rapidly and consumer price inflation had climbed to the 6% level in June, but upside risks still appeared to be large.",
        "The member commented that, as the steep uptrend in prices had continued since the middle of last year and had gathered pace of late, inflation expectations were rising rapidly and there was a growing possibility of this leading to an interaction between inflation and wages going forward.",
        "The member stressed the need to keep a close watch on the possibility that a high inflation phase could take root in the domestic and global economy if such destabilizing factors at home and abroad persisted.",
        "Looking at the financial situation, the member stated that financial conditions were continuing to show a reduction in the degree of accommodation, with market interest rates rising substantially and stock prices falling considerably.",
        "However, the member added that it would be necessary to consider the point that real interest rates were actually falling, given the recent steep rise in inflation expectations.",
        "The member noted that financial conditions did not appear to be greatly constrained given that M2 growth remained high at the 8% level.",
        "Meanwhile, the member commented that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen, working as additional upward pressure on prices.",
        "On the financial stability side, the member assessed that the widening of imbalances in the financial sector at home were being curbed, as growth in domestic household lending was slowing and housing prices were falling slightly.",
        "However, the member took the view that the external sector could become less resilient as large-scale overseas investment by, for instance, institutional investors, was continuing, while the current account surplus had been narrowing of late.",
        "Taking all these into consideration, the member stated that there were growing risks that macroeconomic stability and external sector balances could be shaken going forward, due to higher inflation of late, and that it would be necessary to continue policy measures in response with a focus placed on price stability for some time.",
        "The member especially stressed the need to prevent growth momentum of inflation itself from setting in by raising the Base Rate as rapidly as possible to the neutral level, as prices had risen steeply of late and inflation expectations were also rising rapidly.",
        "The member saw that a large rate hike would have some negative impacts on the current growth trend, but that this was unavoidable to secure stability in the medium- to long-term macroeconomy, and that the rate hike would help enhance the domestic financial market’s ability to absorb shocks from increased volatility in international financial markets and would ease pressure for an increase in imbalances in the foreign exchange sector.",
        "In the meantime, the member presented the view that the ensuing difficulties faced by vulnerable sectors should be addressed with appropriate microeconomic policy measures through concerted policy efforts.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated the need to decide on the timing and the degree of further Base Rate adjustments by closely monitoring the development of external uncertainties and any resulting changes in the paces of growth and inflation at home.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member saw that a main reason for the current Base Rate hike was inflation and stated that consumer price inflation in June (year-on-year) was 6.0%, the highest since November 1998 when consumer price inflation stood at 6.8%.",
        "The member explained that inflation was largely triggered by overseas factors, including supply chain issues, China’s lockdown measures, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis, but that inflationary pressure on the demand side had been gradually increasing of late with half of the current inflation being caused by demand-side factors, and the diffusion index for core items maintaining growth.",
        "In addition, the member noted that one-year-ahead inflation expectations among the general public stood at 3.9% as of June.",
        "The member mentioned that there were also some positive aspects, such as somewhat slower month-on-month price inflation growth and the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations among experts at 2.0%.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that a Base Rate hike was unavoidable in overall consideration of the level and trend of inflation, growing demand-side factors, and a rise in short-term inflation expectations.",
        "The member saw that what was worrisome in deciding on a 0.5%p Base Rate hike was an unintended sudden economic downturn following the rate hike.",
        "However, the member judged that inflation urgently needed to be dealt with first to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched and that the real economy could withstand the rate hike at the current level.",
        "The member saw that the real economy could not deviate greatly from the potential GDP path, although consideration should also be given to the quality of employment, demographic changes, and the possibility of structural change during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The member noted that the low unemployment rate and the very high job vacancy rate meant that even if there would be a slight downturn in the economy, if the job vacancy rate signifying labor demand were to decline first, losses on the employment side would be relatively small.",
        "The need to prepare against factors causing disturbances in the FX market in line with foreign portfolio investment net outflows was partially considered in this month’s decision.",
        "The member particularly emphasized that the volume of capital outflows could increase in a short period of time if the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were larger than expected and if international financial markets became unstable at a time when the expected return on won-denominated financial assets had fallen due to the widening gap between domestic and overseas interest rates.",
        "The member went on to stress the need to prevent the interest rate gap from widening to a worrisome extent.",
        "The member expressed the view that the factors mentioned above had been taken into consideration in determining the degree of a Base Rate hike for this month, but that the rate hike should be accompanied by monitoring of vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member first noted that a Base Rate hike would add to the debt-servicing burden of economic agents.",
        "The member added that, during a period of rate hikes, a concerning situation could arise with respect to vulnerable household borrowers, young people with excessive debt, small business owners with deficits or who suffer from liquidity shortages, and insolvent firms, and that the proportion of households whose consumption would be limited by rising interest rates could grow rapidly.",
        "The member presented the opinion that it would be necessary to closely monitor these vulnerable groups and also to preemptively examine measures to deal with household loans that might turn sour, businesses and financial institution liquidity problems, and the resolution of non-performing loans.",
        "The member also mentioned the need to prepare against a possible drop in housing prices to a greater extent than expected.",
        "The member added that there were views that such a risk was relatively low in Korea, where household loans were concentrated mostly among high-income and high-credit borrowers, but according to the Survey of Household Finances and Living Conditions, real estate accounted for more than 70% of assets across all income quintiles and the share of their financial liabilities was much lower than that in advanced countries.",
        "The member presented the view that this indicated that a very small proportion of liquid assets, regardless of income level, would serve as a buffer against shocks such as a housing price decline.",
        "The member also noted that it would be necessary to prepare against the possibility of shocks to vulnerable groups developing into systemic risks in order to fulfill the central bank’s mandate of ensuring financial stability, and that it would also be necessary to pay attention to overseas factors.",
        "The member stated that, at a time when U.S. dollar supply and demand conditions had been worsening for some time, it would be important to closely monitor global risk factors and changes in indicators of external soundness in order to maintain Korea’s international credit standing.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that, looking at recent economic conditions, growth in major countries had weakened, the pace of global trade growth had slowed, and in financial markets, the U.S. dollar had strengthened further and volatility in interest rates and stock prices had increased.",
        "Accordingly, the member commented that Korea’s export growth had slowed, but the extent of the slowdown appeared to be limited thanks to structural demand expansion in the IT sector, and to private consumption, particularly face-to-face services, which were continuing to recover.",
        "The member judged that, although downside risks to growth were high due to worsened export and investment conditions and to the resurgence of COVID-19, the economy would be able to maintain growth at a level higher than its potential, as long as there were no large deteriorations in domestic or overseas conditions.",
        "With regard to prices, the member noted that, amid ongoing pressure on the demand side, pressure on the supply side, including oil prices, exchange rates and wages, had increased further, and, as a result, consumer price inflation stood at 6.0% in June, the highest level since 1998.",
        "The member forecast that, while prices would rise somewhat slowly as a slowdown in global demand would lead to oil and grain price declines, high prices would continue for a considerable time.",
        "The member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by an unprecedentedly sharp 50 basis points at this meeting in consideration of recent economic and financial conditions and suggested a few reasons for this judgment.",
        "First, the member judged that the pace of price rises and the range of inflation diffusion were far exceeding expectations and the upside risks appeared to be greater, considering prolonged geopolitical risks, the resurgence of COVID-19, and supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of worsened weather conditions.",
        "The member stressed the importance at this juncture of preventing a vicious cycle of interaction between inflation expectations and actual prices, as wage growth was expanding with inflation expectations rising rapidly.",
        "The member saw the need to speed up Base Rate hikes given that interest rate policy would be transmitted to prices after a time lag of several quarters.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, according to an analysis by the Bank of Korea Research Department, growth for this year and the next was unlikely to be lower than the 2% level, and thus it would be necessary to place a priority on price stability for some time.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to recall historical experiences, that a further surge in inflation would inevitably lead to a larger rate hike and to a loss of growth in the future.",
        "The member also considered the need to actively respond to the possibility of capital outflows, as global liquidity was declining and tendencies toward risk aversion were growing due to financial tightening and concerns about an economic slowdown in major countries.",
        "The member noted that, while a reversal to a net outflow had been seen concerning foreign exchange supply and demand conditions, the short-term external debt ratio had increased and foreign portfolio investment continued to show a net outflow since the beginning of this year, and thus related concerns were growing.",
        "The member took the view that, while sound fundamentals, such as macroeconomic stability, were important to ensure soundness in the foreign exchange sector, it would also be necessary to prevent a rapid inversion of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates, during a period of soaring global interest rates, as seen recently.",
        "The member saw that a Base Rate hike would help deal with financial imbalances by ensuring stability in household debt and curbing corporate lending.",
        "The member judged that the entire financial system would be able to withstand a large rate hike, considering that private debt growth so far had been led by high-income and high-credit borrowers.",
        "The member noted, however, that default risks in vulnerable sectors, including vulnerable households and corporate borrowers, heavily indebted youth, and self-employed business owners lacking liquidity, could all be much greater, and thus it would be necessary to seek separate supplementary measures to alleviate their principal and interest repayment burdens.",
        "Taking into consideration the economic and price outlooks and financial conditions, the member saw a need to maintain the Base Rate hike stance for some time.",
        "However, the member judged that it would be desirable to maintain a gradual pace of Base Rate hikes, considering economic uncertainties at home and abroad, and the time lag of monetary policy, unless price inflation ran well above the expected trajectory.",
        "Another member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 2.25% from the current 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that the global economic recovery had been weakening significantly due to slowing trade growth and ongoing high inflation.",
        "The member noted that global prices remained on the rise in most countries, centering on energy and food prices, and upward pressure was spreading widely.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member judged that consumption and the services industry were leading the economic recovery, while export growth was slowing and investment was sluggish.",
        "The member stated that the growth rate for this year would be somewhat below the Research Department’s May forecast (2.7%) and that Base Rate hikes would act as an additional downside risk.",
        "The member presented the view that the annual inflation rate would substantially exceed the previous forecast (4.5%), and that the future direction of the price path would depend mostly on overseas factors, such as developments in the Ukraine crisis, fluctuations in international commodity prices, and changes in global aggregate demand.",
        "The member assessed that, despite slowing growth, inflationary pressure made it difficult for the central bank to make monetary policy responses.",
        "The member judged that, considering the fact that cost increases are passed on to prices with a time lag, inflationary pressure would continue for the time being.",
        "The member, meanwhile, mentioned that last year’s 4.1% growth, boosted by strong exports, had led to significant increases in household income and employment this year, and that pressure on consumption demand had accordingly increased substantially.",
        "The member noted that the number of persons employed, the economic activity participation rate, the employment rate, and the job openings-to-seeker ratio had all risen, that the unemployment rate gap had remained negative for several months, and that total time in employment had increased by more than 4% from that during the pre-pandemic period, despite a gradual decline in working hours per person.",
        "The member evaluated that the increase in earned income and excess savings during the pandemic would support consumption to some extent, and that, since consumption was at a low level given employment and household income, household consumption could expand further despite the decrease in real purchasing power due to inflation.",
        "The member also forecast that, despite sluggish investment and slowing exports, aggregate consumption would lead economic growth this year, just as government consumption maintained last year’s strong growth.",
        "The member mentioned that, considering such inflation and employment conditions, there were good reasons to maintain the rate hike stance and that the Base Rate would be continuously adjusted for some time, consistent with real economic activity and the inflation outlook.",
        "The member however expressed the view that, since uncertainties over the mid- to long-term neutral interest rate level had increased due to global inflation shocks and prolonged supply disruptions, it would be necessary to respond while carefully examining how prices and the economy respond to interest rate hikes and how financial variables fluctuate.",
        "The member meanwhile expected that international financial markets would remain highly volatile for the time being, as in the domestic FX sector price variable volatility had increased, some external soundness indicators had worsened in the domestic FX sector, the risk of global economic recession has been growing, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has been accelerating rate hikes since the previous MPB meeting.",
        "The member stressed that, although vulnerabilities had not yet been exposed, careful examination was needed as to how worsening global financial conditions affect the stability of the domestic FX sector.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.25%.",
        "The Board judges that a pre-emptive policy response to prevent the entrenchment of high inflation is of greater importance for some time as high inflation is continuing and becoming broad-based while short-term inflation expectations are rising sharply, although economic downside risks have increased at home and abroad.",
        "`□` Currently available information suggests that global economic growth has weakened, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis, while inflation has remained high.",
        "In global financial markets, risk aversion has strengthened due to the acceleration of policy rate hikes in major countries and consequent concerns about economic slowdown.",
        "The US dollar has remained strong and stock prices have fallen considerably, while government bond yields in major countries have fluctuated significantly.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries.",
        "`□` The Korean economy has continued to recover.",
        "Private consumption has sustained its improvement and sluggishness in facilities investment has eased, while export growth has somewhat slowed.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, while private consumption is likely to sustain its recovery, GDP growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the May forecast of 2.7%, affected by the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in major countries.",
        "Uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to be elevated.",
        "`□` Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to 6.0% due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products and the accelerating price increases in other expenditure categories.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to close to 4%.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high at above year overall.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to remain elevated at 4% or higher for a considerable time.",
        "`□` In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen considerably, due to expectations about policy rate hikes at home and abroad, while stock prices have fallen sharply driven mainly by concerns about global economic slowdown.",
        "The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, reflecting the global strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "Household loans have increased slightly and housing prices have remained steady.",
        "`□` Considering inflation and economic conditions, though economic downside risk is indeed high, uncertainties remain elevated, and thus the Board sees it as important at this time to curb the spread of inflation expectations through a 50-basis-point rate hike to prevent acceleration of inflation.",
        "`□` The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to run above the target level for a considerable time.",
        "In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increase of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the trends of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, and external economic conditions including geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (May 2022),[2)] _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, despite slower export growth following lockdown measures in China and sluggish facilities and construction investment, the domestic economy continued to recover, led by a rebound in private consumption boosted by the lifting of social distancing measures.",
        "Some members anticipated that, despite external uncertainties on the forecast growth path, the domestic economy would maintain steady growth momentum, supported by accumulated household savings and continued improvement in employment.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed upside risks to inflation as having increased significantly, led by sustained inflationary pressure on the supply side, including a rise in commodity and food prices since the Ukraine crisis and production setbacks due to lockdown measures in China, combined with demand-side factors such as consumption demand growth.",
        "Some members noted that individual perceptions of prices and inflation expectations had also increased, in line with a substantial number of items in the CPI basket rising significantly and processed food and dining-out prices growing.",
        "They also expressed the view that consumer price inflation would run at the mid-4% level for the year overall, substantially above the February forecast and, in this regard, attention should be paid to a secondary effect that could lead to wage increases.",
        "Meanwhile, members assessed that financial market volatility had been expanding as risk aversion had strengthened and asset prices had fallen due to monetary policy changes in major countries and slowing economic growth.",
        "Some members mentioned that financial conditions had become tighter but still remained accommodative due to a high level of household debt and continued growth in business credit.",
        "Some other members also presented the view that it would be necessary to respond to the risk of financial imbalances, taking into account heavier debt-servicing burdens and rising funding costs in times of interest rate hikes.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to pay close attention to how the domestic economy would be affected by increasing FX and global financial market volatility, capital flows following changes in the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates, and China’s economic countermeasures.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.75% from the current 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.75% from the current 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the uptrend in domestic prices had strengthened, growth had weakened somewhat and external condition uncertainties had increased even further since the April meeting.",
        "The member stated that the GDP growth forecast for this year had been adjusted downward to 2.7% from 3.0% and consumer price inflation was expected to remain at around 5% for the next several months to run at approximately 4.5% for the year overall, well above the previous forecast of 3.1%.",
        "The member mentioned that, as exports, a key driver for the recovery of growth of the Korean economy, had been slowing due to lockdowns of major cities in China and slowing growth in major countries, the contribution of net exports to growth was likely to decline somewhat.",
        "The member on the other hand noted that face-to-face services consumption, having been sluggish so far, had been improving rapidly since April in line with a return to normal life and that private consumption would remain strong, boosted by accumulated household savings, favorable employment conditions and government transfer payments.",
        "Regarding the financial markets, the member mentioned that, although household debt growth had slowed, credit to the corporate sector had maintained strong growth and liquidity growth remained at a high level.",
        "The member went on to state that financial conditions had become somewhat tighter due to the four Base Rate hikes since August last year and acceleration of policy rate hikes in major countries but, given the uptrend in prices and the recovery of economic growth, they still seemed to remain accommodative.",
        "The member expressed the view that what called for the most attention in the recent trend of economic conditions included persistent inflationary pressures and heightened uncertainties following the acceleration of monetary tightening in major countries.",
        "The member mentioned that inflationary pressures had been increasing, with import prices and producer prices remaining on a sharp rise and consumption demand recovering after having stagnated.",
        "The member pointed to a sharp increase in the proportion of CPI items that had exhibited year-on-year growth of 4% or more, leading to stronger inflation expectations among the general public.",
        "The member stressed that upward pressures on commodity and food prices following the Ukraine crisis, as well as supply constraints and cost burdens due to China’s lockdown measures, would last longer and to a greater extent than previously expected and that caution was required with regard to the possibility of a secondary effect being triggered by corporations’ passing-on costs to consumers, rising inflation expectations and demand for higher wages.",
        "The member projected meanwhile that a majority of major countries had been adjusting their monetary easing stances to tackle inflation and, in this process, financial conditions in Korea would continue to be affected by increasing global financial market volatility.",
        "The member mentioned that the domestic financial markets had become even more vulnerable to internal or external economic shocks owing to the accumulation of debt held by households, small businesses and SMEs.",
        "The member presented the view that rising interest rates and increasing financial market volatility at home and abroad had been dampening the uptrend in asset prices that had been seen throughout the globe, pulling down prices of stocks and crypto assets in particular, and adding to debt repayment burdens of vulnerable groups, and went on to state that it should be carefully monitored how all of this would affect financial stability.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to pay attention to pressures on the FX sector placed by the outlook for the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates and expectations of the exchange rate in line with the steep rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.75% from the current 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that it would be necessary to take preemptive monetary policy measures in a situation where inflation was forecast to remain high in the 5% range for some time, the price path was expected to remain substantially above the inflation target next year, and major countries were likely to raise interest rates at fast paces.",
        "The member also pointed to the need to closely analyze inflation, growth, monetary policy changes in major countries, and financial and FX market developments and make further adjustments to the Base Rate so that it could become close to the neutral interest rate.",
        "Another member judged that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.75% from the current 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that, despite the contraction in facilities and construction investment, the Korean economy had recently sustained a modest recovery overall, supported by a rebound in private consumption under the improved pandemic conditions, sustained favorable exports, and the expansionary fiscal stance as seen in the supplementary budget.",
        "The member however forecast the growth rate for this year to fall somewhat short of the Research Department’s February forecast (3%), affected by global supply constraints and the economic slowdown.",
        "The member projected that consumer price inflation would significantly exceed the February forecast and run close to the mid-4% level for the year, and that core inflation(excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) was likely to exceed 3% this year.",
        "The member assessed that, as employment had improved along with the recovery of the face-to-face services industry, the number of persons employed had increased by around 850,000 year on year in March and April and the employment and unemployment rates had continued to show solid improvement.",
        "The member meanwhile mentioned that, according to Statistics Korea’s household income and expenditure survey, the monthly average income per household had risen by 10.1% year on year in the first quarter of this year and wage income by 10.2%, and income by quintile groups had also grown evenly.",
        "The member evaluated that, since a rise in production activities driven by exports and the manufacturing industry was seen to have led to a recovery in employment and household income and the uptrend in prices had been spreading due to the pressures on inflation from the consumption demand side following the lifting of social distancing restrictions, there was good reason for maintaining the rate hike stance.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that in this regard it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to respond to heightened inflation pressures.",
        "The member however noted that, while maintaining the rate hike stance, it would be necessary to respond flexibly to future economic conditions, in consideration of the nature of shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.",
        "Most of all, the member stressed that the COVID-19 pandemic had been an asymmetrical shock that had hit the services sector and consumption harder than the manufacturing sector and exports, and had affected economic agents’ activities and welfare unevenly for the past two years, and in this regard, careful attention should be paid not only to aggregate indicators such as the GDP growth rate but also to whether sectors exhibiting much slower growth than in the past had returned to a recovery track.",
        "The member also presented the view that, since inflation had been attributable substantially to supply-side factors, it would be necessary to adjust the degree of monetary policy responses and that, with regard to consumer price inflation growth, it would be also ideal to respond differently to changes in non-core inflation and even to core inflation changes caused by supply constraints.",
        "The member mentioned that, since all lending to households and corporations in Korea was linked closely to short-term interest rates, a rapid increase in debt-servicing burdens and funding costs could limit the real economic recovery.",
        "More specifically, the member emphasized that, since corporate lending rates were linked closely to the Base Rate, attention should be paid to the possibility of a steep rise in the Base Rate causing credit risks to increase and investment to contract.",
        "Concerning soaring household debt, the member argued that it would be advisable to ensure that borrower-specific DSR regulations are in place, rather than taking monetary policy responses, to keep household debt under control over a medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "The member stressed that, although inflation would remain high for some time, global aggregate demand had started to exhibit slower growth, and in this regard, it would be necessary to carefully adjust the pace of Base Rate hikes to minimize growth loss.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member mentioned that the recovery in the global economy had slowed somewhat and there were high uncertainties, both upside and downside, in line with geopolitical risks, monetary policies in major countries and the development of China’s COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "The member took the view that the Korean economy had sustained its recovery despite heightened uncertainties at home and abroad, while export growth had moderated somewhat, affected by China’s lockdown measures, and was expected to slow from the second quarter on, combined with a decline in global goods demand.",
        "In terms of facilities and construction investment, the member evaluated that its contribution to the GDP growth rate had decreased, owing chiefly to supply constraints, but was likely to increase again once the supply issue is resolved.",
        "The member mentioned that, just as in the previous meeting, it was inflation that was the center of attention at this meeting, and evaluated that upward pressure on inflation had increased significantly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March this year and China’s lockdown measures to contain the pandemic, and uncertainty concerning the duration of high inflation had also increased accordingly.",
        "The member noted that energy, commodity and grain prices had soared globally and China’ lockdown measures had led to production setbacks and a delay in logistics in the major manufacturing industries, and that the effects of these factors, combined with Korean industries’ heavy dependence on external trade, had been spreading to many industries and increasing costs.",
        "The member stated that the share of the CPI items showing 5% or higher year-on-year growth had exceeded 40% and the share of the items showing 10% or higher growth had been nearly 20% this year, and went on to forecast that, with this taken into consideration, consumer price inflation for this year would be in the mid-4% range, far above the February forecast of 3.1%.",
        "As to inflation expectations, the member took the view that long-term inflation expectations could be seen as anchored at their target level, given that five-year-ahead inflation expectations among the expert group had been fluctuating at around 2% whereas one-year-ahead inflation expectations had been on the rise, while inflation expectations of the general public, both short- and long-term, had risen.",
        "The member noted that uncertainties surrounding the inflation path were still high and the possibility of agflation in particular was worrisome from various angles.",
        "The member stated first that even if the war in Ukraine ended peacefully soon, global grain prices could remain high for a considerable time due to the characteristics of agricultural products, and this would likely affect processed food and dining-out prices in Korea, which was heavily dependent on imported grain.",
        "The member went on to argue that since the two items had strong downward rigidity and played a role in perceived prices, they were seen to be closely related to inflation expectations.",
        "The member stressed that, in addition to these supply-side factors, a sudden increase in service consumption after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions could act as a demand-side factor, and this could result in elevated inflationary pressures on both the supply and demand sides.",
        "The member also presented the view that, although the uptrend of food and dining-out prices was not directly in the realm of monetary policy, it could place a relatively heavy economic burden on the low-income group which spends heavily on both items, and thus it could cause an issue from the perspective of distribution.",
        "The member noted that, given these points, monetary policy should be used appropriately to control inflation caused by demand factors and inflation expectations, and the monetary policy authorities should place a focus on inflation in the conduct of monetary policy, to the extent that recovery in the real economy was not markedly harmed.",
        "The member saw the need to pay particular attention to domestic and international financial stability in the future, in addition to inflation.",
        "The member first noted that, as for the domestic financial market, volatility in price variables had heightened, but there had not been any very noticeable difficulties in corporate financing conditions in consideration of the size of uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "However, the member stated that, particularly since risk aversion was strengthening in the international financial market and there were signs of what was deemed to be preference for safe haven assets or high-quality liquid assets among economic agents in the domestic financial market, capital could be over-concentrated in certain sectors or instruments and thus weaken the financial intermediary function.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to closely monitor the relevant indicators.",
        "In addition, the member added that it would be necessary to prepare for the impacts on our economy of counter-cyclical measures in China, which is closely linked with our country in terms of finance and the real economy.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member judged that the growth momentum of the domestic economy had held steady of late.",
        "The member noted that, although the trend of growth in exports had slowed somewhat and facilities investment was going through a correction, private consumption was recovering rapidly, bolstered by normalization of economic activity following the lifting of social distancing measures, and employment conditions were also showing a trend of steady improvement.",
        "The member projected that, while there were a lot of uncertainties surrounding the growth path and economic growth was expected to fall below the February forecast, the domestic economy would maintain growth at the upper-2% level.",
        "The member expected consumption to maintain rapid improvement, bolstered by the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, given the consumption capacity built up so far and the government’s support through supplementary budgets.",
        "The member forecast that exports would maintain strong growth, driven by the IT sector, and investment would show a trend of recovery in the second half of this year, thanks to the effects of the deferred gradual easing of supply chain constraints.",
        "The member added that even if downside risks associated with the Ukraine crisis, slower growth in China and policy rate hikes in major economies materialized, growth would be unlikely to run below the potential level, at least in the short term.",
        "The member stated that prices continued to show a stronger-than-expected upward trend.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, although the Research Department had revised the price outlook sharply upward to the mid-4% level for this year and the upper-2% level for next year, upside risks still would appear to predominate in consideration of the rapid improvement in consumption conditions of late, and the prospect of the continuation of factors causing rises in international prices of commodities or grain.",
        "The member saw that the recent uptrend in domestic prices were conspicuously seen to be a mid- to long-term inflation phenomenon rather than a transitory fluctuation, and argued that if the steep uptrend continued and a second round of its spillover effects spread, the firm anchoring of long-term inflation expectations could be easily shaken.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to pay attention to this point.",
        "Looking at the financial situation, the member stated that financial conditions were continuing to show a reduction in the degree of accommodation, with short-term market interest rates rising substantially on expectations for Base Rate hikes, volatility in long-term interest rates heightening, and stock prices falling considerably.",
        "The member suggested that overall financial conditions still remained accommodative, since the credit supply had increased particularly in the corporate sector and was maintaining strong growth exceeding 9%, despite a trend of decline in M2 growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that a rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate stemming from the strengthening of the US dollar globally was not only becoming an additional factor causing price rises, but also could work to cause financial instability through the heightened volatility.",
        "The member thus expressed the need to pay attention to this point.",
        "Concerning financial imbalances, the member stated that, since household lending had shifted to an increase again and banks’ lending attitudes were easing gradually, it would be necessary to keep a close watch on the relevant trends in the future.",
        "The member also pointed to the need to keep in mind the high possibility of latent insolvency risks stemming from financial support measures, such as the deferment of principal and interest repayments for corporations and small businesses, and the extension of debt maturities.",
        "The member took the view that, in overall consideration of the growth, inflation and financial conditions of the domestic economy, it would be necessary to maintain the current Base Rate hike stance.",
        "The member stressed the utmost importance of preventing the spread and entrenchment of inflation to uphold a stable growth stance, since upside pressures on prices had grown further, while domestic economic growth would remain above the potential level.",
        "The member expressed the need to take preemptive measures, since a rapid rise in prices would inevitably call for tighter policy measures and this would eventually lead to greater losses to growth in the future.",
        "The member went on to present the opinion that hiking the Base Rate rapidly to the neutral level, to the extent that the domestic economy could withstand it, would be the best option to secure macroeconomic stability over a medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.75% from the current 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "Looking at the overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member judged that global inflation had been strengthened, and recovery in major economies had weakened, due to the war in Ukraine and prolonged lockdowns in China.",
        "The member stated that, on the domestic front, growth in exports had slowed due mainly to slower global economic recovery and supply disruptions, and it was difficult to pinpoint significant improvement in private consumption with the effects of supplementary budgets and excessive savings since the COVID-19 outbreak excluded.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that we were witnessing the development of unprecedentedly difficult conditions in which pressures on both the supply and demand sides were increasing simultaneously and there was a combination of supply-side shocks from energy, commodities, grain, and exchange rates.",
        "The member noted that in consideration of these changes in domestic and international conditions, the Research Department had revised downward the growth forecasts for this year and the next to the upper-2% range and the mid-2% range, respectively, and revised upward the inflation forecasts to 4.5% and 2.9%, and these directions appeared to be appropriate overall.",
        "However, the member judged that, concerning inflation, there would be additional upside risks, particularly since inflationary pressures this time were characterized by combined shocks which made it hard to create dichotomous divisions between supply and demand and between monetary policy and fiscal policy, and the shocks were unprecedentedly serious.",
        "The member judged that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate from the current level at this meeting in consideration of recent economic conditions and suggested a few reasons for this judgment.",
        "The member first saw that the gap between the inflation target and actual inflation seemed to be the widest since 2008, given that the inflation forecast of 4.5% for this year was the second highest following that in 2008 (4.7%) since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime, and that the inflation target had since been lowered to 2%.",
        "The member noted that comparing the current period with those of past supply shocks, there was clear upward trend in core inflation this time and thus it would be necessary to proactively deal with the second-round effects.",
        "The member took the view that, particularly since inflation expectations were rising rapidly and wages led by basic wages were growing, there was an urgent need to ease inflation expectations via a Base Rate hike.",
        "The member stated the need to lessen the risks related to capital flows in Korea, as risk aversion and volatility in the international financial market were increasing.",
        "The member commented that there were heavier depreciation pressures on the won and greater incentives for an increase in external debt, as residents’ direct and indirect overseas investment had been expanding and foreigners’ domestic portfolio investment was continuing to show a net outflow with the current account surplus narrowing sharply entering this year.",
        "The member saw that, since the recently rising medium- to long-term bond investment by the public sector was mostly not exchange rate-hedged, the impact of the gap between domestic and international interest rates was substantial.",
        "The member thus took the view that maintaining the gap between domestic and international interest rates at an appropriate level could be helpful in preventing a net capital outflow.",
        "The member stated that financial imbalances would need to be constantly addressed since the household debt-to-GDP ratio still remained high and corporate credit and market liquidity were maintaining rapid growth.",
        "The member added that an additional Base Rate hike was expected to contribute to improvement in financial imbalances by easing the decline in real financing rates in line with the rise in prices, and strengthening risk aversion.",
        "Meanwhile, the member judged that, although there were concerns about side effects of consecutive Base Rate hikes, such as slower domestic economic recovery, and an increase in private debt repayment burdens, and business failures in vulnerable sectors, the economy was still capable of enduring these effects, considering the results of monitoring via various indicators.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to carry out monetary policy to reduce the accommodative stance rapidly going forward, and a priority should be placed on dealing with inflation in that the inflation gap had widened sharply with the GDP gap remaining positive.",
        "However, the member noted that speedy Base Rate hikes could lead to default risk of vulnerable households.",
        "The member thus added that it would be necessary to continuously monitor the relevant risks, while stepping up policy efforts to improve the quality of the debt structure.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.75%.",
        "`□` Currently available information suggests that inflationary pressures have remained high, while the recovery of the global economy has moderated affected by the Ukraine crisis and lockdown measures in China.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have risen and the US dollar has strengthened considerably, due to expectations about a faster pace of the US Federal Reserve’s policy normalization.",
        "Stock prices have fallen sharply as risk aversion has strengthened.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries.",
        "`□` The Korean economy has continued to recover.",
        "Private consumption has improved rapidly supported by the lifting of social distancing restrictions, while facilities investment has continued to slow due to global supply constraints and exports have moderated.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its recovery supported by the improvement in private consumption, despite slower export growth owing to moderation in global economic growth.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be at the upper-2% level, somewhat below the February forecast of 3.0%.",
        "`□` Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to the upper-4% level due to the accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and industrial products, the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of personal services, and increases in electricity and gas fees.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the lower-3% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 5% range for some time, and run at the mid-4% level for the year overall, substantially above the February forecast of 3.1%.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to rise to the lower-3% level for the year overall.",
        "`□` In domestic financial markets, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly and stock prices have fallen while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated considerably, mainly driven by acceleration of the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate hikes as well as concerns over slowing economic growth in China.",

        "`□` The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board sees it as warranted to conduct monetary policy with more emphasis on inflation for some time, as the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties in domestic and external conditions.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing the trends of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, and external economic conditions including geopolitical risks."

        "At the January 11 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "This member noted that, affected by ongoing high interest rate policies, global inflation had entered a subdued phase and that inflation in most countries had been substantially down from its peak.",
        "The member projected that the global economy would slow somewhat with monetary tightening having repercussions in the real sector.",
        "The member however anticipated that global trade, which had been unusually sluggish last year, would recover gradually, having positive impacts on Korea’s exports.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member noted that growth was exhibiting a gradual recovery trend, boosted by favorable semiconductor and automobile exports, while domestic demand, such as private consumption and investment, had continued to show a weak recovery.",
        "The member assessed the labor market as being robust, with the unemployment rate hitting a record low of 2.3% in the third quarter of 2023.",
        "The member stated that the strong employment indicators were a result of growing economic participation by women and by the elderly, and went on to argue that a recovery in employment among young people would be needed to enhance long-term productivity and to expand growth potential.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member commented that consumer price inflation had continued to decline to 3.1% in the third quarter last year, and that it then rebounded somewhat to 3.4% in the fourth quarter.",
        "The member noted that the rebound had been attributable to supply shocks, including the fading away of base-period effects and the rise in oil and agricultural product prices, and projected that the gradual decline would continue unless there were additional supply shocks.",
        "The member also forecast that core inflation excluding food and energy would continue to moderate, to reach the lower 2% level at the end of the year.",
        "Going forward, however, the member expected that it might take a considerable period of time for inflation to converge on the target level due to favorable labor market conditions and persistent inflation.",
        "Concerning the financial sector, the member noted that difficulties in vulnerable sectors caused by persistently high interest rates were gradually becoming apparent, as seen in the escalating delinquency rates on loans to small businesses and on those related to real estate project financing.",
        "More specifically, the member pointed out that potential risks in financial markets had increased following Taeyoung E&C’s application for a debt workout plan, but that markets remained stable so far without concern spreading across the entire market.",
        "The member argued that it would be necessary to closely monitor future issues related to real estate project financing so as to prevent them from developing into systemic risks.",
        "The member believed that recent inflation developments have shown the tangible results of the high interest rate policy that the Bank has been maintaining to bring inflation down.",
        "However, the member also pointed out that it needed to maintain the tightening stance until it is confident that inflation is safely returning to the target.",
        "The member added that there had been past cases where long painstaking efforts turned out to have been in vain when inflation failed to become anchored.",
        "The member also stated that high interest rates help to strengthen the foundation for stable growth by reducing private debt and by securing future consumption and investment resources.",
        "The member mentioned that although recessions are painful, they also have a cleansing effect that allows the resolution of less competitive sectors so that resources can be used in a more productive manner.",
        "The member expressed the view that it was appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.5%, and to deal with the negative side effects of high rates with micro-level measures, such as ad hoc liquidity provisions, if necessary, while monitoring changes in domestic and overseas financial and economic developments.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member stated that the global economy saw a gradual slowdown in growth as the effects of monetary tightening continued, but that growth was expected to improve modestly after the second half of the year.",
        "The member noted that inflation in the major advanced economies continued an underlying trend of deceleration but still remained elevated, and was expected to take some time to stabilize at target levels.",
        "The member projected that the domestic economy would likely continue to improve modestly, with a weaker consumption recovery, but with ongoing strong exports.",
        "The member saw that employment remained favorable overall, although growth in the number of persons employed was gradually slowing.",
        "The member noted that the real estate market had seen a slowdown in transaction volumes and a downward shift in house prices in both the Seoul metropolitan area and in provincial areas, but that uncertainty remained high depending on the future policy direction.",
        "As for domestic inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation declined due mainly to lower petroleum product prices and smaller increases in other industrial product prices, and core inflation continued to decelerate.",
        "Going forward, the member expected domestic inflation to continue its underlying slowdown, but at a moderate pace due to the spillover effects of accumulated cost pressures.",
        "The member pointed out that financial and foreign exchange markets had seen a significant reduction in risk aversion sentiment since the December FOMC meeting.",
        "The member stated that government bond yields fell sharply due mainly to the sharp decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields, and short-term market interest rates also declined significantly.",
        "As for household loans, the member commented that other loans had declined, but housing-related loans had sustained strong growth, and delinquency rates on corporate loans had continued to rise led by loans to SMEs, but were still low compared to the long-term average delinquency rate in the past.",
        "The member presented the opinion that risks related to real estate project financing had emerged of late, but the impact on the financial system as a whole would likely be limited.",
        "However, the member saw a need to closely monitor future relevant developments.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in consideration of the overall domestic and international economic conditions, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that, while inflation was expected to continue in its underlying slowdown, it was still significantly above the target level and uncertainty surrounding the future inflation path persisted.",
        "In addition, the member saw that, while inflation expectations had moderated somewhat of late, it was expected to take some time to anchor at the target level.",
        "The member pointed out that, in light of these considerations, it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.5% at this Monetary Policy Board meeting and to maintain a tight monetary policy stance for a sufficient period of time until the Board was confident that inflation would stabilize at the target level.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, going forward, it would be necessary to make monetary policy decisions by closely examining the inflation path with a focus placed on anchoring inflation at the target level, while taking into account domestic and international economic conditions, changes in monetary policies of major countries, and risks to economy and financial stability.",
        "Another member suggested that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50%.",
        "The member observed that global financial market conditions had eased considerably with the U.S. long-term Treasury yield decreasing on heightened expectations of an earlier-than-anticipated pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "The member predicted that the global economy would continue its slow growth for some time due to tightening monetary policies, and that it would be affected by the pace of monetary policy shifts in major countries starting in the second half of this year.",
        "In the U.S., the member noted that the consumption slowdown had continued moderately, and that economic growth had slowed at a lower-than-expected pace.",
        "The member added that, while its inflation had slowed, core inflation had shown slower progress than anticipated.",
        "As for China, the member noted that domestic demand there has been sluggish, driven by the continuing real estate market slump, despite an accommodative fiscal policy.",
        "The member commented on the euro area, saying that its slump would continue for some time, weighed down by high inflation and high interest rates.",
        "The member assessed that, on the domestic economic front, the effects of monetary policy tightening were being transmitted to the real economy, as the recovery in private consumption was weaker than expected, construction investment remained sluggish, and as the increase in the number of persons employed continued to decline moderately, although exports were recovering.",
        "Going forward, the member expected economic growth to continue to improve moderately in the real sector, led by exports, and private consumption to recover to a level consistent with the potential growth rate this year.",
        "However, the member also saw that uncertainty surrounding the forecast path for private consumpion had increased since the pandemic outbreak, and, by their nature, facilities and construction investment and exports were subject to large forecast errors along their paths.",
        "The member thus stated that the outlook for future growth paths was more uncertain than in the past.",
        "The member stated that inflation had continued to slow moderately, consistent with the projected path, and that this trend was expected to continue this year, as well.",
        "However, the member pointed out that current consumer and core inflation were still well above the inflation target of 2%, and that the gap between them and the projected levels at the end of last year were quite large.",
        "The member saw potential upside risks to inflation coming from uncertainties in the pace of administered price increases in the future, from energy and agricultural and marine product prices, from the impact of the government's early fiscal spending in the first half of this year, from the speed of price transmission of accumulated supply shocks, and from geopolitical risks.",
        "The member noted that, in financial markets, tight financial conditions had eased somewhat, with domestic long-term government bond yields falling sharply as a result of the decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields due mainly to strengthening expectations of an early shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance.",
        "However, given that real estate prices had turned downward, growth in household debt had shrunk considerably, and that delinquency rates among households and corporations were increasing, the member judged that domestic financial conditions still remained tight.",
        "In addition, the member commented that, while the foreign exchange and financial markets had remained stable following the announcement of a debt workout application by a construction company, financial instability remained a potential risk, with widespread concern over the possibility of real estate project financing failures.",
        "The member considered it appropriate to respond with microeconomic policy measures targeted on the sectors triggering financial instability in the event that financial instability in certain sectors were to materialize in the future.",
        "The member saw that the domestic foreign exchange market had been generally stable and that foreign currency financing conditions had also been favorable.",
        "Taking into consideration these domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member saw a need to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50% this time and to monitor progress in the real economy and inflation relative to the projected paths for some time, while checking that both consumer and core inflation declined sufficiently in-line with their forecast paths.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that global economic growth had slowed, driven by the continuing tightening monetary policy stances in major countries and the weakened demand for services, and that this trend would continue into the first half of this year.",
        "The member also observed that international oil prices had fluctuated within a limited range, and that downward pressure would be dominant as supply and demand conditions improved.",
        "The member projected that it would take considerable time before inflation in major economies returns to the target, as the pace of slowdown will likely be modest despite a significant fall from its peak.",
        "With regard to global financial markets, the member observed that government bond yields had declined in major countries driven by heightened expectations of policy rate cuts, that the U.S. dollar had weakened, and that global equity prices had risen.",
        "The member noted, however, that entering this year, the expectations for policy rate cuts had somewhat weakened in major countries, partially reversing developments in those indicators.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member projected that the recovery momentum for consumption would weaken, while exports and facilities investment would continue to improve moderately, led by the recovery in the global semiconductor business.",
        "The member expected this year’s growth to be in-line with the November forecast.",
        "The member expected inflation to continue slowing this year.",
        "The member added that consumer price inflation is likely to approach the target level at year-end or early next year, and that core inflation seems to be gradually falling, considering the demand pressures.",
        "However, the member viewed that some evidence warrants caution against jumping to a conclusion that inflation had entered a period of stability in spite of the moderating indicators.",
        "The member pointed out that inflation had not been fully down, and economic agents’ sensitivity to prices still remained high, requiring caution against any remaining momentum for price change.",
        "The member concluded that a prudent approach, taking into account various indicators, was required, rather than putting too much meaning onto certain indicators.",
        "The member noted that in domestic financial markets short- and long-term interest rates declined and exchange rates fluctuated within a limited range mainly on developments of global financial market..",
        "In terms of household lending by financial institutions, the member expected that factors like strengthened government control of loans, housing prices that had shifted to declines, and a decrease in the number of housing transactions to come into play.",
        "However, the member added that any impact of the recent sharp fall in home mortgage loan rates should also be monitored closely.",
        "Despite the rise in delinquency rates at non-bank financial institutions, and credit events among some companies with larger exposure to real estate project financing (PF), the member believed that the risk is unlikely to spill over onto the overall financial system.",
        "However, the member argued that, given elevated wariness in the market regarding real estate PF loans, authorities should strengthen their monitoring and stand ready to face any market unrest.",
        "In summary, the member assessed that, despite the continuing modest improvement in the economy and inflation seemingly stabilizing, one should remain mindful of any lingering uncertainties concerning the disinflation outlook, and keep monitoring markets for financial stability.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned circumstances, the member believed that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period, and to maintain the tightening stance while closely monitoring developments of inflation and key indicators of the monetary policy transmission channel, until uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook are fully resolved.",
        "Another member argued that it would be appropritate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member stated that major economies had maintained price stability since the second half of last year and witnessed their growth and employment situations approach equilibrium levels.",
        "The member saw that the rapid expansion of the U.S. economy had slowed somewhat, but that it remained on track for a soft landing, sustaining favorable growth without massive job losses, with inflation decreasing.",
        "The member mentioned that, in the euro area, the manufacturing sector had been lackluster due to rising costs and a slowdown in China’s economic growth, and the services sector had exhibited a slower recovery, but inflation had fallen rapidly to the mid-2% range led by energy and food prices.",
        "The member projected that, in China, the real estate slump and geopolitical fragmentation had been working as a factor contributing to a strucutural slowdown in growth, but the pace of the slowdown would be modest, affected by economic stimulus measures.",
        "The member also forecast that the growth rate of the domestic economy would be in the lower 2% range, slightly surpassing the potential growth rate, and that inflation would gradually converge on 2%.",
        "The member stated that, according to an analysis by the Research Department, this projection was made based largely on favorable external conditions, such as a recovery in global trade driven by goods and IT demand, as well as falling international oil prices, despite a global economic slowdown this year.",
        "The member assessed that the growth exhibited qualitative improvements, as well, with an increased contribution from the private sector, especially in facilities investment, a reduced dependency on government spending and construction investment, and progress made on diversifying export destinations.",
        "The member however pointed out several factors continuously putting downward pressure on growth, such as a structural slowdown in private consumption affected by sluggish real income, increased debt-servicing burdens, and the population aging.",
        "The member also noted that weakening export and investment momentum due to global fragmentation and to increased offshore production, and weak employment growth among the prime working-age population in the labor market, were both factors putting downward pressure on growth.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member saw that market interest rates fell and stock prices rose as investor sentiment had improved, based on expectations of the easing of monetary tightening in major countries.",
        "The member however went on to state that potential destabilizing factors remained, such as rising delinquency rates on loans from non-banks, and heightening risks related to project financing following Taeyoung E&C’s application for a debt workout plan.",
        "As for FX markets, the member noted that, despite improvements in the current account, the won-dollar exchange rate, linked to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, had been fluctuating at around the lower 1,300 won level.",
        "In terms of household debt, the member assessed that housing-related loans had continued to increase while the decline in loans from non-bank financial institutions and unsecured loans had accelerated, and they went on to argue that it would be necessary to closely monitor future trends here.",
        "Summarizing all these economic and financial conditions, the member forecast that, while the economy would grow at a faster pace, there would be a further deepening divergence between the export and consumption sectors, and inflation would continue to moderate in its underlying trend.",
        "The member added that, in this regard, a need for further monetary tightening appeared to have decreased.",
        "The member however judged that, since consmer price inflation was expected to remain above its target for more than a year and since supply-side upward pressures remained, it would be necessary to maintain the current tightening stance for a considerable period of time.",
        "The member also argued that, in implementing a monetary policy pivot, priority should be placed on ensuring that inflationary pressures have slowed and that inflation expectations are stable.",
        "The member went on to state that consideration should also be given to domestic demand and private debt.",
        "At the February 22, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented on the global economy, saying that, despite the continuing services-driven recovery in demand, inflation had slowed due to weaker goods demand, a result of high interest rates and stabilized energy prices.",
        "The member pointed out that there were both upside and downside pressures in the U.S., with upside pressures being the continued fiscal expansion, inflows of direct and indirect investment, and the increase in productivity, and the downside pressures being the exhaustion of excess savings, slowed investment related to industrial policy, and the drop in the labor market vacancy rate.",
        "The member, however, saw that the dominant projection for the U.S. economy was that it would grow at more than 2% this year.",
        "The member added that despite the decline in goods prices, supercore inflation and housing services inflation had remained elevated, pushing back the expected timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pivot to beyond the mid-year.",
        "The member expected that growth would remain uneven across countries, with slowing growth in Europe and China due to high interest rates and a real estate slump, respectively, and solid growth in Japan and Asian emerging economies.",
        "The member assessed that Korea’s recovery had been sustained since the second half of 2023.",
        "The member observed that exports and facilities investment had continued to improve driven by the semiconductor sector, while the recovery in private consumption had weakened and construction investment had shifted to a decline.",
        "The member thought that private consumption growth would be unlikely to show any meaningful increase going forward, given the large debt repayment burden and a weakening of babyboomers’ propensity to consume following their retirement.",
        "The member analyzed that this weak domestic demand was a key driver of disinflation in Korea, as it makes it difficult to pass on accumulated cost pressures to the second round, even in the face of supply shocks, such as the surge in agricultural prices since the second half of last year.",
        "Regarding foreign exchange markets, the member observed that, despite the strong dollar, the Korean won had recorded a smaller depreciation than currencies of other major trading partners, driven by the expected increase in current account surplus and by a rise in foreign investment funds, and that FX liquidity conditions had remained sound.",
        "About financial markets, the member commented that despite the rise in market interest rates driven by weakened expectations for the U.S. Fed’s early rate cuts, market sentiments had generally remained stable, but that the potential risk associated with real estate project financing was still high, with home mortgage loans and corporate loans continuing to soar.",
        "In summary, the member mentioned that exports and facilities investment were the main drivers of growth with favorable external conditions, while private consumption was sluggish, and inflation continued to slow moderately.",
        "Considering the inflation outlook, the member expected that the real Base Rate would exceed the neutral rate of interest after the second quarter, constraining private consumption even further.",
        "The member believed, however, that it was too early to discuss a pivot, given that inflation expectations were still high at 3%, that consumer price inflation was expected to hover above the target level for a considerable time, and that the upside risk from supply still existed.",
        "The member added that caution must be taken against a premature expectation for a pivot, as it can stimulate home buyer sentiment, which had weakened since the fourth quarter of 2023, and push up private debt further.",
        "The member viewed, however, that a pivot could begin when it is sufficiently clear that inflation is converging toward the target level along the projected path.",
        "In this case, the member argued that coordination with macroprudential policy should be carried out first to contain any debt growth.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member noted that consumer prices were likely to experience temporary volatility as sluggish domestic demand is expected to continue for some time, but in the absence of unforseen external shocks on the supply side, they appeared to have entered a phase of secular moderation.",
        "However, the member argued that the downward trend would likely see resistance as it approaches the target, given uncertainties such as high agricultural product prices and instability in oil prices stemming from geopolitical risks.",
        "The member commented that, despite the overall slowdown in inflation, it is still above the target, and it appears that it will take some time for the gap between headline inflation and perceived inflation among individuals to narrow due to the already elevated level of prices.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had been supported by domestic demand, and mainly consumption, as trade had contracted significantly due to the intensified bloc formation and the fragmentation of the global economy since the pandemic, and it could be said that there had been a divergence in growth among countries based on the size of their domestic demand.",
        "The member commented that, currently, the growth rate was still below the long-term average, as the high interest rate situation had been persisting longer than expected, but it was expected to improve moderately in the second half of the year thanks to improved financial conditions and the resumption of global investment and trade.",
        "The member predicted that, going forward, regional and national economic performances would diverge depending on how swiftly and effectively each country’s economic policy responds to the easing of global tightening and improving trade conditions, on their ability to coordinate internationally, and on the resilience of employment.",
        "Meanwhile, the member saw that, in the domestic economy, the recovery in consumption was not meeting expectations and that growth was constrained by weak construction investment.",
        "However, the member expected growth to gradually moderate as consumer sentiment had increased slightly of late, and as the export sector offset weaker domestic demand, supported by improving global trade conditions.",
        "The member pointed out that, as the government's sound fiscal stance continued, the role and direction of monetary policy would be critical.",
        "The member noted that financial markets were seeing increased caution toward real estate project financing, particularly among non-bank financial institutions.",
        "However, the member believed that the potential for any spillover into financial system risks would likely be limited due to policy authorities' multifaceted responses, such as workouts, as well as to substantial loan loss provisions.",
        "The member pointed out that high household loans weigh greatly on the economy.",
        "Although its growth had been slow recently, the member believed that the level was too high, and thus would be a key factor along with housing prices in determining the timing of a pivot.",
        "The member added that growing uncertainties over the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in the second half of this year would likely increase volatility in financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "In the member’s view, Korea’s high reliance on foreign trade makes it sensitive to changes in trade conditions and exchange rates caused by policy shifts in major countries, and thus appropriate measures should be taken in advance.",
        "In consideration of the above-mentioned economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, the member assessed that the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member added that future responses should be made based on monitoring of changes in the external economic environment, such as monetary policy decisions in major countries, including the U.S., and geopolitical risks, as well as internal factors including the extent of vulnerability amid the high interest rate environment, the stability of the slowing trend of inflation, and developments among household loans.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member observed that global economic growth had fallen short of its long-term average, affected by global monetary tightening, but that growth had been uneven across countries.",
        "The member noted the view that, in the U.S., the pivot could come later than expected by the market, given the U.S.’s continuously solid labor market and strong growth.",
        "The member expected that the domestic economy would grow at around private consumption and construction investment, is weak.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation, which had rebounded to 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, fell back to 2.8% in January this year driven by a weakening in demand pressures and a decline in oil prices.",
        "The member projected, however, that it would take considerable time before inflation returns to the target level of closely related to people’s livelihood, remained at 3.4%.",
        "The member assessed that prolonged high interest rates had accumulated the pressure on vulnerable sectors of the economy.",
        "The member believed that although high interest rates weighed on household consumption, the first priority was to stabilize inflation.",
        "The member noted that households’ real purchase power did not improve last year, as the rate of increase in total wage bill was offset by consumer price inflation, which apparently weighed on consumption.",
        "The member believed, therefore, that stabilizing prices would help to improve households’ real purchasing power.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member saw that the market unrest caused by Taeyoung E&C’s application for a debt workout plan had eased to some degree.",
        "The member observed, however, that delinquency rates among real estate-related SMEs were rising, with corporate borrowing in the real estate sector increasing significantly.",
        "The member went on to state that the slump in construction investment would continue for a considerable time, with the impact of the drop in new construction being now in full swing, and that the risk associated with real estate project financing was unlikely to be resolved in a short period of time.",
        "The member added that this could potentially increase market strains at any time.",
        "The member offered the view that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged at the current rate of 3.50%, and that any negative side effects from high interest rates should be responded to appropriately with micro-measures.",
        "The member added that a close monitoring of financial and economic developments is needed to manage the real estate project financing risk and its consequent strains at non-bank financial institutions so that problems in small and medium-sized savings banks do not develope into a systemic risk.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member forecast that, due to the growing likelihood of an overall easing of monetary tightening in-line with the slowdown in inflation, the global economy would move away from high interest rates and high inflation and show a gradual improvement.",
        "The member projected that global trade had been recovering slowly and that it would expand gradually, depending on improvements in the global economy.",
        "By country, the member mentioned that, in the U.S., labor market-related indicators had been stronger than expected and inflation had been decelerating at a slower-than-expected pace, with consumer price inflation rebounding slightly and core inflation remaining unchanged.",
        "The member, however, stated that since economic indicators were exhibiting mixed signals, such as the more sluggish-than-expected consumption-related indicators in January, future developments of related indicators should be continuously monitored.",
        "The member predicted that China had been experiencing sustained deflation caused by sluggish demand and that the growth rate there would be slightly below 5% this year.",
        "The member, meanwhile, forecast that as global financial market conditions were expected to remain accommodative with a diminishing likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve further tightening, countries would likely show increasingly diverging policy stances from now on depending on their own economic conditions.",
        "The member added that some emerging market countries had already started lowering rates in consideration of their domestic economic conditions, such as the pace of inflation slowdown.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member noted that private consumption and construction investment had been more lackluster than expected, while exports had been stronger than initially projected.",
        "The member added that this resulted in an economic growth trend consistent with the original forecast, but that each sector of the economy exhibited differing trends.",
        "The member commented that the labor market had been sustaining a gradual deceleration in its underlying trend, if the unemployment rate, which had risen due to temporary factors, is counted out.",
        "The member projected that the growth rate would continue to improve, driven by exports, while private consumption would continue to exhibit a slower recovery than initially forecast.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member assessed that inflation continued to slow as originally projected and that demand-side pressures on inflation had weakened somewhat due to slower-than-expected private consumption.",
        "The member argued that, in this regard, the core inflation forecast path, which heavily relies on private consumption, could be adjusted slightly downward.",
        "The member however pointed out that upside risks to inflation still remained, including the pace at which the accumulated supply shocks affect inflation, as well as geopolitical risks.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that, since the January MPB meeting, global market expectations regarding the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cut had been adjusted following the release of U.S. employment and inflation indicators, which had surpassed market forecasts, and added that, as a result, long-term interest rates in major countries had risen and the U.S. dollar had strengthened.",
        "The member went on to state that domestic long-term government bond yields have risen as well, affected by the rise in U.S. long-term interest rates, and financial conditions have tightened somewhat.",
        "However, the member argued that, as overall liquidity conditions in financial markets were favorable, with short-term interest rates remaining stable, concerns about any spread of real estate project financing defaults have eased somewhat, but that related risks still remained, and that delinquency rates at banks and non-bank financial institutions have continued to rise, leading to a steady increase in the risk of sustained monetary tightening.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to prepare against the possibility of problems in vulnerable sectors leading to instability across the entire financial market.",
        "The member noted that domestic FX markets remained stable thanks to favorable global financial conditions.",
        "The member mentioned that, as major currencies depreciated due to the global strength of the dollar, the won-dollar exchange rate had risen accordingly, but that the extent of increase was limited relative to other currencies.",
        "The member also assessed that the domestic FX swap market had remained stable, with incentives for arbitrage trading decreasing and CDS premiums remaining low.",
        "Taking the domestic and international economic and financial environment into overall consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the risk from the easing of tightening had been reduced somewhat as inflationary pressures had weakened slightly due mainly to sluggish domestic demand.",
        "The member thus found it desirable to determine the appropriate timing of any easing after monitoring future developments in inflation and economic conditions, as well as domestic and international financial market conditions.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member forecast that the global economy would continue to slow for the time being due to global monetary tightening, but that it would start to improve gradually in the second half of the year, achieving more favorable growth than originally expected.",
        "The member stated that inflation continued to moderate in its underlying trend in the U.S. and other major advanced countries, but that the pace of the slowdown had been more modest than initially forecast.",
        "The member projected that the domestic economy would likely continue to show gradual improvement, led by exports.",
        "The member expected that, although private consumption had been recovering slowly, it would likely maintain a modest upward trajectory going forward, depending on future improvements in real household incomes.",
        "The member also anticipated that export growth would accelerate, boosted by a sustained recovery in the global IT industry and by persistent strong demand for imports in the U.S.",
        "The member forecast that facilities investment would emerge from its sluggishness and exhibit favorable growth led by investment related to semiconductors and related to new industries that are engines of economic growth, but that construction investment would likely remain more sluggish than previously expected.",
        "The member saw that employment was favorable overall, driven by persistent solid growth in the number of persons employed.",
        "As for domestic inflation, the member noted that the consumer price inflation rate had declined due mainly to slower growth in personal services and processed food prices, and that core inflation had also continued to decelerate.",
        "Going forward, the member expected domestic inflation to continue experiencing an underlying slowdown, but at a moderate pace due to the effects of rises in global oil and agricultural product prices.",
        "The member pointed out that financial and foreign exchange markets had been generally accommodative and operating smoothly, although major price variables had fluctuated substantially due mainly to changes in expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s early rate cut.",
        "The member stated that government bond yields had recently risen sharply, influenced by weakening expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s early rate cut, while short-term market rates fell and stock prices rebounded significantly.",
        "The member commented that delinquency rates on corporate loans had continued to rise led by loans to SMEs, while corporate financing had been proceeding smoothly overall.",
        "They went on to state that risks related to real estate project financing persisted, but that they were not significant enough to threaten financial system stability.",
        "The member presented the opinion that household loans exhibited slower growth owing to a decline in other loans, while housing-related loans sustained strong growth.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in consideration of the above-mentioned conditions, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that while inflation was expected to continue its underlying slowdown, it remained above the target level and that there was substantial uncertainty surrounding the future inflation path.",
        "The member went on to argue that, on the other hand, the economy demonstrated a modest recovery and forecasts indicated continued growth for this year and the next, potentially reaching or even surpassing its potential level, which suggested that there was no significant pressure to implement an early rate cut given the current situation.",
        "The member pointed to the need to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for some time and monitor the inflation path and movements of many related indicators until the Board was confident that inflation would stabilize at the target level.",
        "The member took the view that, going forward, it would be necesesary to make monetary policy decisions with a top priority placed on achieving price stability, while taking into account domestic and international economic conditions, changes in monetary policies in major countries, movements of the exchange rate, and risks to financial stability.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged and maintain it at 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that the global economy showed growth exceeding initial expectations, led by the U.S., and that it was expected to exhibit growth more favorable than initially expected, although growth would slow due mainly to ongoing monetary tightening in major economies.",
        "The member presented the opinion that inflation in the major advanced economies would continue its slowing trend, but that it may still take some time before the Board would be confident of its downward stabilization.",
        "The member saw that, since more-favorable-than-expected economic conditions were leading the inflation rate to decline at a slower pace, particularly in the services sector, any convergence on the target could be slower than expected.",
        "The member noted that, in international financial markets, price variables had fluctuated in-line with adjustments in expectations for monetary policies in major advanced economies.",
        "The member stated that, with central banks in major advanced economies having indicated that they would maintain their current high policy rate levels for some time, expectations for early rate cuts had weakened as subsequently released economic and inflation-related indicators had exceeded market expectations.",
        "The member added that, as a result, policy rate forecasts, as reflected in market price variables, had been revised upward and the U.S. dollar had strengthened.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy has continued its modest recovery, with exports improving, led by IT, although domestic demand, including consumption and construction investment, remained sluggish.",
        "The member noted that growth this year would be broadly in-line with the November forecast, but the divergence in growth between exports and private consumption would likely expand compared with initial expectations.",
        "The member projected that domestic inflation would continue its gradual deceleration.",
        "However, the member still saw the possibility of the deceleration slowing due to the great uncertainty surrounding oil prices stemming from ongoing geopolitical risks of late, as well as sustained high agricultural product prices.",
        "The member commented that, in financial markets, long-term interest rates rose due to changes in expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy and in geopolitical risks, and the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuated within a limited range.",
        "The member stated that stock prices rose on expectations of an improvement in the semiconductor industry despite weakening expectations of an early Fed rate cut.",
        "The member saw that household lending in the financial sector continued to grow at a slower pace overall, but that housing-related lending at banks has maintained a relatively high growth trend.",
        "The member pointed out that, in the credit and securities markets, credit spreads had narrowed considerably, and anxiety in the PF-ABCP market had eased somewhat.",
        "However, the member saw that difficulties in the rollover of some non-investment grade CPs persisted.",
        "The member projected that, overall, the economy has continued to recover modestly and that inflation is expected to continue to slow, albeit with uncertainty around oil prices.",
        "The member stated that household lending has been growing at a slower pace, but it will be necessary to monitor the still ongoing increase in home mortgage lending.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, in light of these considerations, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of to maintain a sufficient tightening stance so as to ensure that disinflation and deleveraging would be sustained.",
        "The member added that, as part of this process, it would be necessary to comprehensively examine domestic and external conditions, including future inflation developments, financial stability conditions, and the impact of monetary policies in major economies.",
        "At the July 11, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.5% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented that the global economy was expected to maintain modest growth as initially projected, while economic trends would continue to vary in major countries.",
        "Inflation continues to moderate in its underlying trend across all major countries, but the expected point at which inflation converges on the target level differs among countries.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member saw that the economy was exhibiting different trends across sectors, with exports remaining strong while domestic demand was more sluggish than expected.",
        "Private consumption showed strong growth in the first quarter, driven by one-off factors, before correcting in the second quarter.",
        "Construction investment remains lackluster due to the sluggishness of construction commencements and orders received, while facilities investment also suffers from delayed investment by some corporations.",
        "Going forward, economic growth is expected to remain consistent with the pace projected in May (2.5%), as exports are likely to maintain favorable growth, led by a buoyant IT industry, and consumption is also likely to recover gradually, affected by improvements in real income conditions and corporate performance.",
        "Affected by sluggish domestic demand, employment is forecast to show slower-than-expected growth, particularly in the contact-intensive services sector.",
        "With regard to the real estate market, the volume of housing transactions has been increasing, led by those of Seoul apartments, and housing prices have exhibited faster growth in the Seoul metropolitan region, while remaining on the decline in provincial areas.",
        "Concerning domestic inflation, consumer price inflation as a whole has been slowing, as core inflation continues to slow and as agricultural product price growth has recently decelerated significantly.",
        "Considering the base effect from last year’s surge in oil and agricultural product prices and the downward stabilization of core inflation, inflation will likely continue to slow going forward.",
        "Regarding international financial markets, the member noted that major price variables fluctuated substantially, influenced largely by changing expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and political uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe.",
        "In domestic financial markets, financial conditions continue to ease, as seen in the declines in market and lending rates driven by the preemptive reflection of expectations for a shift in domestic and international monetary policy stances.",
        "Growth in household lending, and home mortgage lending in particular, has been accelerating.",
        "The won-dollar exchange rate has risen, affected by the strengthening dollar and the weakening yen, and the foreign capital market remains stable.",
        "However, there are persistent uncertainties related to project financing restructuring, which is one risk factor in domestic financial markets, and exchange rate risks persist due to changing expectations of a shift in the U.S. Fed’s monetary policy, in addition to recent high exchange rate levels.",
        "In this regard, a close monitoring of relevant developments is required.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned economic and financial conditions, the member believed that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "Although there has been further progress in disinflation since the previous meeting, there remain uncertainties caused by geopolitical risks and weather conditions.",
        "Persistent expectations of high inflation necessitate a wait-and-see approach to determine whether inflation will converge on the target level, and it is necessary to consider financial stability aspects, such as increasing FX volatility, a substantial uptrend in household lending, and higher housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "In future monetary policy operations, the member stated that decisions about adjusting the monetary policy stance should be made after closely monitoring inflation and growth paths, examining financial stability risks, including monetary policy changes in major countries, upward pressure on exchange rates, and household debt, and should be made in consideration of monetary and macro-prudential policy coordination.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented that inflation is slowing in major countries and that some central banks are changing their policy stance accordingly.",
        "In the U.S., the unemployment rate has risen, implying a slight sluggishness in the labor market.",
        "However, it is uncertain when the U.S. is going to pivot, with some voices arguing that more confidence regarding disinflation is needed.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member expected GDP growth to be around 2.5% in 2024, in line with previous projections, due to sluggish domestic demand with high prices and high interest rates, although exports, including semiconductors, were strong.",
        "While aggregate labor market indicators, such as employment and unemployment rates, show favorable trends, the number of persons employed may increase at a slower pace due to the weak construction sector.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation and core inflation in June stood at 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively, converging on the target level of policy, is encouraging and this is thanks to the prolonged policy of high interest rates.",
        "If the downward trend in inflation continues, a rate cut could be considered, especially given the weak domestic economy.",
        "However, the member mentioned that two conditions have to be met first if there is to be a rate cut.",
        "First, there must be a stabilization of the foreign exchange market.",
        "Most of the currencies are weak because of the strong dollar.",
        "However, it is a red flag that the Korean won to U.S. dollar rate is stuck in the upper 1,300 won range, even when the current account is in surplus.",
        "Second, there must be economic restructuring and housing price stabilization.",
        "A possible rate cut should not undermine efforts to restructure the economy or trigger a rise in housing prices in some regions.",
        "It is also worrying that the increase in household debt is accelerating slightly, with most of it concentrated in home mortgages.",
        "The member saw that it is very disappointing that more aggressive deleveraging could not have been made while interest rates were high.",
        "Going forward, this may hinder Korea’s economic growth and limit the flexibility of monetary policy operations.",
        "The member assessed that, for now, the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level of 3.50%, while closely monitoring major countries’ management of their monetary policies, the process of project financing restructuring in the real estate market, and developments in financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50%.",
        "The member saw that the global economy has continued to grow at a moderate pace.",
        "Overall growth in the U.S. is favorable, although there are signs of a slowdown in consumption, and the eurozone economy is recovering, led by consumption, amid political instability.",
        "China is showing signs of a recovery with domestic stimulus measures and improved exports, although there is weakness in the real estate market.",
        "While some central banks‘ policy rates have started to move into less restrictive levels, expectations as to when and how many rate cuts the U.S. Fed will make have been highly volatile following the release of key U.S. economic data, leading to increased volatility in global financial markets.",
        "The member assessed that, although the domestic economy underwent a significant adjustment following the rebound in domestic demand in the first quarter, recovery has continued thanks to robust export growth.",
        "In terms of employment, additional monitoring is needed as the increase in the number of persons employed has recently slowed.",
        "Consumption adjusted in the second quarter after the strong increase in the first quarter, but recovery is expected to continue in the second half of the year.",
        "Meanwhile, construction investment is expected to decline due to the effects of the contraction in housing starts to date.",
        "Facilities investment is also expected to grow at a slower pace due to revised investment plans at IT companies.",
        "With regard to the domestic foreign exchange market, the member noted that the won-dollar exchange rate remained high, slightly below the 1,400 won level.",
        "Going forward, attention should be paid to the possibility that the exchange rate may become highly volatile due to political conditions in major countries, the weakening Japanese yen and Chinese yuan, and due to the continued reversal of the Korea-U.S. interest rate differential.",
        "As for inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation declined to the mid-2% range and that inflation expectations among the general public fell to the 3% range.",
        "As inflation slows in accordance with the forecast path, there are growing expectations that inflation will converge on its target level in the second half of next year.",
        "However, inflation expectations remain higher than the target level and adjustments in public utility charges are becoming more likely.",
        "Additionally, inflation may have become more sensitive to the exchange rate than before.",
        "In this regard, continued attention should be paid to future upside risks to inflation.",
        "The member commented that domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, affected by widespread expectations of rate cuts at home and abroad.",
        "Corporate financing and the supply-demand conditions for corporate and other credit bonds have been favorable, while money growth has remained in the upper 5% range.",
        "Risks related to project financing have been under control overall, as seen in the falling interest rates on PF-ABCPs.",
        "However, the member observed that household lending exhibited faster-than-expected growth, boosted by falling home mortgage rates, and the supply of government-sponsored finance, and that apartment sale prices and leasehold deposits have continued to rise, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "Looking back at patterns of the past, this trend can lead to overheating of the entire housing market.",
        "The member argued that particular attention should be paid to rising housing prices, as they could cause household debt to increase and housing expenses to rise, consequently limiting household consumption and aggravating inflationary presssure.",
        "More specifically, there is a higher likelihood of housing sale prices becoming more sensitive to lending rates, as household liquidity holdings have increased and recent housing transactions have been mostly driven by non-speculative demand.",
        "In this regard, inflows of liquidity into the housing market need to be closely monitored, considering progress in macro-prudential policy implementations, such as future management of policy loans and the introduction of stress DSRs.",
        "In summary, the member saw that, while inflation was slowing toward its target level, upside risks still required attention, and that, given current conditions, including exchange rate increases, household debt growth, and rising housing prices, any monetary easing would bring about higher risks than before.",
        "In light of this, it will be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.5% at this time and to leave it at the current level for the time being.",
        "The member pointed out that future monetary policy decisions should be made in comprehensive consideration of both the benefits and risks of any Base Rate adjustment concerning the overall economy and financial conditions, including growth and inflation, household debt and housing prices, and debt servicing burdens.",
        "This should include developments in external conditions and consequent FX market changes, such as those in exchange rates, any progress made in macro-prudential policy implementations, and the degree of convergence of inflation toward its target level over the medium-term horizon.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member commented that global and domestic economic conditions have followed a similar trend since the last meeting.",
        "Although the U.S. economy, which has led the global economy, is now slowing slightly, the global economy is expected to continue to expand moderately, supported by the recovery in the euro area and in emerging countries.",
        "The member observed that while the easing of the global contractionary stance and improving trade conditions are putting upward pressure on the economy, the persistence of high interest rates, never-ending regional conflicts, the strong dollar, which has recently become even more apparent, and political uncertainties, with elections in the U.S. and in other key countries, are all putting downward pressure on the economy.",
        "The member expects the Korean economy to grow at a slower pace in the second quarter due to weak domestic demand, particularly in retail sales, facilities investment, and construction investment, although exports were strong.",
        "However, the economy is expected to recover starting in the second half of this year.",
        "As we see that consumption and investment demand in major countries are spilling over into the manufacturing sector, supported by robust employment, a recovery in domestic demand would be crucial in order to follow the momentum of the global economic expansion.",
        "Though uncertainties still remain on the supply side, the member judged that prices are stabilizing, or at least the prices that are affected by monetary policy operations are on a downward trend toward the target level.",
        "The member stated that while the dollar remains strong and monetary policies are beginning to differentiate across countries, exposure to external risks has increased due to the restructuring of the foreign exchange market, making it necessary to monitor exchange rate volatility.",
        "The member saw that Korea’s financial and foreign capital markets have been stable overall.",
        "However, as housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan region are rising, leading to a significant increase in household lending, it is important to monitor economic sentiment in the real estate market and to manage household lending.",
        "In overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments, the member judged that there is not much need to adjust the current Base Rate and that it is therefore appropriate to leave it unchanged at The member noted that, as countries are differentiating their monetary policies according to their own economic contitions, Korea is also at a crucial moment when it needs to review the benefits and costs of a policy pivot on the real and financial sectors and the trade-offs in policy effects across sectors, and to find the right combination of monetary and macroprudential policies to minimize costs.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented that the global economy had been on a modest recovery lately, with a strong U.S. economy spilling over into other economies, including Europe, Japan, and China.",
        "The U.S. economy has made some progress on disinflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation declining slightly in May.",
        "However, the pace of disinflation is expected to remain moderate as the labor market remains strong, despite the gradual normalization of the labor market, with the June unemployment rate slightly higher than expectations.",
        "The euro area is improving slightly, led by exports, and the Chinese economy is showing signs of a recovery, but the real estate sector there remains sluggish.",
        "The Japanese economy has shown signs of a modest recovery, but it is somewhat unclear whether this will continue.",
        "The member pointed out that in the domestic economy exports were performing better than expected, influenced by the global economic recovery, whereas domestic demand, including private consumption, facilities investment, and construction investment, remained weaker than anticipated.",
        "The contrasting effects of external and internal demand are offsetting each other, leading to overall economic growth that does not significantly deviate from previous forecasts.",
        "In the labor market, the increase in the number of persons employed remained at a low level during May and June.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation continued to show a clear slowdown, largely in line with the forecast path, driven by falling agricultural product prices.",
        "In addition, based on the three-month moving average of month-on-month inflation, there has been significant progress in slowing consumer and core inflation, suggesting that the conditions necessary for a rate cut are largely met from an inflation perspective.",
        "The member saw that in international financial markets political uncertainties in Europe and in the U.S., as well as changing expectations regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cuts, had led to significant fluctuations and increased volatility in major countries' long-term government bond yields.",
        "This has also caused fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY).",
        "Meanwhile, the yen has continued to weaken significantly, which appears to be due to the prevailing expectation that Japan's policy rate and neutral rate will remain low for an extended period, given the condition of the Japanese economy.",
        "The Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate has risen due to increased political uncertainty in major countries and the significant weakening of the yen, but the possibility of a rapid change in the won/dollar exchange rate is considered limited, as global dollar liquidity remains abundant and as the dollar remains strong.",
        "The member pointed out that, in domestic financial markets, overall liquidity remained very favorable as short-term interest rates remained at low levels and as monetary (M2) growth slightly increased.",
        "In addition, the degree of tightening in financial conditions eased as long-term government bond yields declined significantly compared to those in major advanced economies, due to strengthening expectations of a pivot from a contractionary monetary policy stance at home and abroad, as well as to large net purchases of government bond futures by foreign investors.",
        "Meanwhile, the recent increase in housing transactions has led to a significant increase in home mortgage lending, and housing prices have been rising steeply, particularly in Seoul and in the greater Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "Given the historically high correlation between housing prices and household debt levels, it is necessary to be cautious about the possibility of another substantial increase in household debt if the upward trend in housing prices continues.",
        "Meanwhile, the delinquency rate on corporate loans, especially among non-bank financial institutions, continues to rise.",
        "In the case of real estate project financing, risks remain, particularly for some construction companies and non-bank financial institutions with significant real estate project financing exposure.",
        "As the net issuance of public corporation bonds is expected to increase in the second half of the year, it is necessary to ensure financial market stability to prevent financial market turbulence from materializing during the restructuring process of real estate project financing.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, taking into consideration these domestic and international economic and financial conditions, it is deemed appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this time.",
        "While pivot risk on the inflation side has significantly decreased, pivot risk on the financial stability side stemming from the expansion of housing price growth has increased.",
        "It will be necessary to closely monitor future developments in inflation and housing prices to determine the timing of a rate cut and it will be essential to coordinate closely with macroprudential policies to ensure that a rate cut does not amplify financial market instability.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member commented that the global economy maintained modest growth, boosted by a recovery in the global manufacturing sector.",
        "The economic upturn is expected to continue, but its pace will depend on the timing and pace of monetary policy shifts in major economies, alongside developments concerning geopolitical risks and political uncertainties.",
        "The member stated that inflation in major countries varied from country to country, but it was continuing to slow, with the pace generally becoming more moderate.",
        "However, after a temporary decline due to the announcement of smaller voluntary production cuts by OPEC+, international oil prices have risen again due to renewed military tensions in the Middle East and prospects of increased crude oil demand.",
        "The member saw that, in international financial markets, major price variables fluctuated repeatedly, influenced by changes in expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy and by a preference for safe assets resulting from political instability in Europe.",
        "The member noted that, concerning the domestic economy, while exports continued to show high growth, particularly in IT products, including semiconductors, domestic demand remained sluggish.",
        "Moving forward, the domestic economy is expected to show a moderate growth trend as robust export momentum continues and as sluggishness in domestic demand gradually eases due to slowing inflation and improving household real income conditions.",
        "The member saw that domestic inflation continued its slowing trend.",
        "In June, consumer price inflation eased to 2.4%, driven by a substantial deceleration in agricultural product price increases, while core inflation remained in the low it is important to remain vigilant about the developments and impacts of major upside risk factors, such as international oil prices, exchange rates, and agricultural product prices.",
        "The member commented that, in domestic financial markets, government bond yields declined due to expectations of a shift in domestic and international monetary policy stances, while the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate rose owing to increased political uncertainty in Europe, interest rate cuts in some advanced economies, and a weaker yen.",
        "The member stated that household loans in the financial sector were continuing to grow at a somewhat high rate, mainly driven by home mortgage loans.",
        "This appears to be because the expansion of government sponsored finance and the decline in bank mortgage lending rates have improved buying sentiment, which has led to an upward shift in apartment prices in the Seoul metropolitan area and to increased transaction volumes.",
        "Considering this situation, it is essential to pay close attention to the possibility of a resumption of a buildup in financial imbalances for the time being.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that the delinquency rate on corporate loans continued to rise, particularly in the non-banking sector.",
        "It is essential to closely monitor business conditions and financial risks in the construction and real estate industries, as well as the potential increase in risks within the non-banking sector during the restructuring process of real estate project financing.",
        "In summary, the member saw that inflation was expected to continue to decelerate and the domestic economy was expected to continue to show moderate growth.",
        "However, there is a heightened need for caution regarding the potential increase in volatility in foreign exchange markets, and the accumulation of financial imbalances, including rising housing prices and household debt.",
        "Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member was of the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "At the same time, it should be necessary to continue to effectively manage market expectations through appropriate communication to prevent excessive expectations of a shift in the policy stance that could escalate risks regarding foreign exchange markets and financial stability.",
        "At the May 23, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented that the global economy was exhibiting favorable movements, while different countries were likely to adopt diverging monetary policies as their economic conditions were varying.",
        "In the U.S., labor market imbalances have been easing, with the number of persons employed in the non-agricultural sector growing at a slower pace and the unemployment rate rising, while pressure on service prices appears to have been weakening somewhat, as evidenced by the continuing decline in the ISM services index.",
        "However, there is only a slight likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot to interest rate cuts in the near future, as March PCE inflation has rebounded and as core inflation has been decelerating far more slowly than expected.",
        "In the euro area, the ECB is likely to pivot toward rate cuts in the near future, as core inflation has been falling gradually despite being higher than the target level and as the real economy there has been growing only weakly.",
        "The Chinese economy has been showing limited improvement due to some constraints, including the continued sluggishness of the real estate market.",
        "In Japan, economic growth has slowed again, making it more difficult to normalize monetary policy, which has increased uncertainty about future yen-dollar exchange rate movements.",
        "International oil prices have fallen after a significant rise, in-line with developments of the Israel-Iran conflict, but with the recent weakening of OPEC+ solidarity, along with the increase in U.S. crude oil production and the possibility of further production, a spike in oil prices seems unlikely unless a significant unexpected geopolitical event occurs.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member saw that GDP showed favorable growth in the first quarter, with exports remaining strong and with private consumption growth far exceeding the original forecast, and that the real economy exhibited stronger-than-expected growth, with the number of persons employed in April rebounding to 260,000.",
        "However, further monitoring is required to determine whether such buoyancy of domestic demand, including private consumption, will continue.",
        "Meanwhile, risk from the easing of monetary tightening has been decreasing, given that consumer price inflation has returned to the 2% range, that core price inflation remains on a downward trend, and that the possibility of a spike in oil prices is low.",
        "A key condition for easing monetary policy is whether consumer price inflation aligns with the projected path, alongside the underlying downward trend in core inflation.",
        "The member commented that overall liquidity conditions appeared to be very favorable in the domestic financial market, as long-term Treasury yields fluctuated, affected by U.S. long-term Treasury bonds, while short-term interest rates remained low and the M2 monetary growth rate rose.",
        "However, given the steady growth in the loan delinquency rate at non-bank financial institutions and growing uncertainty surrounding future project financing restructuring, it is important to stay wary of possible financial market unrest caused by sustained monetary tightening.",
        "Meanwhile, household debt growth accelerated in April, as apartment sale prices rebounded in some areas and housing transactions increased.",
        "Household debt appears to be within a controllable range at the moment, but attention should be paid to prevent household debt growth from accelerating further.",
        "Even after several years of a steep rise in the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio, bank lending to the corporate sector continues to increase significantly, and, in this regard, close attention should be paid to risk management to ensure that corporate debt growth does not lead to a rise in the delinquency rate.",
        "With regard to the domestic foreign exchange market, the member noted that won-dollar exchange rate volatility increased in April, affected largely by the strong U.S. dollar, geopolitical risks, and the weak Japanese yen.",
        "However, the won-dollar exchange rate is unlikely to experience sudden fluctuations, as the U.S. dollar remains strong amid ample global dollar liquidity.",
        "In this regard, rather than focusing on temporary won-dollar exchange rate movements, it is better to seek ways to reduce the impact that dollar demand from residents’ outward investments has on the exchange rate.",
        "Given these domestic and external economic and financial conditions, the member found it appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of manifest, the inflation aspect requirements for easing monetary tightening appear to be gradually being fulfilled.",
        "However, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of stronger upward pressures on inflation if the real economy continues to be more favorable than expected, and therefore it is desirable to further monitor economic developments before deciding whether to ease monetary tightening.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it was appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting at 3.50%.",
        "The member saw that the global economy had sustained moderate growth, led by the recovery in manufacturing, while inflation had slowed.",
        "As a result, expectations of a soft landing for the global economy have heightened, while major central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve are expected to begin easing their contractionary monetary policy stance at some point this year.",
        "The member observed that the domestic economy continued to improve, with private consumption and exports showing unexpected recovery momentum.",
        "Labor market conditions have recorded both quantity and quality gains, not only in terms of the number of employed persons, but also in terms of hours worked and wages.",
        "Going forward, this would likely contribute to a moderate increase in the real purchasing power of households.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had decelerated in-line with the forecast, and expected it to reach the target level in the second half of to increases in oil prices and the exchange rate.",
        "Given the increased burden on households stemming from cumulated inflation, inflation expectations could remain elevated.",
        "The member was of the view that, although financial stability conditions remained generally stable, despite increased geopolitical risks and changes in the expectation of the U.S. Fed monetary policy, risk factors still exist.",
        "The Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate soared to the upper 1,300 won per dollar range, and fell back recently.",
        "However, it is necessary to remain vigilant, as changes in monetary policies in major economies could lead to further volatility in the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member believed that overall liquidity conditions in financial markets seemed generally favorable, given the increase in short-term standby funds, higher monetary growth, and lower credit spreads.",
        "Household and corporate lending has been growing at a faster rate, driven by lower lending rates and by the provision of policy funding, but further monitoring is required as to whether this trend continues into the future.",
        "The member presented the opinion that real estate project financing was unlikely to escalate into a systemic risk factor, considering the loss absorption capacity at financial institutions, and that the recently announced restructuring plan should be implemented consistently.",
        "In summary, the member saw that, while the growth trend has improved, risks from external conditions, such as the exchange rate, remain, and upside risks to inflation have increased.",
        "In view of this, it is desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and maintain it at the current level for the time being.",
        "The member also pointed out that, in the future, when to pivot monetary policy should be determined by comprehensively examining the stability of external conditions, such as the exchange rate, the confidence in inflation converging on the target level over the medium-term, and the burdens on economic agents stemming from maintaining the Base Rate at the current level.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate steady at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, while the global economy entered a soft landing phase, the pace of real economic recovery and inflation were showing differentiated patterns across countries, leading to diverse paths of policy rates.",
        "International oil prices and foreign exchange markets, which had been highly volatile, have recently calmed down.",
        "On the domestic economy, the member saw that exports, led by semiconductors, had recovered strongly and were driving growth.",
        "Domestic and international organizations are revising upward their economic growth forecasts for this year on the back of better-than-expected consumption growth in the first quarter.",
        "However, it remains to be seen whether consumption growth from the previous quarter will continue and if strong exports will lead to an increase in domestic demand.",
        "The member took the view that, while core inflation continued its modest slowdown, headline inflation had experienced a series of temporary rebounds, indicating that it would take considerable time to reach the 2% target.",
        "Meanwhile, upward pressures on inflation remain as the real economy is expected to show stronger growth than initially expected.",
        "However, as inflation slows, the previously stagnant real wages will shift to growth, leading to an increase in households' real purchasing power, which could positively impact future consumption.",
        "The member assessed that, while there was concern about rising delinquency rates among vulnerable borrowers due to prolonged high interest rates, the possibility of this escalating into a systemic risk was minimal.",
        "It is estimated that the household debt-to-GDP ratio will fall below 100%, achieving the short-term target, driven by efforts to reduce household debt.",
        "It is time to improve economic fundamentals by carrying out the deferred orderly restructuring of the real estate project financing sector and continuing deleveraging efforts, thus laying the foundation for sustained growth going forward.",
        "As the real economy showed better-than-expected performance, nearing its potential growth rate, the member believed that it would be desirable to maintain the tightening stance by keeping the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% until there was confidence that inflation would anchor at the target level.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member projected that although the global economy showed stronger-than-expected growth despite the impact of global monetary tightening, growth was likely to diverge across major economies.",
        "Inflation in major advanced economies has continued to slow, but the expected timing of inflation converging on the target varies across countries.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to show solid growth, as the recovery momentum of exports strengthens and as the slump in domestic demand, including consumption, becomes better than initially anticipated.",
        "Private consumption in the first quarter improved better than initially forecast, due to some temporary factors, and is likely to recover moderately after a period of adjustment.",
        "Exports are expected to sustain their solid growth, backed by the recovery in the IT sector and the acceleration of U.S. growth.",
        "Construction investment, which rebounded significantly in the first quarter, is forecast to weaken, while facilities investment is likely to improve driven mainly by the IT sector recovery.",
        "Labor market conditions are favorable in general, with the continuation of firm growth in the number of employed persons.",
        "The real estate market has seen the volume of transactions increase and sale prices rise slightly, mainly in Seoul.",
        "However, uncertainties are too large to regard these developments as signs of shifting to an uptrend.",
        "Domestic inflation is likely to remain subdued owing to a modest recovery in consumption, despite greater upward pressure from the upward revision of forecasts of growth, oil prices, and exchange rates.",
        "There are large uncertainties over the inflation trajectory concerning agricultural prices, international oil prices, and the exchange rate movement.",
        "In financial and foreign exchange markets, the member observed that major price variables had fluctuated, affected chiefly by changes in expectations of monetary policy in major economies.",
        "Household lending shifted to an increase mainly in housing-related loans, while corporate lending sustained a high growth rate, mainly in bank loans.",
        "The Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate has been volatile, with a significant increase followed by a decrease due to changing expectations of the timing of the Fed's rate cuts and due to events in the Middle East.",
        "The foreign currency money market has remained stable, but exchange rate risks remain concerning the shift in the Fed's monetary policy.",
        "Therefore, a close monitoring of relevant developments is essential.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned economic and financial conditions, the member expected that the growth rate would be higher than initially forecast, and that inflation would continue to decelerate.",
        "However, given the high domestic and overseas uncertainties over the inflation path, further observation of future developments is needed to be confident about inflation returning to the target.",
        "Thus, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.5% and to maintain the current contractionary stance for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member stated that monetary policy decisions should be made by closely monitoring the price and growth path and by examining domestic and overseas policy environments, including financial stability and geopolitical risk developments, household debt trends, and changes in monetary policy in major economies.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member commented that the global economy was showing more favorable movements than expected and that global trade was showing signs of recovery.",
        "Despite uncertainties surrounding the growth path caused by trade conflicts among major countries and geopolitical risks, the global economy is expected to maintain modest growth.",
        "Disinflation in major countries has been continuing slowly due chiefly to a persistently high increase in service charges and a rebound in energy prices.",
        "International oil prices rose in early April following the Israel-Iran conflict, and then have fallen back, while high uncertainties remain owing to geopolitical risks.",
        "Regarding international financial markets, the member noted that concerns about a delay in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cut had been growing steadily and then eased in May, and went on to state that major price variables had fluctuated accordingly.",
        "Long-term Treasury bond yields in major countries shifted to a decrease in May after having continued to rise in April.",
        "The member saw that the rate of domestic economic growth in the first quarter was well above the previous forecast, boosted by significant improvements in net exports and stronger-than-expected improvements in consumption and construction investment.",
        "Going forward, the domestic economy will likely experience uncertainties related to developments in the IT industry and monetary policies in major countries, but the growth rate for this year is forecast to be much higher than originally projected, led by persistently strong exports and a modest consumption recovery.",
        "The member assessed that domestic inflation continued to slow.",
        "Core inflation and consumer price inflation have declined in-line with the deceleration of the upward trend in personal services inflation and agricultural product prices.",
        "Looking ahead, domestic inflation will likely continue to slow gradually, but uncertainties related to movements in oil prices, the exchange rate, and agricultural product prices, as well as the extent of the spread of price increases across companies, remain on the future path of inflation.",
        "Improvement in the growth rate, in particular, is a factor adding to demand side inflation pressures, and, in this regard, its impact on disinflation needs to be closely monitored.",
        "As for domestic financial markets, the member observed that Treasury bond yields had risen and then fallen back in-line with changes in expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy stance, and that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had spiked before significantly dropping in May.",
        "Household loans in the financial sector, which had been decreasing, shifted to positive growth in April, mainly driven by home mortgages.",
        "With the slight improvement in home buyer sentiment and the decline in interest rates on bank loans, the trend of household loans warrants continued monitoring.",
        "Meanwhile, progress on restructuring troubled real estate project financing businesses under government measures, changes in the business conditions in the construction and real estate industries, and the soundness of non-banks and their capital flows, all need to be carefully monitored.",
        "In summary, the member projected that the domestic economy would sustain its growth recovery, while inflation would continue to decelerate.",
        "However, domestic and overseas uncertainties over the inflation path are likely to pose a risk to the downward stabilization of inflation.",
        "Given the overall circumstances mentioned above, the member believed that it was appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "After experiencing high levels of inflation, anchoring inflation expectations is more important than ever.",
        "Considering how unclear the impact of changes in domestic and overseas policy environments on disinflation is, monetary policy operations require a careful approach with a close monitoring of inflation developments.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member commented that, concerning the global economy, global growth forecasts had been revised upward since the start of the year thanks to growing expectations of a soft landing, but since April growth had been somewhat constrained by slower progress in disinflation in major economies, which had dampened expectations of rate cuts, as well as by instability in the Middle East.",
        "However, the underlying growth momentum is expected to continue, influenced by a still strong U.S. economy, a gradual economic recovery in Europe, and diminishing concerns of a hard landing in China.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy in the first quarter showed growth that significantly exceeded expectations, driven by a strong recovery in exports from the IT sector, including semiconductors, and an increase in consumption due to temporary factors.",
        "The member expected the economy to experience a significant correction in the second quarter, as the temporary factors dissipated and in consideration of a slower recovery in industrial production, and then to demonstrate a moderate growth trend from the second half of the year.",
        "However, in contrast to the rapidly growing export sector, the prolonged high interest rate environment and the weakened spillover effects of exports onto domestic demand since the pandemic have intensified the imbalance with the domestic demand sector, which has not yet reached its normal trajectory.",
        "This imbalance remains a major consideration when setting policy directions.",
        "The member commented that inflation was expected to continue its moderate slowdown, mainly driven by core inflation, despite upside risks from supply-side pressures, including geopolitical risks and high exchange rates, along with the upward revision of the growth forecast to be above the potential growth rate.",
        "The member took the view that, while the exchange rate remained at a high level, changes in external conditions, including U.S. economic indicators, and the widening divergence of monetary policies across countries, would likely increase volatility, despite favorable domestic foreign exchange liquidity and foreign currency financing conditions.",
        "The member noted that financial stability indicators were positive, with government bond yields and lending rates falling and with money markets generally being assessed as stable.",
        "However, it is worth noting that delinquency rates are rising among households and SMEs, and there has been a recent rebound in household loans, as well as a steady increase in corporate loans.",
        "The member saw the need to eliminate potential and psychological financial system instability factors by accelerating the implementation of the announced real estate project financing soft landing measures, while complementing and managing liquidity and credit risks that may arise during the restructuring process.",
        "The member believed that, given the current domestic and international economic conditions, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "Going forward, the path of the Base Rate should be determined by considering changes in external variables, such as the direction of monetary policy decisions in the U.S. and other major countries, inflation trends, and the restoration of the balance between the domestic demand and export sectors.",
        "At the April 12, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member commented that the global economy has been growing moderately overall due to monetary policy tightening, with the U.S. sustaining growth far exceeding initial expectations.",
        "Going forward, the global economy is expected to show improvement in-line with progress on disinflation, but uncertainties along the growth path stemming, for instance, from geopolitical risks, are assessed to be significant.",
        "The member saw that inflation in major economies continued to slow, but the process of converging on the target remained uneven.",
        "Service prices remain elevated, constraining rapid disinflation, and recently elevated international oil prices are likely to remain high for some time due to rising geopolitical risks and due to extended production cuts by OPEC+.",
        "The member noted that, in international financial markets, key price variables have fluctuated, largely influenced by changes in expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy.",
        "Long-term government bond yields in major economies, which had fallen in anticipation of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, rose again due to factors such as economic indicators surpassing market expectations, and the U.S. dollar also showed strength.",
        "The member saw that the domestic economy continued to improve on the back of ongoing strong exports, despite a modest recovery in consumption.",
        "Going forward, with continued strong exports and a gradual recovery in domestic demand, including consumption, growth for the year as a whole could surpass the February forecast.",
        "The member noted that, looking at domestic inflation, while core inflation continued its underlying slowdown trend, the slowdown in consumer price inflation was tempered by continued high agricultural product prices and by rising petroleum product prices.",
        "Going forward, a moderate slowdown in core inflation is expected, but the slowdown in consumer price inflation is expected to be bumpy, depending on agricultural product price developments and international oil price movements.",
        "The member commented that, in the domestic financial market, long-term interest rates had rebounded of late due to weakening expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut, and that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had also increased influenced by the weakening of currencies in neighboring countries, such as the yuan, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.",
        "Stock prices have risen, driven by improvements in the semiconductor industry.",
        "The member stated that, looking at household lending in the financial sector, growth in mortgage loans slowed, while other loans continued to decline.",
        "Given weakening expectations of housing price increases and the outlook for continued sluggishness in the real estate sector, household lending growth is expected to remain low for the time being.",
        "Meanwhile, the member presented the opinion that, as loan delinquency rates for real estate project financing and at non-bank financial institutions continued to rise, it would be necessary to examine risks more closely, keeping in mind the possibilities of deterioration in asset quality of related financial institutions, as well as of the weakening of their financial intermediary functions.",
        "The member saw that, in summary, while the economy would continue a gradual improvement, inflation was expected to remain on its underlying slowing trend.",
        "However, risks in the final stages of disinflation are assessed to persist, including the still high uncertainty surrounding international oil price and agricultural product price forecasts.",
        "The member presented the view that, taking all these factors into overall consideration, it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "Given that this is a critical period for the stabilization of inflation expectations to ensure the downward stabilization of inflation, it is necessary to sufficiently continue tightening, the member noted, until there is confidence that inflation expectations have stabilized enough to withstand some degree of supply shock.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and to maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member commented that the global economy was visibly recovering, driven by stronger-than-expected growth of the U.S. economy, which has led to upward revisions in global economic forecasts, alleviating concerns about a hard landing.",
        "There is a growing consensus that the global tightening cycle may have reached its peak, leading to a gradual easing of monetary policy.",
        "This easing is expected to act as additional upward pressure on growth prospects.",
        "Going forward, countries are likely to adopt varying monetary policies based on their domestic economic conditions and inflation rates.",
        "However, the member stated that a slower-than-expected disinflationary trend could have the potential to contstrain any positive momentum in the real economy by delaying the timing of the monetary policy shift.",
        "Unpredictable geopolitical risks and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election are the variables that will have the greatest impact on global investment and trade conditions.",
        "The member saw that the domestic economy was showing moderate growth with exports, including semiconductors, leading the recovery, as external conditions improved.",
        "However, due to high interest rates and inflation, consumer and investment capacity has weakened, exacerbating the imbalance between domestic demand and exports, and sectoral differentiation in the labor market is also happening.",
        "To sustain the current economic recovery momentum, efforts to stabilize prices and buffer downward risks to consumption should be key priorities for future economic policy.",
        "The member stated that inflation was expected to continue on an underlying downward trend.",
        "While core inflation is on a broadly stable downward trend, consumer price inflation is likely to experience intermittent bumps along the way to the target due to supply-side shocks, including instability in international oil prices and volatility in agricultural product prices.",
        "The member noted that the recent slowdown in household lending, based on stable housing price movements, had reduced risk factors in financial markets.",
        "With the exception of some non-banking financial institutions, there are no signs of liquidity pressure yet, and the real estate project financing situation is unlikely to lead to financial system instability, but an orderly restructuring is still needed to prevent potential risks from materializing.",
        "Despite strong exports and the accompanying widening of the current account surplus, net foreign exchange inflows, and stable foreign capital market conditions, the member saw the need to strengthen monitoring of exchange rate movements, which remained high.",
        "As corporate debt is higher and rising at a faster pace than in major economies, and as delinquency rates are rising relatively sharply, it is deemed necessary by this member that the level of vigilance be raised in order to prevent corporate financial risks from being linked to financial instability factors.",
        "Given these domestic and external economic conditions, the member found it appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% at this time.",
        "Amid the strengthening need for a recovery in weakened domestic demand momentum, it is desirable to take responsive actions with consideration to future policy rate decisions in major economies, such as the United States, the trajectory of prices, and the flow of household debt linked to the real estate market.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged and maintain it at 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that, amid a favorable global economic movement, the anticipated timing of a shift in the tightening policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve had been delayed in international financial markets, as economic indicators from the U.S. had been solid.",
        "Specifically, the U.S. economy is showing a growth trajectory surpassing expectations, as consumption remains strong and as the labor market demonstrates robust performance, potentially resulting in a slower-than-expected inflation deceleration due to demand-side pressures.",
        "In the euro area, although weakness persists, a gradual improvement is expected as it moves away from the era of high interest rates and inflation.",
        "Despite ongoing weakness in the real estate market, China's economic indicators have been picking up recently, led by manufacturing and exports, on the back of increased government policy support.",
        "As for the domestic economy, the member noted that consumption had been sluggish while exports had been robust, exhibiting uneven growth across sectors.",
        "Private consumption, which had been in a slump since the second quarter of 2023, has remained lackluster this year, with the February Retail Sales Index declining significantly.",
        "On the other hand, the extent of growth in exports began to increase gradually from the first half of 2023.",
        "Customs-cleared exports have remained favorable and the current account surplus has continued into number of persons employed driven mainly by women and the elderly, and in the services sector.",
        "However, as the extent of increase narrowed more substantially than expected in March, it would be necessary to keep a close eye on future developments.",
        "While exports are projected to continue their steady rise, private consumption is expected to recover modestly.",
        "Going forward, the domestic economy is likely to witness differentiation across sectors for some time.",
        "The member commented that consumer price inflation had recently rebounded owing to rises in agricultural prices and global oil prices.",
        "However, core inflation, implying the underlying trend of prices, has continued to slow.",
        "As the persistence of tepid private consumption leads to the weakening of demand-side pressure as well, inflation is expected to show a modest slowdown, led primarly by core inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, it is worth noting that uncertainties over the projected inflation trajectory have increased due to a potential resurgence in agricultural prices and an increase in international oil prices arising from geopolitical risks.",
        "Moreover, it is necessary to prepare for the possibility that greater volatility in domestic agricultural prices could be a structural problem caused by climate change.",
        "Meanwhile, the member observed that in global financial markets since the February MPB meeting, long-term Treasury yields had fallen and then rebounded due mainly to changes in the expected timing of the Federal Reserve’s policy pivot following the release of U.S. economic indicators.",
        "In domestic financial markets, long-term government bond yields have been stable, fluctuating within a narrow band, as expectations regarding monetary policy in Korea remained steady.",
        "The downward trend in the domestic real estate market has slowed, with some signs of a rebound in apartment prices in certain regions.",
        "Although growth in household loans has been decelerating, the delinquency rate has been on a sharp rise.",
        "As for corporate credit, the delinquency rate rose steeply amid its rapid increase.",
        "Real estate project financing loans have been generally stable amid favorable liquidity conditions in financial markets as a whole.",
        "However, due to high uncertainties regarding the repercussions of future project financing restructuring and the fast-rising delinquency rate at some non-bank depository institutions with large exposure to the real estate sector, it is judged that financial risks due to tightening have been increasing gradually.",
        "In the domestic foreign exchange market, the Korean won to the U.S. dollar exchange rate also rose due to the global strengthening of the dollar.",
        "However, the foreign money market exhibited stable movements across the board, with incentives for arbitrage trading declining and CDS premiums staying low.",
        "Considering the domestic and external economic and financial conditions above, the member assessed that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The general public’s perception of economic conditions has recently worsened due to weak domestic demand, and the construction and real estate sectors have seen a steep rise in delinqency rates.",
        "However, consumer price inflation picked up and there are some signs of apartment prices rebounding in some regions.",
        "Both the risks from the ongoing tightening and the easing of tightening have increased, weighing more on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Going forward, the timing of rate cuts should be decided by closely monitoring economic developments including inflation and domestic demand, as well as financial conditions at home and abroad, and it would be desirable to minimize risks caused by the easing of tightening through coordination of macroprudential policies with financial authorities.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate steady at the current level of 3.50% for the inermeeting period.",
        "The member judged that the global economy would likely improve gradually going forward with better-than-expected growth.",
        "The U.S. has sustained its robust growth, significantly surpassing initial projections largely due to domestic consumption.",
        "The euro area has exhibited tepid growth owing to elevated interest rates, but is projected to show a modest recovery after the second half of the year.",
        "In China, the real estate sector is expected to remain sluggish, but is likely to continue a modest recovery trend thanks to government pump-priming measures.",
        "In major economies, although inflation has continued to decelerate, core inflation is coming down at a slow pace.",
        "The member saw that the domestic economy was projected to improve continuously as initially anticipated.",
        "Regarding private consumption, while goods consumption has been slow, it is expected to recover modestly going forward.",
        "Exports have continued to show solid growth on the back of the recovery in the IT industry and are forecast to improve steadily.",
        "Construction investment, which rebounded sharply early in 2024, is expected to shift to a decrease, while facilities investment will likely continue its improvement supported by the recovery in the IT sector.",
        "It is judged that the job market has been strong in general.",
        "Although the real estate sector is likely to remain stable for the time being, uncertainties are high.",
        "Domestic consumer price inflation in March stayed at 3.1%, the same as the previous month, due to increases in agricultural prices and global oil prices.",
        "However, core inflation decreased, sustaining the underlying trend of a slowdown.",
        "Inflation expectations resurged in March due to high agricultural product prices.",
        "Inflation is projected to continue its slowing trend owing to the sluggish recovery in consumer spending.",
        "However, along the future trajectory of inflation, there is a high level of uncertainty associated with factors such as movements in agricultural prices and global oil prices, as well as geopolitical risks.",
        "The member noted that in global financial and foreign exchange markets, major price variables had fluctuated owing to changes in expectations of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "In local financial markets, however, financial conditions have continuously eased, with falling short- and long-term interest rates and a stock price rally.",
        "The Korean won to the U.S. dollar exchange rate has risen significantly on concerns about delayed rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and its volatility has expanded.",
        "Growth in housing-related loans has been slow, but corporate loans have been growing rapidly led by bank lending.",
        "Recently, the growth rate of M2 has also been rising to some extent.",
        "Considering all the conditions mentioned above, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "While inflation is expected to slow continuously as an underlying trend, there is still high uncertainty surrounding the future inflation path due to supply-side risks.",
        "The delinquency rate on corporate lending has increased and real estate project financing risks have remained, but, for now, their impacts on the financial system as a whole seem limited.",
        "In terms of economic activity, growth is projected to continue at or above the potential level, and financial conditions have been continuously easing.",
        "Thus, it is assessed that there is no need to rush to pivot from the stance of monetary tightening.",
        "Uncertainties along the inflation path still remain and if the process of bringing down inflation to the target level is delayed, the cumulative burden of inflation could increase and thus undermine the stability of the currency value.",
        "Therefore, it would be desirable to maintain the stance of monetary tightening for a sufficient period of time.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member saw that major economies, amid slowing disinflation, were showing differing growth rates depending on the degree of their adaptation to changes in industrial structure and technologies in the post-pandemic era.",
        "In the U.S., amid sustained demand growth driven by robust employment and expansionary fiscal policies, disinflation and growth expansion are taking place simultaneously.",
        "Positive supply shocks have also occurred due to the progress made in automation in response to the contraction in global value chains and to expanded investment following aggressive industrial policies.",
        "European countries, on the other hand, have been simultaneously experiencing both declining inflation and sluggish growth due to a stagnation in labor productivity resulting from the sluggish manufacturing sector and to a delay in any recovery in demand.",
        "In addition, countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Sweden, which experienced a surge in private debt during the pandemic, are growing slowly this year due to the effects of an extended period of high interest rates, similar to last year.",
        "The member stated that, in Korea, while exports and investment in major manufacturing industries such as IT and automobiles had been strong and expanding, consumption had been lackluster and labor productivity had been declining, particularly in the services sector, leading to deepening sectoral divergence.",
        "The recent surge in exports is likely to boost growth in business and household income, leading to a recovery in domestic demand and thus have a positive effect on the overall economy.",
        "However, given the impact of elevated inflation, the accumulated debt repayment burdens, and low consumption propensities among baby boomers, it is difficult to dismiss the possibility of sluggishness in consumption evolving into a prolonged structural phenomenon.",
        "The member commented that, while demand-side inflationary pressures have remained subdued in Korea due to sluggish domestic demand, supply-side inflationary pressures have increased even further, driven by recent surges in agricultural product prices, as well as rises in global oil prices and the exchange rate.",
        "It would be premature to conclude that the economy has deviated from the February forecast path, given the mix of upside and downside risks, the member noted.",
        "However, since significant uncertainties persist, it is necessary to carefully monitor the future price path while keeping a close eye on these uncertainties.",
        "The member assessed that foreign exchange and financial markets remained stable overall thanks to reductions in medium- and long-term foreign currency borrowing premiums and in corporate bond credit spreads, as well as net inflows of foreign portfolio investment, which offset rises in the won-dollar exchange rate and in long-term market rates caused by the expected delay of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cuts.",
        "However, potential destabilizing factors due to interaction between debt and high interest rates persist, including growth in delinquencies, particularly on loans to vulnerable households and in the construction and real estate sectors, and there were concerns regarding a possible deterioration in asset quality at certain non-bank financial institutions.",
        "Given the economic and financial conditions mentioned above, the member noted that there was an increasing need to normalize interest rates to mitigate persistent sluggishness in domestic demand and alleviate the accumulated burdens from borrowing.",
        "However, significant uncertainties persist both domestically and internationally surrounding the price path, and more time for observation is needed to determine whether stability has been achieved in real estate market sentiment and household debt.",
        "In this regard, it was deemed appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, interest rate normalization can be initiated once we are confident that supply-side pressures on prices will not increase and that prices will align with the current forecast path, the member noted.",
        "This should be accompanied by an active use of supplementary policies, including macroprudential and foreign exchange policies, to prevent the occurrence of internal and external financial imbalances.",
        "Above all, considering that the role of monetary policy is primarily to mitigate economic fluctuations rather than to drive long-term structural improvements, it is crucial to examine how central bank balance sheet policies are used and at the same time, efforts should be maintained to propose policies aimed at implementing structural reforms and in enhancing productivity.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member saw that, while global trade had begun to recover modestly from its slowdown, many countries were still exhibiting weak growth.",
        "Consequently, interest rates are expected to vary across countries accordingly.",
        "The U.S., in particular, continues to experience higher-than-forecast growth and robust employment, with consumer price inflation standing at 3.5%, up from the previous month.",
        "As a result, mounting concerns have arisen regarding a potential delay in rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "The member mentioned that, despite sluggish retail sales attributed to high inflation and high interest rates, the domestic economy was forecast to grow by around 2.1% annually, boosted by favorable exports, particularly in semiconductors.",
        "However, economic sentiment is expected to vary significantly across sectors.",
        "Regarding the labor market, aggregate indicators, such as employment and unemployment rates, have been showing favorable trends despite subdued domestic demand.",
        "This has been driven by sustained growth in the labor supply of women and of the elderly.",
        "The member observed that consumer price inflation was expected to maintain a moderate slowdown, but that uncertainties persisted due to increases in agricultural and global oil prices.",
        "Despite the current account surplus, the exchange rate remains high, driven by global dollar strength, which may contribute to future import price hikes.",
        "Core inflation, excluding highly volatile food and energy, stands at 2.4% year-on-year and continues to show a downward trend.",
        "However, CPI for living necessaries, representing items on which households spend a substantial amount, has risen to 3.8% year-on-year from the previous month’s 3.7% (in February).",
        "To stabilize prices of essential goods, crucial for low-income households, more structural and fundamental policies are needed.",
        "These include improving distribution structures and decisively easing import regulations.",
        "The member saw that, while the adverse effects of prolonged high interest rates were evident across the economy, it was still crucial to prioritize price stability.",
        "It is now the time to maintain the Base Rate at its current level of 3.5%, the member noted, and closely monitor unfolding trends in major countries’ monetary policies, while paying close attention to the future resolution of real estate project financing loans and the subsequent situation of non-bank financial institutions.",
        "At the August 22, 2024, Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at the 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member judged that, considering the persistently strong U.S. economy and the easing of sluggish growth in the euro area, the global economy would maintain its modest growth, although the pace of its recovery might be slower than initially expected.",
        "The member stated that, recently, unexpected U.S. economic data had greatly shocked financial markets temporarily and raised concerns about an economic recession, but that the U.S. economy is generally unlikely to deviate from the expected soft landing path.",
        "Conflicting signals from U.S. employment indicators are being seen as the labor market gradually returns to its equilibrium level after exhibiting historic growth since the pandemic, rather than representing any downside risk to the U.S. economy.",
        "The member forecast that, although the domestic economy recorded negative growth in the second quarter, affected by substantial corrections in domestic demand -- in particular, private consumption and investment, owing chiefly to base effects -- the economy would exhibit favorable growth in annual terms, with strong export growth acting as a key driver of economic growth.",
        "However, growth momentum is expected to weaken somewhat, as global trade is likely to improve slowly and as domestic demand will likely recover at a slower-than-expected pace due to complex and unpredictable geopolitical risks.",
        "The member stated that consumer price inflation had rebounded temporarily in July driven by fluctuations in global oil prices and a reduction in the fuel tax cut rate.",
        "The member, however, projected that consumer price inflation would continue its downward trend and gradually approach the target level, influenced by reductions in supply-side inflation pressure.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member noted that restrictive financial conditions have continued to ease, while Treasury bond yields declined substantially, widening the inversion between the Base Rate and Treasury bond yields, driven by the spread of expectations of a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and by Treasury bond futures purchases by foreign investors.",
        "Herd behavior in the bond market seems to have resulted from excessive expectations concerning future U.S. and Korean monetary policies, and as such expectations can suddenly be reverted in the future, careful attention to market volatility is necessary.",
        "The member was of the view that, as the disparity in economic growth between the U.S. and other major countries has been narrowing and as a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve is now in sight, there is growing likelihood that factors supporting the strong dollar will gradually weaken.",
        "In this regard, although concerns remain in the foreign exchange market, upward rigidity of the won-dollar exchange rate is expected to strengthen gradually.",
        "The member presented the view that, given these domestic and external economic conditions, and, specifically, housing price hikes in the Seoul metropolitan region and the consequent growth in household lending, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.5%.",
        "The member saw that, while exchange rate depreciation pressure has been weakening, the current Base Rate level, which has been unchanged now for an extended period, is showing inflation to have gradually converged on the target level, while it is also working restrictively on the real economy, such as consumption and investment.",
        "Accordingly, expectations and conditions for monetary policy easing have been gradually ripening.",
        "However, it should be accompanied by effective macroprudential policies to curb financial imbalances, such as rising housing prices and any growth in household lending.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and maintain it at 3.50%.",
        "The member commented that, as the slowdown in consumer price inflation has become apparent across major economies, pivots in monetary policy stances are coming into full swing.",
        "In the U.S., uncertainties regarding the pace of economic slowdown remain, as the market responded sensitively to the unemployment rate, which was slightly higher than projected.",
        "However, the dominant view is that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pivot is now in sight.",
        "As for the domestic economy, the member projected that even with strong exports led by semiconductors, due to the slow recovery in domestic demand the growth rate for the year will reach the level of its long-term average.",
        "With regard to employment, aggregate indicators are favorable, with the unemployment rate reaching a record low, while employment is weak in domestic demand sectors, including construction.",
        "The member forecast that consumer price inflation, if it remains on the downward path, would decline to the lower 2% level at the year-end.",
        "Given stable inflation, the slow recovery of domestic demand, and high delinquency rates among some vulnerable sectors, it seems to be the right time for gradual monetary easing.",
        "Such expectations can be also seen in the sharp decline in market rates.",
        "The member, however, expressed huge concerns about the rapid rise in real estate prices, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan region.",
        "While financial conditions are easing, rate cuts should not act as a catalyst to accelerate the rise in real estate prices.",
        "Real estate price hikes in some regions could not only intensify household debt growth and worsen wealth inequality but could also undermine the efficiency of resource allocation in the long-term.",
        "The member pointed out that interest rates have non-discriminatory effects on the economy as a whole.",
        "Negative side effects of rate cuts can be eased when accompanied by macroprudential policies curbing real estate demand.",
        "In this regard, it is necessary to monitor whether future policies have tangible results.",
        "With all these factors taken into consideration, the member believed that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% and determine future policy directions while keeping an eye on major countries’ monetary policies, the process of resolving real estate proejct financing, and developments in the housing market and in household debt.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that the global economy is expected to continue its trend of modest growth.",
        "However, uncertainties over the pace of future growth increased with growing concerns about an economic recession in the U.S.",
        "The member observed that inflation in major economies continued to slow across the board.",
        "As a result, most central banks in advanced economies began cutting rates or have signaled the possibility of doing so.",
        "Although geopolitical risks somewhat heightened in the Middle East, international oil prices generally stabilized at low levels due to the prediction of a softening in global oil demand.",
        "With regard to international financial markets, the member noted that major price variables showed significant volatility as the risk-off sentiment strengthened considerably and then reversed in response to worries about an economic recession in the U.S. and policy rate hikes in Japan.",
        "Global stocks bounced back quickly after having plunged, and government bond yields in advanced economies fell considerably on heightened expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cuts.",
        "The member stated that domestic financial and foreign exchange markets witnessed high volatility affected by changes in the global risk-off sentiment.",
        "Stock prices rebounded after having fallen steeply and long-term government bond yields dropped below 3%.",
        "The won-dollar exchange rate decreased due to the weakening of the dollar.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member observed that exports were booming, whereas the recovery in consumption had been slower than anticipated due to the monsoon season being longer than in an average year and due to a delayed improvement in income conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, the domestic economy is projected to show modest growth, as exports continue to grow and as consumption gradually recovers due to improved real incomes.",
        "However, there are high uncertainties concerning the sustainability of the strong export growth.",
        "As for inflation, the member judged that domestic inflation continued to cool.",
        "In July, consumer price inflation increased slightly owing to rises in international oil prices, but the core inflation rate remained low, at the lower 2% level, and short-term inflation expectations moved down as well.",
        "Going forward, inflation is anticipated to continue its slowing trend.",
        "The member observed that household loans in the financial sector rose at a rapid pace, driven by the increase in apartment prices and transaction volume in Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "Given that the government recently announced real estate measures to cool the market, it would be necessary to examine the policy effects, while closely monitoring household debt and housing market conditions for the time being.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that, although credit risk aversion had somewhat eased thanks to the government's real estate project financing soft landing measures, delinquency rates on loans from non-banks still remained at high levels.",
        "In summary, the member expected inflation to converge toward the target level, with the domestic economy maintaining a moderate growth trend.",
        "However, concerns about the buildup of financial imbalances have increased due to rising housing prices and expanding household loan growth.",
        "Additionally, there is still caution in foreign exchange markets due to increased volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Taking these circumstances into comprehensive consideration, the member took the view that the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level of appropriately through communication to prevent risks to financial stability from escalating.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member observed that, amid the recent modest global economic recovery, concerns about a recession in the U.S. were highlighted due to the weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
        "However, such fears had somewhat eased in line with the subsequent release of positive economic data.",
        "Given that the services industry, which accounts for a large share of the U.S. economy, remained robust, the likelihood of a sharp slowdown in U.S. economic growth was not high.",
        "Meanwhile, on the inflation front, as the disinflationary trend continued, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s burden of pivoting waned significantly.",
        "In Japan, the Bank of Japan’s rate hike triggered a significant repatriation of yen carry funds accummulated over an extended period, leading to a sharp strengthening of the yen and a significant increase in risky asset price volatility.",
        "Japan’s monetary policy emerged as a major source of uncertainty in global financial markets.",
        "In China, amid ongoing weak domestic demand and a sluggish real estate sector, the pace of its economic recovery would likely depend on the extent of practical policy support from the Chinese government after the third plenum.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy continued to show divergence, with exports booming but with domestic demand remaining sluggish.",
        "However, domestic demand is expected to improve modestly following the third quarter of 2024, with private consumption projected to gradually pick up on the back of sustained real wage growth.",
        "In the labor market, while the unemployment rate declined slightly, the growth in the number of persons employed remained lower than expected.",
        "Meanwhile, since inflation continued to slow in line with the forecasted path, it was not seen to be a constraint on rate cuts at this moment.",
        "The member observed that in global financial markets, government bond yields in major economies fell significantly in response to the dovish July FOMC meeting outcome and in response to concerns about a U.S. economic recession.",
        "Affected by this, government bond yields in the domestic financial market declined sharply as well, easing financial conditions.",
        "Moreover, overall liquidity remained quite favorable, with a continuous increase in the money supply (M2).",
        "However, delinquency rates have continued to rise driven by corporate loans from non-bank financial institutions, and risks are still lurking with regard to some construction firms and non-bank financial institutions involved in real estate project financing.",
        "Therefore, the member noted that caution was needed to ensure that financial market unrest does not materialize during the restructuring process of real estate project financing.",
        "Meanwhile, housing prices continued to gain strong growth momentum with a steady rise in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area, and home mortgage loans also rose significantly.",
        "In addition, if the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates going forward, domestic financial market conditions could ease through interest rate synchronization, further fuelling the rise in housing prices.",
        "This could increase the demand-side pressure on household debt, so it is time to pay close attention to the possibility of another large increase in household debt, the member noted.",
        "Concerning the domestic foreign exchange market, the member stated that the won-dollar exchange rate fell, affected mainly by a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY).",
        "The foreign currency money market remained generally stable.",
        "Arbitrage incentives still remained low, although there was an increase due to a stronger risk aversion in line with the emergence of concerns over a U.S. economic recession, while foreign currency borrowing spreads and CDS premiums maintained low levels as well.",
        "In consideration of the abovementioned economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, the member judged that it was appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "Whereas the pivot risk associated with inflation had decreased greatly, and the need for a pivot increased due to lagging domestic demand, the likelihood of rate cuts translating into a rise in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area had risen significantly.",
        "It would be necessary to do the best to stabilize housing prices, as excessively high housing prices relative to income levels do not only undermine financial stability, but also decrease productivity in the economy by distorting resource allocation.",
        "In light of this, the member assessed that, at this point, it was proper to make sure that monetary policy would not further spur financial market instability, and noted that it would be desirable to determine rate cuts while examining the effects of real estate measures going forward, including macroprudential policies.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that the global economy has continued its moderate growth trend, but uncertainties regarding economic conditions in major countries, such as the U.S. and China, had somewhat increased.",
        "Regarding inflation in major countries, there had been progress in disinflation, with consumer price inflation rates generally continuing to slow.",
        "In international financial markets, risk aversion had intensified significantly due to concerns about an economic slowdown stemming from worsening U.S. employment indicators, as well as to a sudden strengthening of the Japanese yen due to the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hike.",
        "However, such risk averse sentiments have been largely reversed, with key price variables showing high volatility throughout this process.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy had resumed moderate growth in the second half of the year after contracting on a preliminary basis in the second quarter due to the base effect, but that the divergence between exports and domestic demand was continuing.",
        "While exports have continued to grow at a high rate due to the strong IT industry, the recovery in private consumption has been slower than expected due to the impact of abnormally high temperatures and heavy rainfall, with the consumption of goods remaining sluggish despite an improvement in real incomes.",
        "While construction investment remains sluggish due to the impact of sluggish construction starts and orders, facilities investment has turned positive as delayed investment in capital goods, such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment and aircraft, has resumed.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed continues to grow and the unemployment rate remains low.",
        "Looking ahead, the domestic economy is expected to maintain growth above its potential level, driven by continued export growth and by a gradual recovery in consumption stemming from improvements in real incomes.",
        "However, the future growth path will likely be influenced by the recovery in consumption, the magnitude of the expansion of the IT sector, and economic conditions in major countries.",
        "As for domestic inflation, the member noted that, while core inflation had continued to slow, the overall consumer price inflation rate temporarily increased in July due to higher petroleum product prices.",
        "Given the base effect of the sharp increase in oil and agricultural product prices last year and the downward stabilization of core inflation, inflation is expected to continue its slowing trend.",
        "The future path of inflation is likely to be influenced by international oil prices and exchange rate movements, agricultural product price trends, and whether public utility fees are adjusted.",
        "In the real estate market, the volume of housing transactions is increasing, particuarly for apartments in the Seoul metropolitan area, and housing price growth is also expanding.",
        "The member took the view that, in the domestic financial market, the easing trend of financial conditions appears to have intensified, with market interest rates falling significantly and lending rates decreasing due to preemptively reflected expectations of a shift in monetary policies at home and abroad.",
        "Household loans have been increasing by about 5 trillion won per month, mainly driven by home mortgage loans, with a rise in housing transactions in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "Given the recent increase in housing transactions, it is likely that the growth in individual home mortgage loans, and in jeonse leasehold deposit loans in particular, will continue to expand for some time.",
        "However, risks related to real estate project financing remain latent, with delinquency rates on loans from non-banks staying high.",
        "In the foreign exchange market, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate dropped significantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar stemming from heightened expectations of a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but concerns remain regarding the U.S. economic slowdown, the unwinding of the yen carry trade, and geopolitical risks.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member saw it desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "Although inflation is expected to continue its slowing trend and gradually converge toward the target level, and as the recovery in domestic demand is slow, the possibility of financial imbalances growing due to rising housing prices, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area and due to expanding growth in household loans is significant, and concerns in the foreign exchange market still persist.",
        "Against this backdrop, it is necessary to carefully assess the impact of any shift in monetary policy on financial stability.",
        "At this point, it is necessary to respond with an appropriate policy mix to prevent any prolonged expansion of risks in the housing market and in household debt.",
        "Going forward, the member stated that it is necessary to closely monitor the inflation and growth trajectories in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "When determining the timing and extent of any Base Rate cut, the direction of monetary policies in major countries, movements in financial and foreign exchange markets, and the financial stability situation, including the housing market and household debt, should be taken into consideration.",
        "At the same time, more vigilance when communicating is necessary to avoid any significant divergence between policy intentions and market expectations.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that, regarding global economic conditions, as inflation gradually approaches the target level, more central banks in major countries are lowering their policy rates, and the possibility of a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve has also increased.",
        "As central banks and markets in major countries gradually shift their focus from inflation to growth, market sensitivity to real economic indicators has heightened, as seen in the sharp fluctuations in stock prices in response to indicators like U.S. employment growth.",
        "The member saw that the domestic economy has continued to grow, driven by stronger-than-expected export performance, particularly of IT products, but that the recovery in domestic demand remained sluggish.",
        "Although facilities investment has rebounded, the recovery in private consumption has been delayed as the positive momentum from strong exports has not extended to wages or employment growth, with the self-employed sector remaining weak, mainly due to structural challenges.",
        "The member stated that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate has fallen from the upper 1,300 won range to the lower 1,300 won range lately.",
        "Although uncertainties remain high, including geopolitical risks and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate is expected to continue its downward trend due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cuts.",
        "The member noted that underlying inflation indicators, including core inflation, have been stabilizing, approaching the 2% target level.",
        "While consumer prices have slightly increased, inflation expectations among the general public continue to decline.",
        "If no unexpected supply shocks occur, consumer price inflation is expected to narrow the gap with core inflation and converge toward the target level.",
        "The member took the view that domestic financial conditions have eased further, with significant declines in both short- and long-term interest rates, in credit bond yields, and in lending rates.",
        "The growth in household loans, particularly home mortgage loans, expanded further in July and is at risk of increasing faster than GDP growth.",
        "Considering the relatively accommodative macroprudential policy stance, declining household lending rates, and the possibility of continued housing supply-demand imbalances in the Seoul metropolitan area, housing prices are likely to keep rising.",
        "Consequently, the rapid increase in household debt is expected to persist for some time.",
        "The member argued that this trend could weaken household spending capacity due to the increasing debt repayment burden and threaten financial stability.",
        "It could also undermine economic dynamism by expanding the flow of funds into the real estate sector rather than into productive investments.",
        "Furthermore, it should be noted that high housing costs and asset prices relative to labor income can worsen wealth inequality, exacerbating structural problems in Korean society, such as the low birth rate and intergenerational or class conflicts.",
        "Overall, the member presented the view that, considering that inflation is approaching the 2% target in a more stable manner after having surged since the pandemic, and that the external sector, including the exchange rate, is generally settling down, but that the recovery in domestic demand, such as private consumption, is slow, conditions are being created in which it would be possible to shift to a less restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that financial conditions had eased before a shift in monetary policy, and this, combined with vulnerabilities in the real estate market, was driving up housing prices and contributing to the growth in household debt.",
        "These developments have, in turn, increased the risk of negative impacts on financial stability, on medium- and long-term growth, and on the implementation of structural reforms.",
        "This suggests that it is necessary to operate the policy rate path on a higher trajectory than it would be if only inflation and growth forecasts were considered.",
        "In this regard, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.5% at this meeting.",
        "Going forward, it is necessary to make monetary policy decisions carefully, by taking into account future economic and financial developments, the benefits and costs that Base Rate adjustments could have on domestic demand, inflation forecasts, financial stability, and the effects of the recently announced government housing and macroprudential policies."

    "2023": [
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (January 2023),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that domestic economic growth was slowing rapidly due to sluggishness in China-bound exports and IT exports, the materialization of the effects of the Base Rate hikes so far, and one-off factors, in the midst of slower global economic growth.",
        "Some members assessed that labor market conditions were showing mixed signals, with nominal wages maintaining a high uptrend, the increase in the number of persons employed slowing, and December labor market indicators worsening, particularly in the self-employed.",
        "Meanwhile, some members stated that, on the growth path, there were growing uncertainties surrounding external conditions related, for example, to the pace of recovery in the Chinese economy following its reopening.",
        "In terms of inflation, members commented that consumer price inflation registered in petroleum products, and base effects, while core inflation maintained a moderate uptrend due to a recovery in consumption and the second-round effects.",
        "Meanwhile, some members saw that there were no great upside risks, given the materialization of downward pressure on prices following Base Rate hikes on the price path, and a slowdown in the real economy.",
        "However, the member assessed that it would be too early to be optimistic that prices would show downward stability, given that consumer price inflation was running significantly above the medium-term inflation target of 2% and that underlying sources of inflationary pressures, such as the impact of hikes in public utility fees, remained.",
        "Members also assessed that domestic financial market conditions were stable, backed by market stabilization measures by the Bank of Korea and the government.",
        "The member stated that market interest rates had fallen considerably, stock prices had rebounded, and the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had decreased significantly, owing to a shift to US dollar weakening.",
        "Some members stressed the need to promote financial stablity from the medium- to long-term perspective, while paying attention to any risk of a sharp decline in housing prices undermining financial stability, and to any increase in exchange rate volatility in line with adjustments of expectations of tightening by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 3.50% from the current 3.25%, while some members argued for keeping it unchanged at the current 3.25%.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 3.50% from the current 3.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy appeared to be weakening overall.",
        "The member noted that the growth and the inflation rates in the US were slowing owing to the increases in interest rates, while Europe continued to face elevated inflation and high energy-related uncertainties, despite the fact that the margin of economic decline is expected to be smaller than the initial projection thanks to abnormal temperatures and energy alternatives.",
        "On the domestic front, the member judged that the economy has stagnated more considerably than previously expected due to a sharp drop in exports to China and in the IT sector.",
        "The member expected that for the forseeable future the economy would be influenced mainly by developments concering the reopening of the Chinese economy.",
        "The member noted that the arguments calling for additional Base Rate hikes have somewhat weakened, considering that the real economy appeared to have been slowing and that the increases in the Base Rate so far seemed to have begun to put downward pressure on prices with a time lag, as suggested by the downtrend in consumer price inflation since July last year.",
        "However, the member stressed that there is a continued need to respond to inflation by raising the Base Rate due to the following two main reasons.",
        "First, inflation risk still remains high.",
        "The member evaluated that the decline in inflation was mainly attributable to a sharp reduction in the contribution by supply-side, temporary factors, such as petroleum and agricultural & livestock products.",
        "The member also mentioned that the diffusion index has not been falling since July, while that of core items has been continuously climbing.",
        "In addition, the member commented that the contribution of industrial goods excluding petroleum products and of personal services remaining elevated indicates that the second-round effects of inflation persist.",
        "The member thus emphasized the continued need for restricting demand-side inflation.",
        "The member stated that inflation is, “taxation without legislation,” adding that there is a need to be aware of the fact that it poses greater damage to low-income households with relatively smaller size of real assets.",
        "Second was the matter of what policy should be used to respond to the inflation risk.",
        "The member assessed that, going forward, issues could arise around refinancing of low-credit bonds caused by differing credit risks, and that the health of securities and construction firms could deteriorate driven by real-estate project financing, given the recent financial turbulence that had been triggered by an unintended incident.",
        "Given the circumstances, the member saw it plausible that the argument for responding preemptively to financial imbalances might have grown stronger.",
        "However, the member underscored that, given the other tools that are at disposal to tackle financial imbalances, such as market stabilization measures of the Bank of Korea and macroprudential policies of the government, the Base Rate should be reserved for responding to inflation, which is the most critical issue of today.",
        "The member noted that other instruments of the Bank of Korea should be used when necessary concerning the Bank’s role as market maker and as lender of last resort, while the government’s macroprudential policies should be used first to manage economic agents’ leverage, risk-taking behaviors, and asset prices.",
        "The member added that the possibility of a significant widening of the gap between the policy rates of Korea and of the US causing instability in the FX market is also an area requiring consideration.",
        "The member argued that, given the international standing of the US dollar, convenience yield, and financial friction, unforeseen herding and non-linear effects could emerge in relation to the interest rate differentials between Korea and the US, exchange rate, and capital flows.",
        "The member stressed the need to operate monetary policy while paying attention to the possibility of exchange rate volatility escalating in either direction, as the expectations for policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve are adjusted and China’s reopening progresses.",
        "The member also saw the need to come up with a policy mix that seeks a soft landing of housing prices and deleveraging.",
        "The member mentioned that housing finance in Korea is characterized by a high share of high credit borrowers, but with the vulnerability of a high share of variable rate loans.",
        "The member added that the household debt ratio stands very high, as there has been no deleveraging process since the past crisis.",
        "The member noted that the household debt ratio has been inching down recently, affected by interest rate rises and a sluggish housing market, but added that the ratio still remains relatively high compared to other major countries.",
        "The member stressed the importance of inducing gradual deleveraging of households in the medium to long-term, with a view to promoting financial stability and enabling capital to be used in a way that benefits the national economy.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.50% from the current 3.25% at this meeting.",
        "Looking at recent external economic conditions, the member stated that global inflation was slowing somewhat thanks to the subsidized surge in international oil prices, and demand had become more sluggish, affected by strong tightening, but the relevant conditions varied from country to country.",
        "The member stated that, in the US, consumption and production both had weakened, but labor market conditions were showing favorable movements.",
        "The member noted that the euro area saw its sluggish growth trend deepen due to disruptions in energy supply.",
        "Japan was sustaining a relatively favorable growth trend thanks to the impact of government support measures, and China was highly likely to rebound early after the second quarter thanks to excessive savings.",
        "The member judged that downturns in economic activity and employment were continuing in Korea, with sluggishness in both exports and domestic demand having deepened after the fourth quarter last year, and with labor market indicators, and those in the self-employed in particular, having worsened in December.",
        "The member expected the economic growth to recover, bolstered by improvements in external conditions, led by China, after the middle of this year.",
        "However, the member forecast that decreases in consumption and investment capacity following the growth in debt so far, the scarring effect caused by the pandemic, and delays in restructuring, and the possible prolongation of the slumping real estate market, would all weigh on the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "The member saw that consumer price inflation in Korea slowed to 5% after November last year, due to a weakening of both supply-side and demand-side inflationary pressures in the midst of somewhat slower growth in global inflation.",
        "The member forecast that consumer price inflation would continue to slow to around 4% in the first half of this year, and to around 3% in the second half.",
        "The member took the view that upside risks did not appear to be large on the future price path, given that supply and demand pressures had weakened due mainly to a decline in international oil prices and slower domestic demand, as well as to worsened labor and housing market conditions.",
        "The member estimated that wage growth was highly likely to have weakened, given recent weaker labor market indicators and lower inflation expectations, and that price inflation related to shelter was slowing more rapidly in Korea compared to major countries due mainly to reductions in leasehold deposits and monthly rents.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that a close eye should still be kept on prices, given that the pace of decline in inflation was moderate, that there would be a high chance of additional hikes in electricity fees and the resultant second-round effects on prices, and that international oil prices could pick up again in line with a rebound in the Chinese economy.",
        "The member stated that, in the financial and foreign exchange markets, instability across the entire market had eased with market interest rates and credit spreads falling and with the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate decreasing significantly thanks to market stabilization measures by the Bank of Korea and the government, and adjustments to the pace of rate hikes in major countries.",
        "However, the member took the view that there still remained credit risk aversion toward real estate-related money markets, and both capital flow and exchange rate volatility could heighten again following shrinking global liquidity and increased differentials between domestic and foreign interest rates.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member stated that, while our economy was seeing sluggishness in both exports and domestic demand due to weaker domestic and overseas conditions, it would be necessary to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points and maintain a tightening stance, given that price inflation still remained high despite a recent slowing, that a liqudity crunch in the domestic financial market had been alleviated, and that tightening in the US and other major countries was ongoing.",
        "However, the member stated that, in terms of Base Rate operations going forward, if price inflation continued to show slowing movements following the current forecast, whether to additionally raise the Base Rate should be decided cautiously in consideration of economic sluggishness in line with rising real interest rates, and burdens that could appear on the financial stability risk side.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to On the domestic economic front, the member stated that economic growth was slowing more rapidly than initially projected.",
        "The member noted that, while facilities investment continued to recover, exports remained sluggish due mainly to a slowing global economy, and that the recovery trend in private consumption had also slowed, though the member added that labor market conditions remained strong.",
        "The member projected that the domestic economy would maintain these movements for some time and show lower-than-expected growth.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that there was a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding the future growth path, given the great changes in COVID-19 restrictions and economic policy measures in China in the midst of rapid changes in recent global financial conditions.",
        "In terms of inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation had been showing a downward trend against the backdrop of base effects and a slower increase in petroleum product prices after July last year, and, of late, partially due to impacts from rate hikes.",
        "Nonetheless, the member took the view that consumer price inflation was still running significantly above the inflation target, as a larger increase in processed food prices and the impact of hikes in electricity and gas fees were putting upward pressure.",
        "The member presented the opinion that it would be still too early to be optimistic about any downward stabilization of prices going forward, given the underlying sources of inflationary pressures, such as core and service inflation, the hikes in public utility fees, and possible rises in commodity prices.",
        "Looking at financial market conditions, the member commented that markets had stabilized, with market interest rates falling significantly and stock prices rebounding since the beginning of this year.",
        "The member added that the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, which had been working to destabilize financial markets last year, fell significantly owing to a shift to US dollar weakening, and short-term money and credit bond market crunches had been alleviated considerably, bolstered by improvements in global financial conditions and market stabilization measures.",
        "However, the member saw that the recent improvements in investor sentiment in global financial markets were greatly diverging from the tightening monetary policy stances in major countries, including the US, and took the view that attention should be paid to the point that instability in the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets could recur in the process of policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks.",
        "The member stated that credit risk aversion related to real estate financing and non-prime bonds still existed as destabilizing factors, particularly as housing prices continued to decline since last year.",
        "The member added that a steep fall in housing prices, as seen recently, could negatively affect financial markets and the macroeconomy as a whole, but that such a correction process had been somewhat unavoidable in that housing prices had risen excessively over the past few years, and financial imbalances, as exemplified by accumulated household debt, had widened.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to work to resolve the accumulated imblances in the real estate sector and household debt, while at the same time preventing the recent decline in housing prices from undermining financial stability.",
        "The member judged that it would be appropriate to decide whether to additionally raise the Base Rate depending on future growth and inflation trends, the degree of monetary tightening by major countries, and in view of the impacts of the rate increases so far.",
        "The member took the view that, going forward, monetary policy should be focused on converging high inflation to the target level going forward.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to run below the potential growth rate for some time due to the slower growth trend, but saw a need to tolerate slower short-term growth to bring the current high and persistent inflation down to the target level.",
        "The member presented the opinion that it would be important to firmly anchor a tighter policy stance until an inflation trend that converged to the target could be clearly shown, in order for the macroeconomy to regain the foundation for stable growth.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 3.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had been slowing significantly due to the spread of COVID-19 in China and the contraction of the IT industry, and that this trend would last until the first half of this year at the earliest.",
        "The member took the view that the sluggishness in the global economy could ease somewhat toward the second half of the year, boosted by the normalization of China’s economic activity and improvements in the IT industry, but that it would not be easy to expect any rapid economic recovery due to the spillover effects of the short-term surge in interest rates on the financial sector and the real economy.",
        "The member noted that a domestic economic slowdown had become evident since the fourth quarter last year.",
        "The member stated that the sluggishness of exports had worsened, owing to slowed external demand, and that private consumption had shown much slower growth affected by weakening real purchasing power and higher debt repayment burdens, and went on to forecast that such trends would continue for a considerable period of time this year.",
        "The member assessed that a slowdown in housing market activity would dampen both consumption and investment, and that it would be difficult this year to expect fiscal expenditure, which had helped ease the economic contraction so far, to support growth.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had declined since the second half of last year, with supply-side upward pressures easing due chiefly to the decrease in oil prices, and that core inflation, after modest growth for some time led by the consumption recovery and the second-round effects, had recently started to exhibit slower growth.",
        "Looking at employment, the member expressed the opinion that the seasonally adjusted number of persons employed had declined for the fourth consecutive month, and that the job vacancy rate had reversed to a decrease recently, suggesting that it was difficult to expect employment indicators to improve amid the overall economic slowdown.",
        "The member stated that, while monetary tightening over the past year and a half started to take evident effect, transactions in the housing and other asset markets had contracted drastically, as these markets remained sluggish, and growth in credit to the private sector had been slowing gradually.",
        "The member presented the view that the possibility of a decrease in real monetary aggregates with inflation taken into account could not be dismissed, given the recent rapid slowdown in M2 growth.",
        "The member added that this suggested that we had passed the stage where vigilance against further inflationary pressure on the demand side was required.",
        "The member, meanwhile, assessed that there was no significant difference between Treasury bond yields and the Base Rate, reflecting that the outlook for growth was never optimistic.",
        "Taking the above discussions into overall consideration, the member saw that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting for the following two reasons.",
        "First, further tightening could be considered necessary in order to stabilize inflation quickly at the target level, but the benefits seemed to be very small or uncertain considering the current policy and market rates.",
        "More specifically, since the terminal Base Rate was expected to continue for a considerable period of time, attention should be paid to the possibility of an excessive contraction of economic vitality.",
        "Second, it might be of concern that further tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve could widen the spread between the U.S. and Korean policy rates.",
        "However, a widening of the policy rate spread does not have to be linked directly to FX sector instability, since the impacts of interest rate differentials on exchange rates and capital flows could vary depending on factors specific to individual countries, such as growth gaps between countries, financial conditions of individual countries, and movements of the value of the US dollar relative to major currencies.",
        "as well as on common factors shared among countries and their outlooks.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 3.50% from the current 3.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that major central banks were likely to maintain their monetary tightening stance although global inflation had peaked and growth outlooks had been adjusted downward.",
        "The member judged that this was because the labor market had not slowed enough to substantially curb interaction between personal service charges and wage growth, and also because it remained uncertain whether countries would see inflation converge to target levels in the short-term.",
        "As for China, the member expected that the earlier-than-expected easing of “zero COVID” restrictions would likely have a substantial impact on the contraction in production and consumption in the short-term, but that demand was likely to show a full-fledged recovery, probably from the second quarter, boosted by the achievement of herd immunity and accumulated household savings.",
        "The member assessed that the impact of China’s demand recovery on the global economy and inflation would depend on developments of goods and services consumption and on movements of global commodity prices.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member forecast that the growth rate would fall short of the mid-1% level this year, with external demand slowing to a much greater extent than originally expected, and with previous rate hikes starting to take clear effect.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member expected that inflation would come in at the mid-3% level this year, affected by a rise in electricity fees and a reduction in fuel tax cuts.",
        "The member also presented the view that substantial inflationary pressure seemed to remain, considering the hikes in public utility fees and their spillover effects, and the possible interaction between personal service charges and wage growth.",
        "The member mentioned that the slowdown in the momentum of private consumption during the fourth quarter last year had been due to the slower growth in private consumption owing to the weakening of household purchasing power in line with interest rate hikes, and that it was also affected temporarily by the contraction in consumer sentiment following the Itaewon disaster.",
        "The member added that facilities investment had maintained its recovery, led by semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and that construction investment had also continued to improve.",
        "The member assessed that exports would remain sluggish until the second half of this year when the semiconductor industry and demand from China were expected to improve.",
        "As for employment conditions, the member noted that the number of persons employed had continued to rise, but that the pace of growth had been slowing gradually.",
        "The member mentioned that financial market stress had eased and that the markets had stabilized.",
        "The member stated that credit differentiation and wariness about credit bonds would persist due to ongoing debt repayment and risk repricing in line with interest rate hikes, but that this had been already forecast during the rate hikes.",
        "The member noted that the won-dollar exchange rate had also declined to the mid-1,200 won level since U.S. inflation had slowed.",
        "The member assessed that, in overall consideration of these domestic and international economic environments, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to was because inflation remained well above its target (2%), although it was expected to decline gradually, and also because it was necessary to induce inflation convergence toward the target in the shortest possible time, out of concern about uncertainties surrounding inflation persistence.",
        "The member added that financial market conditions had stabilized compared to the time of the November meeting, and that a 25bp hike was unlikely to undermine financial stability significantly considering the flow of funds in the market.",
        "The member stated that future monetary policy decisions should be made in comprehensive consideration of financial and FX market conditions, growth and inflation forecasts, and monetary policy developments in major countries.",
        "The member noted that the central bank should maintain its monetary tightening stance until it was confident that inflation would converge close to the target soon, and should consider further rate hikes if needed.",
        "The member also presented the view that maintaining the monetary tightening stance long enough would help facilitate the deleveraging of household debt that had increased excessively, and strengthen the long-term soundness of the Korean economy.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current 3.25%.",
        "The member mentioned that the global economy had remained in a slump and that uncertainties over the growth path had increased to some extent, amid growing pressure from steep policy rate hikes and persistently high inflation.",
        "The member saw that in the U.S., perceptions of the future policy rate path had significantly diverged between the Fed and the markets, and that China had seen greater uncertainties regarding its reopening due to the surge in COVID-19 cases after the lifting of restrictions.",
        "The member predicted that major economies would likely slow down at a faster rate for the time being, and that their pace of slowing would differ after the second half depending on their respective conditions.",
        "The member assessed that domestic economic growth also had slowed rapidly, affected by overseas conditions, as well as by monetary policy tightening that had been sustained for over a year.",
        "The member mentioned that the Manufacturing Production Index and the Service Industry Activity Index were estimated to have declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven mainly by the slump in the IT sector, while consumption also fell modestly.",
        "The member noted that although the size of net financial assets among households, indicating their additional consumption capacity, was still high relative to that of 2019, it had been on the decline after reaching a peak in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "The member expected that consumption would continue to slow, weighed down by an economic slowdown, declining real purchasing power, and the growing burden of loan principal and interest repayment, in addition to the decrease in consumption capacity.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member noted that both consumer price inflation and core inflation were maintaining their high rates of increase, but that they were forecast to fall to the lower-3% and to the lower-2% range, respectively, by the end of this year driven by growing downward pressure on the economy.",
        "Concerning employment, the member presented the view that the growth in the number of persons employed had slowed, and that the rate of increase in regular wages had seemingly begun to moderate.",
        "As for financial markets, the member mentioned that credit risk aversion had eased to some extent since November, with short-term market interest rates declining moderately and spreads narrowing, but that the excessive accumulation in private credit indicated a greater risk to financial stability than in other countries.",
        "The member added that amid high uncertainties over domestic and overseas conditions it was necessary to closely watch the likelihood of credit risk increasing in some sectors and ratings being driven by the economic slowdown and real estate price falls.",
        "Taking these domestic and overseas developments into consideration, the member cited the following as the major reasons for the judgment that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged.",
        "First, the Base Rate hikes delivered so far have already begun to have an effect on the real economy, and the current level of the Rate was fairly tight, given the likelihood of the economy slowing further than the earlier forecast.",
        "Second, inflation, which had been the main reason for the tightening stance, has begun to climb down moderately, likely to approach the target level after next year.",
        "Third, in terms of financial stability, the accumulation in private credit and the pace of real estate price corrections have remained a risk factor in financial markets.",
        "Fourth, the impact of interest rate differentials on the foreign exchange supply and demand have not been much of a source of concern, given that exchange rate volatility has been far greater than the interest rate differentials.",
        "Finally, the member presented the view that it would be appropriate to make a decision on any additional tightening only after monitoring the effectiveness of the tigtening, the real economic trends, and overseas conditions.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Joo Sangyong and Dr. Shin Sung Hwan expressed clear opposition to raising the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points, and argued for keeping it at the current level.",
        "Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.25% to 3.50%.",
        "The Board judges that the additional high and is projected to be above the target level for a considerable time, although the domestic economic growth rate is expected to be below the November forecast.",
        "□ Currently available information suggests that the global economic slowdown has continued, affected by ongoing high inflation and the resultant policy rate hikes in major countries, although inflation is starting to slow due to the decline in global oil prices.",
        "In global financial markets, the US dollar has continued to weaken due to the adjustment to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes and prospects of strengthening monetary tightening, such as at the European Central Bank.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pace of global inflation slowdown, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, developments in the Chinese economy after the easing of its COVID-19 restriction policies, and geopolitical risks.",
        "□ Domestic economic growth has continued to slow with exports decreasing significantly and the recovery in private consumption weakening.",
        "Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to the economic slowdown.",
        "Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to weaken, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates, and GDP growth for this year will be below the November forecast of 1.7%.",
        "As for the economic outlook, uncertainties regarding the pace of recovery in the Chinese economy and an economic slowdown in major countries are both judged to be high.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation has remained high at 5.0% in December driven by accelerating price increases in processed food products, with the continuing effects of electricity and gas fee hikes, although increases in the price of petroleum products have moderated.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has fallen slightly to within the lower-4% range, and short-term inflation expectations of the general public have slowed to the upper-3% range, but they have continued to stay high.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain around 5% in January and February, but will gradually decrease due to the base effect and weakening pressures from the demand side.",
        "Consumer price inflation for this year is expected to be generally consistent with the November forecast of 3.6%.",
        "Uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high, regarding the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, the size of the increases in electricity and gas fees and public utility fees, and movements of global oil prices and exchange rates.",
        "□ In financial and foreign exchange markets, unrest has been eased by market stabilization measures and adjustments to the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate hikes.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have fallen, spreads on corporate bonds and commercial paper have narrowed, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has decreased significantly.",
        "However, high credit risk aversion is continuing among non-prime bonds and project financing asset-backed commercial paper (PF-ABCP).",
        "Household loans have continued to decrease, and the decline in housing prices has widened significantly across all parts of the country.",
        "□ The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board deems it warranted to maintain the restrictive policy stance with an emphasis on ensuring price stability, as inflation is expected to remain high above the target level, although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed.",
        "Meanwhile, the Board will judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while thoroughly assessing the economic downside risks and financial stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, the pace of inflation slowdown, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (February 2023),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.",
        "Members assessed that despite eased concern about a global recession, domestic economic growth continued to slow due to a slump in exports driven by a severe contraction in the IT business and to weakened momentum for private consumption caused by the increase in the household debt servicing burden.",
        "Meanwhile, some members stated that while the economy was expected to recover gradually some time in the second half of this year as the slump in exports eases in line with the improvement in the overseas economic environment, uncertainties still remained over the growth path surrounding external conditions, such as conditions in the semiconductor business and the recovery in China.",
        "In terms of inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the lower-5% level during January, driven by an increase in processed food prices and hikes in public utility fees.",
        "However, they predicted consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding food and energy to slow gradually this year to 3.50% and 3.0%, respectively, led mainly by declines in petroleum product prices, the base effect, and weakening demand pressure going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, some members assessed that there were still some upside risks to inflation, given the continued rise in core inflation, the second-round effects of non-core on core inflation, and economic recoveries at home and abroad.",
        "Members also assessed that domestic financial market conditions had remained stable with risk aversion weakened in general, though they were somewhat accommodative given the tigthening stance.",
        "Meanwhile, some members stressed that, concerning the financial stability, attention must be paid to the risk to overall financial market stability arising from a sharp leverage adjustment in the process of easing financial imbalances, as well as to the differentiation in risks across credit ratings.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environment, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period, while one member argued for raising it by 25 basis points.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member projected that the global economy would recover gradually after bottoming out in the first quarter, backed by favorable employment conditions in the US, the easing of the energy crisis in Europe, and the reopening in China, although sluggish demand had been ongoing since the second half of last year.",
        "The member saw that exports would likely improve gradually as external conditions surrounding our economy improve.",
        "However, the member anticipated that the growth rate for this year would run at the mid-1% level due to sluggish domestic demand stemming, for instance, from decreases in consumption and investment capacity following an increased debt burden.",
        "The member saw that inflation rose again to 5.2% in January, affected by rises in public utility fees, but expected price inflation for this year to run somewhat below the previous forecast, influenced by a decline in international oil prices and sluggish domestic demand.",
        "The member projected that the uptrend in prices would weaken steadily to 4% in the first half of this year and to around 3% in the second half, influenced by the easing of demand-side inflationary pressures and the base effect on the supply side.",
        "The member saw that core inflation would fall to the lower-2% level at the year-end, from the current lower-4% level.",
        "The member forecast that core goods inflation would slow, as a decline in import prices would be reflected after a time gap, and upward pressure on core service inflation would weaken further, influenced by a sluggish housing market and households’ increased debt servicing burdens in line with rate hikes.",
        "The member stated that, contrary to the US, which saw heightened upward pressure on wages and prices, particularly in the service sector, due to reduced labor supply, Korea witnessed an ongoing increase in the involuntary labor supply of the elderly, which was acting as an underlying downside factor for service prices.",
        "The member thus saw the need to pay attention to this point.",
        "The member commented that, in the financial markets, long-term market interest rates rose again and the Korean won shifted to depreciation again as US Treasury yields rose and the US dollar strengthened again due to expectations of a higher level of the terminal federal funds rate in the US.",
        "The member presented the view that, although funding conditions in the market and foreign currency liquidity remained relatively favorable, the number of potential risks did not appear to be small, with the delinquency rate for financial institutions rising, associated in particular with lending to the real estate sector, and the credit spread on low-rated bonds remaining high.",
        "The member stated that, in the midst of a sustained decline in housing prices, deleveraging of household debt was ongoing, as housing-related loans at financial institutions shifted to a decline for the first time in 10 years.",
        "The member judged that, in view of the changes in economic conditions, the effects of the rate hikes so far appeared to be shown across the entire economy, including in growth, prices, and finance, and expressed the opinion that these effects could amplify in the future, given that interest rate policy would be transmitted to the economy after a time lag of several quarters.",
        "The member judged that it would be possible to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level at this meeting, while assessing the effects of the rate hikes so far and examining future developments in domestic and overseas economic conditions, particularly since the recovery of domestic economic growth and a slowdown in inflation were projected to strengthen toward the second half of this year.",
        "However, the member stressed that keeping the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting would not necessarily mean an easing of the monetary policy tightening stance, and that the Board would put a priority on price stability in future Base Rate operations.",
        "The member projected that inflation would continue to slow moderately, but that it would still be necessary to keep a close eye on it, given the spread of inflation expectations, the second round of spillover effects from increases in public utility fees, and the prospect of a resurgence in international oil prices and in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that, if the rate differentials between Korea and the US widened further than expected due to any further rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, there could be possibility of heavier depreciation pressure on the won, which could act as a negative factor on domestic prices and growth.",
        "The member thus saw the need to take active policy measures to deal with this issue.",
        "Accordingly, the member argued that the Board should leave open the possibility of a further rate hike, while examining developments of domestic and international economic conditions, and prices in particular, going forward.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that, although the domestic economy was showing weaker growth, the trend of growth was more robust than feared.",
        "The member stated that exports had been sluggish, affected by a global economic slowdown, and the momentum of private consumption had also weakened lately, while facilities investment had maintained its trend of improvement.",
        "Concerning employment conditions, the member added that, with the number of persons employed showing a larger increase compared to past years, and labor supply and demand conditions remaining tight, wages were maintaining a high uptrend.",
        "The member projected that, while the domestic economy would maintain a slowing trend for some time, it would gradually recover in the second half of this year.",
        "The member expected that, given the earlier-than-expected reopening and economic stimulus measures in China, and stronger-than-expected economic conditions in the US and Europe, external economic conditions would improve from what was witnessed at the previous meeting.",
        "The member commented that, taking this into account, the Research Department of the Bank of Korea projected that the domestic economy would grow at its potential level after the second half while revising slightly downward the growth outlook for the first half of this year.",
        "However, the member presented the view that, since there were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path, associated with a recovery in the Chinese economy, the pace of monetary tightening in major economies, and the degree of the slump in the domestic housing market, it would be necessary to exercise caution concerning the relevant downside risks.",
        "The member stated that, with respect to prices, as consumer price inflation had risen to the lower-5% range in January, the ongoing decline trend in the inflation rate since July last year has slowed.",
        "The member added that, while an uptrend in petroleum product prices slowed, sharp price rises in processed food and personal services continued, and the effects of increases in electricity fees created upward pressure on prices.",
        "The member projected that the rise in consumer price would be decelerated for some time, given the base effect from the steep rise in the first half of last year.",
        "However, the member judged that it would be difficult to say with confidence that underlying inflation had stabilized downward, as core inflation remained elevated, led by highly persistent personal service charges, inflation expectations became unstable again, and a rise in international commodity prices stemming from the resumption of economic activity in China, hikes in public utility fees, and the relevant second-round spillover effects would highly likely to serve as factors making for price instability going forward.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member stated that, in the domestic and international financial markets, interest rates tumbled, stock prices soared, and the US dollar weakened substantially on the back of spreading expectations of an earlier-than-expected ending of monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve since the end of last year.",
        "The member commented that such a strong financial market partially arises from the resolution of excessive stress conditions stemming from the faster pace of tightening by the US Federal Reserve in the second half of last year, but it was greatly diverging from tightening monetary policy stances at home and abroad.",
        "The member thus saw that a sustained strong financial market could undermine the downward stabilization of inflation.",
        "From the perspective of financial stability, the member assessed that liquidity indicators, including M2, continued to contract due to a decline in household lending in the midst of a continued downward trend in housing prices.",
        "The member saw that a trend of decline in credit supply would likely continue going forward due to more cautious lending attitudes at financial institutions in the midst of ongoing credit risk aversion toward the real estate sector and non-investment grade companies.",
        "The member went on to assert that an excessively fast pace of these leverage adjustments could cause instability across the entire financial market and thus it would be necessary to keep a close watch on relevant developments.",
        "Concerning future monetary policy, the member stated that, in overall consideration of these points, it would be necessary to firmly anchor a tighter policy stance with an emphasis on ensuring price stability until the Board was confident that the inflation trend had converged to the target.",
        "The member stressed that if the downward stabilization of inflation did not materialize, the Board should actively deal with inflation by additionally hiking the Base Rate.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economic slowdown had become evident since the fourth quarter last year due to the contraction in the IT industry and the monetary tightening of major countries, and argued that this trend would continue at least until the first half of the year.",
        "The member mentioned that toward the second half of the year, however, the economy would recover gradually, boosted by China’s reopening, a recovery in the IT industry, and a slowdown in supply-side inflation.",
        "The member forecast that services trade might recover sooner than expected, led by China’s resumption of overseas travel, while goods trade would remain sluggish for the time being, affected by the overall economic slowdown.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the domestic economy had also remained sluggish since the fourth quarter last year, influenced by the global trade slowdown.",
        "The member noted that semiconductor production and exports had recently declined significantly and that the manufacturing sector excluding semiconductors had also been sluggish owing to slowing external demand.",
        "The member mentioned that facilities investment would shrink due to external uncertainties and that construction investment would remain sluggish affected by a slowdown in the housing market and a reduction in the SOC budget.",
        "The member expressed concern that private consumption growth had been slowing due to a growing debt repayment burden and a slowdown in the housing market.",
        "The member presented the view that it would be difficult to expect private consumption to drive growth since, despite an accumulation of excess savings during the pandemic, incentives for precautionary savings amid economic uncertainties were highly likely to limit consumption growth, and overall leverage adjustments had been underway.",
        "Concerning consumer price inflation, the member noted that uncertainties remained with regard to the pace of future slowdown, but there was a lack of grounds to support the view that demand-side pressures would decelerate the pace of slowdown given the current sluggish real economic trend and tight financial conditions.",
        "The member added that, with all other factors held constant, consumer price inflation(year-on-year) would fall to the 4% level in March, affected heavily by the base-period effect from last year’s surge in international oil prices, which could trigger a decline in inflation expectations.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that weaker demand-side inflationary pressure and lower inflation expectations would lead to a fall in actual inflation.",
        "The member assessed that monetary tightening had started to take evident effect, given the continued decline in housing prices, slower household credit growth, sluggish real investment, and a slowdown in employment and wage growth.",
        "The member stated that further tightening might be considered to stabilize inflation at the target level quickly, but given the 300 basis point Base Rate hike over the past year and a half, additional benefits would be very small or uncertain at this stage, and went on to stress that attention should be paid rather to the possibility of excessively dampening the economic recovery or increasing risks to financial stability.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to bear in mind that distribution indicators had worsened over the course of overcoming previous foreign exchange and financial crises.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that although global economic growth was somewhat slowing, the degree was more moderate than initially expected.",
        "The member assessed that in the U.S. employment conditions remained solid and that even though the rate of increase in inflation has started to decline, the pace appeared to be slowing more than anticipated.",
        "Accordingly, there was a higher chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle would be lengthened and the terminal rate would exceed the previous forecast, the member added.",
        "The member expected the euro area to witness a somewhat modest slowdown in real economic growth thanks to the easing of energy supply disruptions.",
        "The member presented the view that China’s economy was expected to recover modestly on the back of its reopening as the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, but uncertainties surrounding the extent of recovery were high.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member stated that the slowdown in growth continued as a trend, affected by external conditions and interest rate hikes, but some indicators were showing a slight upturn this year.",
        "The member said that the domestic economy would be sluggish in the first half owing to domestic and overseas conditions, such as the global economic slowdown and rising interest rates, but would recover gradually as the slump in exports ease after the second half, and that the Research Department forecast the economy to grow 1.6%, falling slightly below the November projection (1.7%).",
        "However, the member assessed that the timing and pace of the recovery were highly uncertain, depending on the recovery trajectory of the semiconductor industry and the degree of impact of China’s reopening.",
        "Turning to inflation, the member evaluated that while consumer price inflation and core inflation both remained elevated, inflation was projected to abate gradually in line with downward pressure on economic activity, but uncertainties over the future path were heightened, as inflation(month-on-month) in January was greater than the previous month.",
        "In addition, the member assessed that we can’t afford to be complacent, as developments in global energy prices related to China’s reopening and the rise in public utility bills could work as restraints on the downward stabilization of consumer price inflation.",
        "With regard to employment, the member noted that amid the decline in the growth of the number of persons employed, the rate of increase in fixed wages remained high and there were no signs of decreases.",
        "The member assessed that as risk aversion eased, financial markets remained stable with short-term interest rates falling and corporate credit spreads narrowing.",
        "As for household debt, the member stated that as the decline in household debt has continued since last year, the leverage that had been excessive has seemingly begun undergoing corrections.",
        "The member noted, however, that a sharp correction in housing prices amid rising delinquencies in loans to the real estate sector could lead to an increase in credit risks and to financial market instability.",
        "The member therefore said that caution is needed.",
        "The member added that it was hard to rule out the possiblity of additional falls in housing sales prices, given that leasehold _(jeonse) deposit prices were declining faster_ than sales prices, and that the ratio of leasehold deposit prices to sales prices tends to rise during slumps in the real estate market.",
        "The member presented the view that Korean won to US dollar exchange rate volatility expanded somewhat in the foreign exchange market, but the foreign currency money market in Korea has been generally stable until now.",
        "Considering the above mentioned economic conditions at home and abroad, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting and monitor the effects of the previous tightening on the real economy and inflation.",
        "The member expected that the effects of the widening of interest rate differentials caused by further tightening in major economies on the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate would be limited.",
        "The member expressed the view that it would be desirable to decide whether to raise the Base Rate further by examining the future inflation and growth trend and financial market conditions.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that, after being raised by 300 basis points on 10 occasions, the Base Rate has for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis reached a tight level that exceeds the estimated range of the nominal neutral rate.",
        "The member thus judged the current stage as a time to first examine the transmission of monetary policy and monitor developments concerning uncertainties around inflation and external and internal factors, before considering the need for further rate increases.",
        "The member assessed that the rate increases have been producing effects that are generally in line with the policy intentions, with prominent effects identified in financial markets and effects seen in the real economy, as well.",
        "The member added that a contraction in market liquidity is easing financial imbalances, represented by a housing market bubble and excessive leverage.",
        "Given, however, that the financial conditions index posted its highest figure during the current rate increase cycle compared to other increase cycles since 2000, the member saw that some of the conditions that are emerging in the process of monetary tightening calls for the need to pay attention to a decline in the real economy and to any instability in the financial sector.",
        "The member stated that the average capacity utilization gap in the manufacturing sector has been exhibiting negative figures since mid-2022, while the margin of growth in the number of employed persons began narrowing.",
        "The member also added that the pace of recovery in private consumption has been slowing due to an aggravating burden for households to make principal and interest repayments, while inflation appears to have been slowing, as well.",
        "With respect to financial instability, the member viewed that the drivers of market disruptions have been significantly addressed thanks to the policy interventions made by the government and the Bank of Korea in October last year, but with seemingly differentiation by credit rating.",
        "Low-credit PF-ABCP borrowers continue to struggle with financing, while loan delinquency has been occuring mainly in the non-metropolitan area, in the real estate sector and among mid- to low-credit borrowers.",
        "The member suggested the need to monitor the situation surrounding financial stability, while paying attention to the channels through which financial conditions and regional factors, which differ depending on credit rating and exposure, could trigger a systemic risk.",
        "The member stressed the importance of keeping in mind that the recent financial and economic conditions have factors that could either amplify or curtail the effects of a tight monetary policy relative to average levels in the past.",
        "The member commented that an important variable in relation to the decision whether or not to further raise the Base Rate was inflation.",
        "The member stated that, although consumer price inflation and core inflation rates are projected to stand at 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively, this year, uncertainties surrounding the inflation path are very high in terms of the degree of economic recovery at home and abroad, international oil prices, and exchange rates.",
        "The member thus saw the need to pay close attention to developments concerning core inflation for the time being due to the following two reasons.",
        "First, the member stated that the role of core inflation would be important in order for consumer price inflation to diminish in the future.",
        "Consumer price inflation consists of non-core components, such as energy and food, and of core components.",
        "The member saw that non-core component prices are not likely to exhibit a sharp drop going forward, considering geopolitical conflicts, the recovery in global demand, and the possible rise in production costs due to fragmentation.",
        "The member thus argued that only when core inflation declines would the possibility of meeting the medium-term inflation target heighten.",
        "Second, the member noted that there is a possibility of non-core inflation transmitting to core inflation, as the rise in international oil prices and public fees are reflected in the prices of other goods and services.",
        "The member saw that the recent inflation in private services being significantly high relative to labor market tightness round transmission effect.",
        "The member added that the diffusion index of core components and the trimmed-mean inflation rate are also showing signs of core inflation either rising or persisting for a longer period than previously expected.",
        "The member mentioned the need to respond with monetary policy if core inflation, which primarily reflects demand side factors, does not either turn around or appears to be highly likely to persist, due, for example, to second round transmission effects.",
        "The member added the need to closely monitor exchange rate developments that follow changes in surrounding conditions, including the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member stated that, although the interest rate differentials between Korea and the US do not work mechanically, it could induce rapid changes in market expectations in tandem with developments in the current account balance and the flows of foreign investment funds.",
        "The member thus stressed that, under the circumstances that Korea is facing, it is important to remain cautious of the possibility of exchange rate volatility affecting inflation and financial stability.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate at this meeting by 25 basis points to 3.75% from the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had continued to decelerate, but had been showing a more favorable trend than originally expected.",
        "The member forecast GDP growth for this year at 1.6%, somewhat higher than the level forecast at the January meeting.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member mentioned that inflation was likely to slow substantially from March onward due to the base-period effect from last year’s spike in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.",
        "The member forecast that the slowdown would be gradual toward the second half of the year, however, affected by hikes in public utility charges and their spillover effects, as well as downward rigidity of personal services charges.",
        "The member also presented the view that on the forecast path existed substantial uncertainties, including the impacts of a rebound in Chinese demand on oil and other import prices.",
        "The member added that inflation expectations among the general public also remained high, rising slightly to 4.0%.",
        "The member assessed that financial market conditions appeared to be accommodative given the previous tightening measures by the Bank of Korea.",
        "The member noted that, looking at proxy rates, estimated by reflecting overall financial market conditions in the policy rate through movements of price variables, such as market and lending rates, the proxy Fed funds rate recently stood at around 6%, far above the U.S. policy rate, while Korea’s proxy rate had dropped rapidly since November last year to fall below the current Base Rate.",
        "The member stated that household debt had been declining, led by credit loans, while corporate debt maintained strong growth on the back of increased lending by financial institutions and a recovery of demand in the bond market.",
        "The member added that the won-dollar exchage rate had rapidly increased recently, as expectations of future U.S. monetary policy had been adjusted.",
        "The member noted that the Bank of Korea had been raising its Base Rate to the level slightly above the range of neutral interest rate estimates to tackle last year’s spike in inflation.",
        "The member argued that the following should be considered at this month’s meeting.",
        "First, financial markets had formed more accommodative expectations than the Bank of Korea had intended with its policy measures, which was already reflected in the current financial market conditions.",
        "Second, although inflation is expected to decline gradually, there is high uncertainty surrounding the current inflation path, owing to the potential impact of China’s economic recovery, and the central bank should respond to this conservatively — it should raise the Base Rate to a level somewhat higher than the estimated level of the Base Rate corresponding to the path of consumer price inflation, which is forecast to decline to the lower 3% level until the end of this year and to the possibility of the inflation path being disturbed by the current uncertainty associated with it, which could prolong high inflation, and would also help to anchor inflation sooner at the target level.",
        "Third, it is necessary to prepare for how future foreign exchange flows and the stability of exchange rates will be affected by the recently adjusted market expectations of how high the federal funds rate will go and for how long they will stay there.",
        "Taking the above discussions into overall consideration, the member saw that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points at this meeting to cause the economy to contract somewhat, but only to a tolerable extent thanks to the improvement in external conditions.",
        "The member went on to argue that the rate hike this time could support sustainable deleveraging of household debt and, above all, help cope aggressively with the current uncertainty surrounding the path of price stability, the top priority for the central bank, ultimately lowering any possibility of a prolongation of inflation and reducing the cost of future policy responses.",
        "The member mentioned that the central bank should assess the effects of previous rate hikes, the inflation path, risks to economic and financial stability, and monetary policy changes in major countries before deciding whether to make further adjustments to the Base Rate.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho Yoon-Je expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level, and argued for raising it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Rate unchanged at 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "It is forecast that inflation will continue to be above the target level throughout the year, although it is projected to gradually decrease, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are also judged to be high.",
        "The Board, therefore, sees that it is appropriate to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while assessing the pace of inflation slowdown and developments in the uncertainties.",
        "- Currently available information suggests that the slowdown of global economic growth and inflation has continued.",
        "However, concerns about a recession in major countries have somewhat decreased due to the easing of concerns over energy supply and demand, as well as labor market conditions continuing to be favorable, and the pace of inflation slowdown in the U.S. has been modest.",
        "In global financial markets, volatility in major price variables has increased.",
        "The U.S. dollar has shifted to a rapid strengthening after continuing to weaken, and long-term market interest rates have rebounded considerably, led by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s terminal rate will be higher than previously expected after the announcement of U.S. labor market and price indicators exceeding market expectations.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pace of global inflation slowdown, monetary policy changes in major countries and U.S. dollar trends, the recovery in the Chinese economy after the easing of its COVID-19 restrictions, and geopolitical risks.",
        "- Although concerns about a recession in major countries have eased, domestic economic growth has continued to slow, with the recovery in private consumption weakening and exports continuing to decrease due to deepened sluggishness in the IT industry.",
        "Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to the economic slowdown.",
        "Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to remain weak, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates.",
        "Domestic economic growth is expected to improve gradually from the second half of this year with a recovery in the Chinese economy and in the IT industry.",
        "However, uncertainties regarding the outlook are judged to be high.",
        "GDP growth for this year is projected to be 1.6%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 1.7%.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has run at 5.2% in January, which has been higher than the 5.0% in December, due to increases in electricity fees as well as rising prices of processed food products, although increases in the price of petroleum products have moderated.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at 4.1% in January.",
        "Short-term inflation expectations among the general public have run at 4.0% in February.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain around 5% in February, but will gradually decrease owing to the base effect from the sharp rises in global oil prices last year and weakening pressure from the demand side.",
        "However, the pace of slowdown is expected to be more modest than in major countries due to the effects of the increases in public utility fees.",
        "Consumer price inflation for this year is projected to be 3.5%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 3.6%.",
        "Uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high, regarding movements of global oil prices and exchange rates, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the size and effects of the increases in public utility fees.",
        "- In financial and foreign exchange markets, volatility has increased in February with a considerable rebound in the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate and in market interest rates, which have shown a decrease since last November due to the possibility of further tightening of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy stance.",
        "The decrease in household loans has widened, and housing prices have continued to decline across all parts of the country.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "Inflation is projected to remain high above the target level although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are high.",
        "The Board, therefore, deems it warranted to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while maintaining the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time with an emphasis on ensuring price stability.",
        "In this process, the Board will thoroughly assess the pace of inflation slowdown, the economic downside risks and financial stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "At the November 30 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member argued that it would be appropritate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at changes in global economic conditions since the October meeting, the member said that the expectations of an early end to the tightening cycle of monetary policy had heightened due to the faster-than-expected slowdown in inflation in major advanced economies.",
        "The member added that concerns about the spread of the Irael-Hamas conflict had been somewhat mitigated, leading to falls in global oil prices.",
        "However, the member noted that there were still lingering uncertainties in relation to the development of geopolitical risks and the impacts of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s prolongation of its monetary tightening stance.",
        "Concerning global financial markets, the member stated that amid reduced geopolitical risks, U.S. Treasury bond yields, which had significantly risen, declined again.",
        "The member added that this was attributable to the softened expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s further rate hikes and adjustments in the pace of long-term bond issuance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and thanks to a weakened U.S. dollar.",
        "Looking at domestic conditions, the member expected economic growth to continue its modest improvement on the back of reviving exports.",
        "However, the member assessed that growth for next year was predicted to fall slightly short of the August forecast due to the tentative recovery of consumption and the prolongation of tightening monetary policy at home and abroad.",
        "The member commented that the future growth path is surrounded by high uncertainties over the effects of the protracted monetary tightening cycles in major economies, developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the speed of any recovery in the IT sector.",
        "The member stated that consumer price inflation had somewhat increased stemming from rises in the prices of global oil and agricultural products, and that short-term inflation expectations had also risen slightly.",
        "On the other hand, the member noted that core inflation had declined moderately.",
        "The member assessed that inflation for this year and next was projected to be higher than the August forecast, but that it will continue with its modest slowdown.",
        "However, the member judged that there were high uncertainties regarding supply-related factors on the future inflation trajectory.",
        "The member emphasized the need to be mindful of the possibility that cost pressures could expand due to supply shocks, which could lead to inflation remaining elevated, and to a possible delay of inflation convergence on the target level amid the combination of inflation expectations.",
        "The member mentioned that in financial markets, Korean Treasury bond yields, which had risen significantly in October, had declined upon expectations of an end to policy rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and that stock prices rebounded.",
        "The member stated that household loans by the financial sector had continued to grow, driven by housing-related loans, and that it would be necessary to watch the trend further due to rising lending rates, the decreasing extent of housing price hikes and transaction volumes, and due to the government’s reinforced household debt management program.",
        "The member judged that, although liquidity risks had been easing, the delinquency rate had kept rising at a high level so that the potential for credit risks to occur was still present.",
        "The member noted that in the foreign exchange market the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate was stable in November.",
        "The member viewed that, going forward, the exchange rate would likely fluctuate depending on developments in FX-related factors, such as geopolitical risks, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer stance, and the current account.",
        "In summary, the member assessed that, as core inflation had continued its slowing trend, consumer price inflation was also predicted to decline gradually going forward.",
        "The member added that against this backdrop, it would be necessary to further watch the household loan trend.",
        "The member also noted that there were still lingering uncertainties regarding global economic conditions and monetary policies.",
        "Therefore, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate steady at the current 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "However, the member stressed that if the pace of convergence on the inflation target was judged to be more delayed than previously expected due to growing supply-side inflationary pressures and inflation expectations, it would be essential to consider additional policy measures.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at the global economy, the member stated that, since the previous Monetary Policy Board (MPB) meeting, the degree of tightening in international financial markets had eased somewhat, with major country government bond yields declining significantly due to expectations of an end to rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, fueled by the weakening October employment and inflation indicators in the United States.",
        "The member saw that, additionally, amid the reduced possibility of an escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict, geopolitical uncertainties decreased considerably, and economic growth trends differed from country to country.",
        "However, the member pointed out that signs of a gradual slowdown in growth had emerged in the U.S. as the effects of the accumulated tightening policy have begun to show, even through the U.S. had been the only major advanced economy exhibiting robust growth based on solid consumption and employment conditions so far.",
        "The member judged that, furthermore, with the labor market imbalances gradually easing, inflation would be highly likely to slow gradually going forward.",
        "The member saw that, in China, the government's stimulus policy measures had eased the sluggishness, but downside factors, such as a sluggish real estate market and declining exports stemming from weak external demand, continued to restrain the recovery momentum.",
        "The member projected that, in the euro area, modest growth would persist for a significant time due to high inflation and interest rates.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy was exhibiting a gradual recovery trend, as private consumption showed a slight rebound and as exports continued to improve despite subdued global trade conditions.",
        "The member expected next year's growth to sustain a trend of gradual improvement, supported by the recovery in exports.",
        "However, the member added that downside risks still persisted, such as the possibility of an economic slowdown in major countries, including China, and the potential prolongation of a global tightening policy stance.",
        "The member saw that employment conditions had generally been favorable, thanks to the low unemployment rate and the high employment rate.",
        "However, the member stated that the increase in the number of persons newly employed was continuing primarily among the elderly and women.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member commented that consumer price inflation showed a level higher than the previous forecast path due to the impact of rising energy and agricultural product prices.",
        "The member added that, consequently, the future forecast path had been slightly adjusted upwards.",
        "The member analyzed that momentum had been gradually weakening since the latter half of this year, although core inflation had exhibited a slower pace of deceleration due to the spillover effects from accumulated cost pressures.",
        "The member saw that future consumer prices might resume a decelerating trend.",
        "However, the member also noted that uncertainties regarding the pace of deceleration were significant due to a mix of upside and downside risks, such as domestic and international economic trends and a decline in international oil prices resulting from assuaged geopolitical uncertainties of late.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member noted that financial conditions had eased somewhat as Treasury bond yields had declined significantly in-line with the decrease in U.S. Treasury bond yields stemming from expectations for an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.",
        "The member stated, however, that there were destabilizing factors caused by high interest rates, such as difficulties in the refinancing of some PF ABCPs and larger spreads between bank debenture rates and the Base Rate, and between CP rates and the Base Rate.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that there was a growing need to manage macro leverage, since household and corporate loans were continuing to increase despite the high interest rate environment.",
        "The member mentioned that household loans had increased, led mainly by government-sponsored mortgage loans, driven by expectations of real estate price hikes.",
        "The member presented the view that to manage the risk of household debt, it would be desirable to adhere to the general principle of deciding on a line of credit on the assessment of borrowers’ debt servicing capacities in case of government-sponsored loans, as well.",
        "However, the member forecasted that an increasing trend in household loans would slow going forward as downward pressures were more prevalent than upward pressures on housing prices, with the volume of housing up for sale increasing, transactions declining, and transaction prices shifting to a decrease.",
        "The member commented that to manage the risk of corporate debt, it would be necessary to examine the policy financing framework, and to manage it so that a soft landing could be achieved for the debt at small businesses.",
        "In addition, the member stated that it would be advisable to prepare for the potential occurrence of synchronized defaults among businesses in some sectors.",
        "The member stated that the FX markets were stable overall, as the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had declined significantly, affected by the fall in the U.S. dollar index stemming from changes in expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy and as foreign exchange had shifted to net inflows.",
        "In consideration of the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, the member assessed that the current interest rate level was sufficiently tight.",
        "The member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period, and to monitor future growth and inflation trends relative to the forecast path, and financial market conditions for the time being.",
        "Another member presented the opinion that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50%.",
        "The member argued that, considering financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, the Base Rate should be kept at the current level for this meeting.",
        "Looking at the factors affecting rate hikes and cuts, such as inflation and household debt, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation in October reached 3.8% year-on-year, slightly higher than previously forecast, and core inflation had decelerated slowly.",
        "The member pointed out that continous management of household debt would be required as household debt was on the rise.",
        "The member observed that the domestic economy had shown some alleviation in sluggishness and some signs of recovery led by the semiconductor industry, but that the trend of low growth continued.",
        "The member also stated that financial stability risks related to real estate PF loans still existed.",
        "Looking at external conditions, the member assessed that the likelihood of further rate hikes had been declining in-line with falls in consumer price inflation in the U.S. and in the EU.",
        "To go into detail, the member commented that the global economy overall had been undergoing difficulties, affected by persistently high interest rates.",
        "The member observed that, while the U.S. economy had shown a high growth rate this year on the back of robust employment and excess savings, there were two opposing views about the future outlook of a soft landing and an economic recession, based on data such as the slowdown in payroll gains, a rise in the unemployment rate, and a fall in the rate of wage growth.",
        "The member noted that the euro area economy remained sluggish, and that China’s economy was expected to recover to some degree backed by the Chinese government’s stimulus package amid the slump in the real estate industry and weak domestic consumption.",
        "The member also judged that growth in Japan was subdued in the third quarter stemming from tepid domestic demand and that the extent of wage growth for workers going forward was likely to affect the Japanese economy’s consumption and growth.",
        "Looking at domestic financial markets, the member noted that the recent decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields had caused Korean Treasury bond yields to decrease as well, and that it also affected Korean market interest rates, but that rising interest rate volatility influenced by the mutual growth of finance had been keeping Base Rate decisions from achieving their intended effects.",
        "The member commented that the Korean won-U.S. dollar exchange rate had been stabilizing downward since early November due to the weakening U.S. dollar and the outlook for a recovery in the semiconductor industry, to currently fluctuate at around 1,300, and forecasted that the exchange rate would stabilize with its volatility decreasing in-line with growth in exports.",
        "Concerning bank lending to households, the member pointed out that housing-related loans had still been increasing and that it would be therefore necessary to make even more aggressive efforts at loan management to prevent any further rise in the household debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "The member, however, stated that, given that about dependence of their business models on household and corporate loans, it appeared challenging to achieve any remarkable reduction in the pace of lending growth without fundamental changes in their revenue structure, which would require innovation in the banking industry as a whole.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had been increasing over the recent three months and that core inflation had been slowing at a moderate pace, and projected that the future price path would be somewhat higher than the forecast made at the previous meeting.",
        "The member argued that the global oil price trend would be affected not just by future global economic conditions, but also by whether there would be further OPEC+ production cuts.",
        "Regarding the labor market, the member assessed that the employment and umemployment rates had been favorable, boosted by growth in employment of people aged 60 or older, as well as of women, but that employment in the manufacturing sector and among young people had been consistently decreasing.",
        "The member assessed that, in overall consideration of these domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and maintain the monetary tightening stance until there is confidence that inflation could reach its target level, while monitoring domestic and overseas economic trends, financial stability conditions, including household debt and real estate project financing, and monetary policy decisions by the U.S. and other major countries.",
        "Meanwhile, another member judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.50% at the meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had been moving away from the abnormal economic cycle caused by the COVID pandemic and by inflation shocks, gradually returning to its equilibrium level.",
        "The member judged that, despite persistently high uncertainties and risk factors, including higher-for-longer rates, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain segmentation, many countries had been witnessing their growth and inflation returning to their equilibrium levels, boosted by aggressive monetary and fiscal policy responses so far, achieving a soft landing of their economies.",
        "The member, however, forecasted that, since inflation would remain above its target until next year and since interest rates would stay higher for longer, the growth rate would be lower next year in the U.S. and in some other advanced countries heavily dependent on domestic demand, but that growth would continue to return to its equilibrium level.",
        "The member projected that, unlike in major advanced countries whose economies were likely to grow at modest paces, Korea’s growth rate would be higher than this year both next year and the following year, exceeding the potential growth rate, driven by a recovery in exports following the upturn in the global IT cycle and the spread of the booming eco-friendly industry.",
        "The member added that similar growth recovery trends would be seen in other countries with a high proportion of manufacturing among their total exports, such as Germany, Taiwan, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.",
        "The member commented that facilities investment was also expected to expand in-line with the recovery of the IT industry, and went on to state that the largest-ever foreign direct investment during January through September this year, driven by the electrical positive impact on future facilities investment.",
        "The member projected that private consumption, however, would sustain its modest recovery due to debt-servicing burdens, increased demand for precautionary savings due to aging, and a sluggish recovery of foreign tourists.",
        "The member presented the view that consumer price inflation would stabilize gradually, but at a more modest pace than the August forecast.",
        "The member explained that this was because accumulated cost pressures, combined with the economic recovery, could lead to a larger pass-through to prices.",
        "The member also noted that, coupled with rising inflation expectations, the increase in perceived inflation among individuals ― driven by the recent rise in consumer prices, especially for daily necessities, such as agricultural and energy products ― could also contribute to a gradual slowdown in overall inflation.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member noted that declining market rates in major countries, on expectations of an end to rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, had caused long-term market rates to fall and credit spreads to narrow accordingly.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the risk of market instability had been accumulating due to higher-for-longer rates, with some non-banks experiencing delinquency rates on corporate loans surpassing the mid-5% level, accompanied by sustained net redemptions of PF-ABCP.",
        "On the other hand, the member argued that there remained serious concerns about worsening financial imbalances, since household loans in the financial sector maintained their subtantial increase to more than six trillion won, driven chiefly by government-sponsored loans.",
        "Summarizing all these economic and financial conditions, the member assessed that, while the export environment would improve remarkably, consumption had been exhibiting only a modest recovery, inflation had continued to decelerate at a slower-than-expected pace, and financial imbalances caused by an accumulation of private debt had been worsening.",
        "The member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the above-mentioned changes in economic and financial conditions, it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period and monitor domestic and external developments.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had entered a phase of inflation cooling as a result of continued high interest rate policies in major countries.",
        "The member projected that growth of the real economy would slow gradually as the effects of monetary policy tightening were transmitted.",
        "The member commented that the Israel-Hamas conflict had limited impacts so far, but that uncertainties due to geopolitical risks were still elevated.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy had been improving gradually on the back of an export recovery stemming from the rebound in the semiconductor business, but that private consumption and investment had been somewhat sluggish.",
        "The member mentioned that employment had declined in most manufacturing sectors, while the services sector had shown a favorable trend overall, led mainly by increased employment in the health & welfare, information & communications, and specialized science & technology sub-sectors.",
        "In terms of wages, the member commented that real wages declined slightly as nominal wage growth had been below consumer price inflation since 2022.",
        "The member viewed that any consequent declines in household purchasing power seemed to have limited their capacity for consumption.",
        "However, the member assessed that the fall in real wages might have had a positive impact on employment.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had declined to 2.3% in July this year, but that it had risen up again to 3.8% by October.",
        "The member stated that underlying inflation indicators, such as core inflation, had been decelerating at a slower pace than expected from the lower-3% levels, and that short-term inflation expectations among the general public had stopped their downward trends, staying at around 3.3% for four consecutive months.",
        "In the meantime, the member stated that financial and foreign exchange markets showed stability, as expectations for the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes had strengthend.",
        "However, the member noted that delinquency rates on loans to vulnerable sectors, such as real estate PF, continued to rise due to greater interest burdens, and that the size of household loans had increased, led by housing-related loans, depsite the government’s efforts to manage household loans.",
        "The member assessed that the housing market had slowed somewhat owing to lending regulations and rising interest rates, but mentioned that there was a possibility that latent demand for lending could increase rapidly if financial conditions ease, as expectations of housing price hikes still remained.",
        "To stably manage inflation expectations and expectations of housing price hikes, the member stressed the need for continuing deleveraging efforts through the government’s strengthening of household debt management and the maintenance of high-interest rate stances.",
        "The member emphasized that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.50%, and to decide any future policy directions based on close monitoring of achievements and side effects of high-interest rate policies.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member expressed concern that domestic prices were showing an upward trend exceeding the path projected in August, and that the anchoring of inflation at the target level appeared to be delayed, both due to increased upward pressures on the supply side, and that household and corporate loans continued to experience a high growth trend.",
        "On the other hand, the member saw that international oil prices had increased sharply since the previous forecast due to factors such as cuts at OPEC+ and the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "However, the member noted that, as of late, the reemergence of concerns about global demand weakening had led to a decline in international oil prices, and that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had fallen, which was expected to alleviate some of the persistence of the supply-side upward pressures.",
        "The member also expected demand-side pressure not to be significant, since the recovery in domestic consumption also appeared modest.",
        "The member saw that the housing market had also shown some signs of contraction lately.",
        "The member projected that, after November, consumer price inflation would decrease gradually, and that core inflation would continue its underlying trend of deceleration, albeit at a slow pace.",
        "The member also stated that the government was maintaining a sound fiscal policy stance.",
        "Given all these factors, the member saw the need to maintain the Base Rate at the current level for now, while monitoring macroeconomic and financial stability conditions and trends in the price path.",
        "The member stated that price inflation had been persistently exceeding the target level for a considerable period.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, while price inflation was projected to continue an underlying slowdown in the future, core inflation was decelerating slowly and significant uncertainties still appeared to persist concerning the future movements of international oil prices and exchange rates, as well as the magnitude and sustainability of the ripple effects of the accumulated cost pressures so far.",
        "Taking into account factors such as the sustained high growth in household and corporate loans, the member found it desirable to maintain a tightening monetary policy stance going forward.",
        "The member took the view that, in the future, monetary policy will place the greatest emphasis on ensuring that price inflation be rapidly anchored at the target level.",
        "The member argued that policy decisions should be made by comprehensively considering possible financial stability risks, trends in household debt growth, changes in major country monetary policies, foreign exchange market movements, and economic conditions.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that additional tightening should also be considered, if it was anticipated that the inflation trajectory would exceed the currently expected path and that anchoring at the target level would be delayed further.",
        "At the May 25 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinions on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member projected that, although the global economy had maintained more favorable growth than originally forecast in the first quarter of this year, growth would slow going forward due to the effects of monetary tightening in the midst of potential risks of default in the financial sector.",
        "The member indicated that the U.S. economy showed a slow pace of decline in price inflation, as well as moderate growth, bolstered by robust employment and consumption.",
        "The member expected a gradual contraction in the U.S. real economy going forward due to banking sector stress.",
        "The member noted that the Chinese economy was recovering rapidly, led by domestic demand after the reopening, but that the spillover effects from the reopening were not greater than initially expected, as its external trade had been relatively subdued due to a delayed recovery in the global IT industry and a high level of inventory.",
        "The member commented that, going forward, this, combined with structural factors, such as economic and geopolitical fragmentation, and an increase in self-sufficiency in China, would likely work as factors causing uncertainties surrounding the Korean and global economic growth paths.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy was recovering moderately from a sharp contraction at the end of the previous year caused by one-off factors, but that it remained somewhat sluggish affected by downward pressure from external conditions.",
        "The member observed that consumption and production had undergone slight adjustments in April after huge increases in the first quarter, and that investment and exports were also sluggish.",
        "The member added that operating profit margins at listed companies in the first quarter were below the long-term average due to a sharp contraction in their operating profits compared to the same period last year.",
        "The member commented that, after the second half of the year, it was expected that there would be a gradual recovery as external conditions would improve, but that the pace of recovery is expected to be slower than initially anticipated.",
        "Accordingly, the member projected that the growth rate for the year would be 1.4%, slightly lower than the February projection of 1.6%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of the recovery due to a mix of upside and downside risks along the future growth path.",
        "In terms of prices, the member noted that consumer price inflation had shown a clear slowdown due to the base-period effects and a decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "The member also commented that, although the growth momentum of core inflation was seen to have weakened, some rigidity still remained, particularly in service charges.",
        "The member pointed out that, in the second half of the year, it would not likely be easy for inflation to continue its ongoing slowing trend as the base effects of consumer prices were expected to decrease and the extent of any further decline in international oil prices would likely be limited.",
        "Accordingly, the member projected that consumer price inflation and core inflation would exhibit similar movements in the future, influenced by a second round of spillover effects caused by accumulated cost pressures, favorable service demand, labor market conditions, and other factors.",
        "The member remarked that the financial market had generally remained stable as risk aversion sentiment had eased somewhat and as price variables had fluctuated within a limited range.",
        "However, the member noted that the amount of delinquent loans had increased significantly, particularly those taken out after the pandemic, and that this had led to a rise in bank loan delinquency rates.",
        "The member added that delinquency rates of some non-bank financial institutions, which had significantly increased their exposure to real estate financing, had also continued to increase sharply.",
        "The member thus expressed the need to carefully monitor the situation in vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member pointed out a need to pay attention to the possibility of increased instability in the overall financial market, taking into account the fact that a simultaneous increase in the issuance volume in the bond market could cause a greater burden from excess bond supply and affect market interest rates, combined with other financial and economic conditions, in the second half of this year.",
        "The member noted that, in the domestic foreign exchange market, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen influenced by supply conditions, but that it had generally remained stable overall, with decreasing volatility.",
        "The member judged that, considering these domestic and international economic and financial conditions, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member remarked that the current interest rate level was estimated to be consistent with economic growth and the inflation outlook.",
        "The member judged that the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates would have limited impacts on the exchange rate and on foreign exchange supply and demand.",
        "The member mentioned stated that, therefore, it would be desirable to examine a policy direction with a focus placed on domestic conditions, such as growth and inflation, for some time.",
        "Another member assessed that the global economy had been more favorable than originally forecast.",
        "Concerning the U.S. economy, the member remarked that, boosted by a robust labor market and consumption, the U.S. continued to experience steady growth.",
        "The member observed that although the impact of monetary tightening and credit contraction was still limited, the growth outlook was expected to weaken gradually in the second half of the year.",
        "Concerning the Chinese economy, the member assessed that it had exhibited stronger than expected growth with a significant increase in services consumption and sustained growth in fixed asset investment since its reopening, while external trade had been relatively sluggish.",
        "The member mentioned that, amid the eased energy risk, the euro area had been showing gradual improvement, particularly in the services sector.",
        "The member also noted that international oil prices had dropped to the mid-70 dollar level due to concerns about a slowdown in major economies, and that global trade had remained sluggish, primarily in the goods sector.",
        "The member commented that the domestic economy continued to slow with persistent weakness in the IT sector and a delayed spillover effect from China’s reopening.",
        "Regarding private consumption, the member assessed that, while credit card usage appeared to be slowing recently after a significant increase in April, the consumer sentiment index had been improving for three consecutive months.",
        "The member also pointed out that facility investment remained sluggish due to the slowdown in the IT sector, while construction investment had shifted to a decline as new construction starts had slowed due to a reduced budget for government SOC spending.",
        "The member indicated that exports had also remained sluggish, particularly in the IT sector, but that they had eased somewhat recently in terms of average daily exports.",
        "The member noted that employment had been more favorable than initially expected, with steady growth in the number of persons employed in the services sector.",
        "The member also pointed out that the real estate market had seen a slowing decline in housing sales prices and leasehold deposit prices and an increase in transaction volume.",
        "Concerning domestic inflation, the member argued that consumer price inflation had declined substantially due to the base-period effect of petroleum prices, but that the decline was slower than originally expected, with personal service prices sustaining strong growth.",
        "The member judged that the financial and foreign exchange markets had been generally accommodative.",
        "The member assessed that, although domestic short-term interest rates had risen somewhat recently, investor sentiment in financial markets had improved on expectations of an end to the U.S. monetary tightening cycle, and foreign exchange supply and demand conditions remained stable.",
        "The member noted that in April the COFIX rate had fallen below the Base Rate, household lending had shifted to an increase for the first time in eight months, and corporate lending growth had also accelerated.",
        "The member argued meanwhile that, given the volume of the expected issuance of government and public bonds, as well as bank debentures, in the second half of this year, this was likely to put upward pressure on market interest rates.",
        "Furthermore, the member argued that the increased level of interest rates had led to a rise in delinquency rates, particularly among vulnerable borrowers of loans to households, the self-employed and SMEs, and that the upward trend in delinquency rates would continue until the end of this year.",
        "The member presented the view that the current delinquency rate and the estimated level of future delinquencies were still lower than the average delinquency rate over the past decade and were expected to be at a level that the financial sector could tolerate.",
        "However, they went on to argue that it would be necessary to carefully examine and respond to the possibility that loan defaults related to real estate project financing might increase the delinquency rate of some non-bank financial institutions and trigger financial market instability.",
        "The member noted that the Korean won’s exchange rate had been stable overall on the market expectation that the U.S. interest rate hike cycle was coming to an end.",
        "Furthermore, consumer price inflation had been slowing, albeit slower than initially anticipated, and was expected to stabilize at around 3% by the end of the year.",
        "The member also assessed that core inflation remained sticky, raising concerns about inflation persistence, but was expected to decline to the mid- to high 2% range by the end of the year with upward momentum weakening toward the second half of the year.",
        "The member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the above mentioned elements, it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period, while keeping a close watch on growth and inflation trends, stability of the financial sector, the direction of monetary policies in major countries, and developments in foreign exchange and exchange rates.",
        "The member also underscored the need to maintain the monetary tightening stance until there is confidence that inflation will stabilize in the 2% range, and went on to argue that the possibility of further rate hikes should not be ruled out if necessary.",
        "Meanwhile, another member recognized that despite banking sector instability, such as the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) bankruptcy, the world economy exhibited a better than expected trend.",
        "The member noted that, while the spillover effects of China’s reopening were more delayed than expected and while the expansion of the euro economy was not substantial, the U.S. economy had demonstrated moderate growth backed by solid labor market conditons.",
        "The member mentioned that the domestic economy continued to slow due to sluggishness in the IT industry, including semiconductors, and due to the smaller than expected effects of China’s reopening.",
        "However, the member predicted that the domestic economy would fare slightly better in the second half of the year than in the first half, supported by the recovery of the semiconductor industry.",
        "With regard to external conditions, the member commented that Korea recorded a trade deficit for 14 months in a row through to last month, with exports falling for a seventh straight month since October, and that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had been staying at the industry had been delayed due to a lagging global IT industry and smaller than expected spillover effects from China’s reopening, Korea’s economic recovery had been slow.",
        "The member argued that the rise in self sufficiency concerning China’s intermediate goods worked as a disadvantage for Korea’s exports, given the high proportion of intermediate goods among Korea’s exports to China.",
        "Therefore, the member added that structural changes in export items and a diversification of export destinations were needed.",
        "The member mentioned that due to a combination of these factors, Korea posted a current account deficit in the first quarter this year for the first time in 11 years, since 2012.",
        "The member judged that, while Korea was expected to record a current account surplus for the year, it would be desirable to take more proactive measures in managing the current account balance going forward.",
        "Regarding private consumption, the member commented that the Composite Consumer Sentiment Index (CCSI) had risen and that private consumption exhibited a modest improvement led by the services sector, while facilities and construction investment were sluggish.",
        "The member argued that consumer price inflation slowed at a steady pace, as it reached the 3% level in April for the first time in 14 months, but core inflation was sticky at 4.0% for three months in a row as personal service prices remained elevated.",
        "The member noted that with potential destabilizing factors regarding inflation, such as unstable international oil prices stemming from OPEC+’s oil production cuts in the future, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate trends, and possible additional hikes in electricity and gas fees in the second half of the year, uncertainties along the inflation path remained high.",
        "The member mentioned that since the liquidity that had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic was being unwound and since it still acted as a contributor to inflation, it would be necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy for the time being.",
        "The member also noted that, regarding employment conditions, there was an upward trend in the number of employed women and of those aged 60 and older, driven by the services sector.",
        "However, the member added that the number of persons employed in the manufacturing sector had decreased for four months in a row due to decreased exports and a sluggish manufacturing industry, and that there had been a decline in the number of employed young people aged from 15 to The member pointed out that the financial market had been stable recently despite the unrest in the U.S. banking industry.",
        "On the interest rate front, the member saw that, as market interest rates had fallen excessively, it could lessen the extent of financial tightening and work as a constraint on monetary policy effects to some degree.",
        "The member mentioned that, as interest rates are low and the housing market slowdown had moderated recently, bank lending to households, including mortgages, had turned to an increase.",
        "The member noted that, as this will put a drag on the future operation of the economy, including household debt management, it would be necessary to manage the situation more thoroughly.",
        "The member commented that savings banks were highly exposed to real estate project financing loans, which experienced a bank run in 2011 due to loan delinquencies.",
        "The member noted that, though it is true that the probability of a crisis taking place is low compared to the past, because the delinquency rate has been rising recently and as the industry as a whole has posted net losses in the first quarter, risk management was needed.",
        "The member judged that current financial conditions were tight, even considering the Financial Conditions Index (FCI) and the real money gap rate.",
        "Therefore, the member added that, as credit risk issues could emerge from some non-bank financial institutions with high exposure to real estate PF loans in the process of any prolonged monetary policy tightening, it would be necessary to properly respond to those problems when the need arises, while closely monitoring market developments.",
        "The member commented that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had been stuck at around the 1,300 won range recently, owing to the ongoing trade deficit caused by weak exports.",
        "The member assessed that, since the record high interest rate differential between Korea and the U.S. could destabilize exchange rates and expand volatility in the foreign exchange market, it would be important to keep a close eye on foreign exchange movements and prevent any rise in foreign exchange volatility.",
        "In conclusion, the member presented the view that with the destabilizing factors to inflation still present, it would be necessary to maintain a restrictive policy stance until the achievement of price stability becomes certain, and that we needed to pay attention to household debt management and make sure that the record high interest rate gap between Korea and the U.S. does not cause financial market distress.",
        "The member assessed that in overall consideration of the domestic economic and financial conditions mentioned above, it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting and judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further by examining core inflation trends, the growth path, and by monitoring monetary policy changes in major economies going forward.",
        "Another member noted that maintaining the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% would be appropriate for this meeting.",
        "The member commented that, despite high inflation and unrest in the U.S. banking sector, the global economy had been showing a recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, due to accumulated excess savings and improvements in employment.",
        "The member indicated that, in Korea, despite the ongoing recovery trend in private consumption, the growth rate in the first half of this year was lower than those in major countries, as the recovery in the IT industry, which had been expected to rebound after bottoming out in the second quarter, was being delayed, and as the spillover effects from China's reopening were being limited.",
        "The member noted that uncertainties still remained high related to the timing of a rebound in the semiconductor industry, and to recoveries in China-bound exports and foreign tourist inflows.",
        "The member forecast that, in the medium- to long-term, sluggish facilities investment and deteriorating employment quality would act as downside risks to growth potential.",
        "The member commented that, while global inflation was gradually decreasing, it still remained at a high level, particularly in core items, due to the combined effects of the recovery in demand for services and a second round of spillover effects.",
        "The member remarked that, although consumer price inflation in Korea decreased to the 3% range in April, core inflation continued to show downward rigidity, exceeding consumer price inflation.",
        "The member noted that the domestic financial market was maintaining a relatively stable situation with volatility in price variables declining and credit spreads falling slightly.",
        "However, the member assessed that the volatility could increase again depending on the supply of bonds, such as bank debentures, mortgage-backed securities, and KEPCO bonds.",
        "The member added that there were significant potential risks with the delinquency rates for non-bank institutions, especially in vulnerable industries, continuing to rise.",
        "The member presented the view that, in overall consideration of these economic and financial conditions, it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate at the current level and monitor the spillover effects of interest rate policy and the development of domestic and international economic conditions for some time.",
        "The member argued that, looking ahead, it would be necessary to maintain the current tightening stance for a considerable time, taking into account a couple of points.",
        "First, the member mentioned that, while disinflation was ongoing, consumer price inflation was expected to remain at the high level of around 3% in the second half of this year, and that the pace of decline in core inflation was expected to be very moderate.",
        "The member noted that, looking at the past pace compared to consumer inflation, leading to a narrowing or reversal of the gap between the two.",
        "However, the member noted that the current deflationary period had the characteristics of an even more moderate pace of decline in core inflation due to combined effects of a number of price shocks.",
        "The member pointed out that, in particular, the highly persistent core service inflation appeared to be because the accumulative cost-increasing factors, such as oil prices, exchange rates, wages, rents, and borrowing costs, were being passed on to consumer prices on the back of the recovery in the services sector since last year.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it was fortunate that the downward trend in inflation expectations had been ongoing since the beginning of this year, but considering the long lag in the transmission of inflationary pressures, it would be necessary to keep a close eye on inflation for a considerable time.",
        "Second, the member recognized the need to take into consideration the fact that there was still significant concern about financial imbalances.",
        "The member remarked that, while household loans in the financial sector had deleveraged since September last year, they turned positive in April due to a shift to an increase in home mortgage loans and a slower decline in credit loans.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, while this was attributable to an increase in policy financing, such as Special Bogeumjari Loans stemming from weakened expectations for domestic and international rate hikes also had a significant impact.",
        "Third, the member also expressed the need to consider that there is a significant risk of increased exchange rate volatility.",
        "The member indicated that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had generally been led by the movements of the U.S. dollar index until early this year.",
        "However, the member observed that, as domestic factors, such as concerns about the current account, had become more prominent since March, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had been showing a weakening trend, accompanied by a weakening of the U.S. dollar.",
        "The member argued that volatility of the Korean won could expand again if international financial risks, such as negotiations on the U.S. debt ceiling, increased, and all of this would be occurring in the current situation where there was still room for an additional rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "The member argued that, taking these factors into account, it would be necessary to maintain the current tightening stance for a considerable time in the conduct of monetary policy, while pursuing price stability and domestic and international financial stability.",
        "The member also emphasized the need for stronger collaborative operational efforts with financial and fiscal policies to ensure a stable economic recovery and to achieve structural improvements.",
        "Another member commented that, while world economic growth was projected to decelerate slightly, consumer price inflation in most countries seemed to have peaked, though core inflation still remained elevated.",
        "The member noted that there were still high uncertainties concerning external conditions, including financial unrest resulting from the collapse of some banks overseas.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that, although economic growth had fallen short of earlier expectations, the number of persons employed maintained a better than expected trend.",
        "However, the member remarked that, while the recovery of employment since the COVID-19 pandemic had been driven by the elderly and women, employment of the young and of middle-aged men had been improving at a slow pace.",
        "The member noted that this was primarily attributable to the downturn in the manufacturing and construction industries, but that it was also affected by structural changes in those industries.",
        "The member therefore judged that the effects of interest rate policy on employment would be somewhat limited.",
        "The member commented that, although various price indices, including consumer price inflation, had seemingly peaked, core inflation has been sticky, as in other countries.",
        "Given the potential increases in public utility fees and the Korean economy’s characteristics of there being heavy reliance on external conditions, the member argued that it would be imperative for us to maintain a vigilant stance.",
        "The member judged that it would be desirable to take a conservative approach to inflation, since it could have great negative effects on the economy across the board if inflation expectations were to become anchored at high levels.",
        "As for the financial and foreign exchange sectors, the member assessed that the impacts of the interest rate differential, as well as the U.S. banking crisis, on exchange rates were limited.",
        "However, the member raised concerns that, while many countries had witnessed deleveraging of household debt as a result of interest rate hikes thus far, deleveraging has not been sufficiently achieved in Korea.",
        "The member noted that the high household debt ratio could weigh on future policy operations.",
        "The member also argued that the rapidly rising delinquency rate on loans to low-credit borrowers and small businesses could be another potential risk factor.",
        "The member noted that, in sum, even though consumer price inflation had peaked and entered a cooling phase, we couldn’t yet afford to be complacent.",
        "The member argued that, given that the current monetary policy tightening stance had begun in order to deal with a buildup in financial imbalances and inflation, it would be premature to let our guard down now.",
        "The member deemed it warranted to freeze the Base Rate at the current 3.5% amid high uncertainties at home and abroad, and observe whether the policy target would be fully achieved by closely monitoring risk factors to inflation and financial stability.",
        "Another member assessed that the domestic economy continued to experience a slowdown in growth.",
        "The member stated that exports and facilities investment had remained sluggish, as downside risks from the overseas sector had materialized, such as the continued contraction of the global IT industry and the delayed spillover effects of China’s reopening.",
        "The member however judged that private consumption had sustained its recovery momentum, particularly in the services sector, and added that the favorable employment situation had been supporting household income and partly offsetting the economic downturn.",
        "The member expected this sluggishness to ease into the second half of the year.",
        "The member forecast that services consumption would continue its moderate recovery and exports would also improve with the easing of sluggishness in the Chinese economy and the IT sector.",
        "The member however projected that the pace of growth recovery would be slower than previously forecast in February.",
        "The member pointed to the need to note that this growth path was accompanied by significant inherent upside and downside risks, due to various uncertain factors, such as the timing of the IT sector rebound and the pace of China’s economic recovery.",
        "The member noted that inflation remained well above its target.",
        "The member assessed that consumer price inflation had declined to the upper 3% level in April, due mainly to stronger base-period effects of supply factors, such as petroleum product prices, while core inflation, excluding food and energy, had been sticky, remaining high at 4.0% for the third consecutive month.",
        "The member judged that prices of personal services, which have strong downward rigidity, maintained a strong upward trend, boosted by robust demand for services, while spillover effects from cost increases, such as electricity and gas charges, also added to the upward pressure on core inflation.",
        "The member forecast that consumer price inflation would show a distinct slowdown for some time due to the base-period effect, while core inflation, representing the trend of inflation, is facing increased upside risks.",
        "The member assessed that the decline in core inflation had been slower than expected due to the continued pass-through of accumulated cost pressures into prices and the sustained upward momentum of service prices.",
        "The member judged that, given the stickiness of prices and inherent uncertainties, it would be necessary to maintain a monetary tightening stance for a considerable period of time in order to anchor inflation to the target path.",
        "Looking at the financial situation, the member assessed that the current Base Rate was analyzed to be in restrictive territory, running well above the neutral rate range, while overall financial conditions had become much less tight compared with the previous year-end.",
        "The member noted that both short- and long-term Treasury bond yields had been below the Base Rate since the beginning of the year, and bank deposit and lending rates had also declined substantially.",
        "Regarding credit supply, the member indicated that corporate lending continued to show strong growth, and that household lending growth was shifting back to an increase driven by increased demand for housing-related funds.",
        "More specifically, the member added that the real estate sector was exhibiting a slower adjustment recently, with real estate price indices declining at a much slower pace and apartment transaction prices showing an upward trend in certain areas.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed that the risks of financial instability, which had been a concern, appeared to have eased somewhat.",
        "The member argued that the financial and foreign exchange markets in Korea remained stable overall, as instability surrounding small and medium-sized U.S. banks and the debt ceiling issue remained as factors increasing market volatility, but had only limited impact on international financial markets.",
        "The member also judged that the risk of real estate-related defaults spreading to the entire market had decreased, as the decline in housing prices had slowed.",
        "The member, however, argued that, given deteriorating funding conditions in the real estate and construction sectors, it would be important to closely monitor the soundness of non-bank financial institutions with high exposure to these vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member noted that, taking into consideration these overall situations, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period, while continuing to monitor developments in the real economy, including growth and inflation.",
        "The member presented the view that, concerning inflation, upside risks had increased due to stickier than expected core inflation, but in terms of growth, there were considerable uncertainties surrounding the IT industry, the Chinese economy, and the U.S. financial situation.",
        "The member emphasized that, given the recent slow decline in core inflation, it would be particularly necessary to closely examine whether there is any possibility of inflation deviating from its original forecast path due to financial conditions that had eased significantly compared to the policy stance.",
        "The member added that, if convergence of inflation on its target level is deemed to be significantly delayed, aggressive measures should be taken through additional rate hikes.",
        "At the April 11 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinions on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.5% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member assessed that the domestic economy had continued to slow since the latter half of last year.",
        "The member saw that private consumption was continuing to show sound growth thanks primarily to solid service consumption in line with the expansion of face-to-face activities in the midst of somewhat improved consumer sentiment.",
        "However, the member commented that exports and facilities investment were sluggish due to a delay in the spillover effects of the economic reopening in China in the midst of a contraction in the global IT industry.",
        "The member saw that the labor market still appeared to remain solid despite slower growth.",
        "The member stated that, while the pace of increase in the number of persons employed had slowed somewhat of late, demand for labor remained steady, particularly in the face-to-face services industry.",
        "The member projected that, while the domestic economy would maintain its slowing trend for some time, it would recover gradually, led by exports, from the latter half of this year, bolstered by the effects of the economic reopening in China and a recovery in the IT industry.",
        "However, the member judged that downside risks to the growth path had increased somewhat since the previous MPB meeting.",
        "The member saw that there were high uncertainties related to monetary policy stances in major countries, to the trends of recovery in China and the IT industry, and to the domestic housing market.",
        "The member also stated that there were significant risks related to unrest in the global banking sector as seen particularly in the failures of SVB and Credit Suisse.",
        "The member commented that inflation was running well above its target.",
        "The member saw that, while consumer price inflation declined significantly to the lower-4% level in March due, for instance, to a base effect, it still remained elevated.",
        "The member stated that core inflation less foods and energy showed a slow pace of decline, remaining the same from the previous month, and highly persistent personal service charges remained elevated.",
        "The member expected inflation to slow gradually, but added that uncertainties related to the pace of its decline are very high.",
        "The member saw that, with core inflation showing sticky movements since the end of last year, the economic reopening in China and production cuts by oil producing countries were acting as upside risks to international commodity prices, and, on the domestic front, deffered increases in public utility fees were serving as potential factors making for price instablity.",
        "The member also anticipated a second round of spillover effects, wherein corporations would further pass on the increased costs to consumers in the form of higher product prices, owing to the persistently high inflation environment.",
        "The member judged that, taking into account these factors, it was still too early to have confidence that underlying inflation would be stabilized downward.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member assessed that, while the current Base Rate appeared to have reached a restrictive level, given the accumulated extent of rate hikes and the neutral interest rate level, significant declines in long-term and short-term interest rates were weakening the degree of financial tightening of financial conditions, and, on the liquidity front, it was difficult to say that the current liquidity level was greatly constraining economic activities of households and corporations, judging from various indicators such as M2 growth and the real money gap.",
        "However, the member deemed it warranted to observe further the spillover effects of the Base Rate hikes, in that Base Rate hikes would affect the real economy after a time gap.",
        "Meanwhile, the member saw that, as a series of financial incidents had weakened confidence in the banking systems in the U.S. and Europe since the previous MPB meeting, volatility in the global financial market had heightened greatly and liquidity conditions had worsened.",
        "The member stated that, fortunately, financial unrest had eased rapidly thanks to swift countermeasures, but concern about a possible spread of the related risk, including withdrawals of funds from bank deposits, was ongoing.",
        "The member stated that, although the domestic financial market remained stable, if this financial unrest in the international financial market reemerged, it could spill over to the domestic financial market.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that close attention should be paid to the possibility of credit risks in the real estate sector materializing, particularly in less-regulated non-bank financial institutions, in case of a shock, and such risks speading to other sectors.",
        "In conclusion, concerning the fact that inflation is still high and uncertainties remain with regard to the pace of any future slowdown, the member stated that it would be necessary to maintain the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time until the Board is confident of price stability.",
        "However, the member stressed the need to operate monetary policy cautiously, while examining the effects of the rate hikes so far, major economic indicators and future developments in terms of financial unrest, as financial stability risks also appeared to have increased both domestically and internationally.",
        "Accordingly, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member went on to argue that it would be necessary to consider whether the Base Rate needs to rise further depending on developments of inflation and monetary policy in major countries.",
        "On the other hand, the member saw that, as there was a possibility of financial unrest at home and abroad, it would be necessary to reduce risk in the vulnable sectors through macroprudential policy tools and make preemptive efforts to strengthen the resilience of the financial system.",
        "The member added that, in the event of any financial unrest, it would be necessary to take actions using market stabilization measures, including short-term liquidity injections.",
        "Meanwhile, another member took the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was that private consumption had been favorable, recovering from the sluggishness in the fourth quarter last year, with goods and services consumption all increasing in February and March.",
        "The member also mentioned that the number of persons employed, meanwhile, had grown at a slower pace, affected by an economic slowdown, and that exports remained on a downward path due to the sluggishness in exports of key items such as semiconductors and steel, and also in exports to China.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the member stated that delinquencies on corporate loans from non-bank financial institutions had continued to rise, which was more pronounced in the real estate sector and in provincial areas.",
        "The member argued that, compared with the previous savings bank crisis, the current percentage of loans extended to the real estate and construction sectors among total lending, delinquency rates and substandard asset rates are far lower now than during the previous crisis, but that attention should still be paid in order to prevent any prolongation of such delinquencies, which could aggravate financial pressure on financial institutions.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation had been slowing after having peaked in July last year, while core inflation had remained sticky at around 4%.",
        "The member noted that growth in dining-out expenses and rents had exhibited a relatively pronounced slowdown, putting downward pressure on core inflation.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation in personal services and industrial goods excluding petroleum products and personal services excluding dining-out had remained at 4%, however.",
        "The member argued that, while keeping an eye on these matters, it would be necessary to consider movements of international oil prices and the exchange rate, as well as the timing and extent of hikes in public utility charges, to see whether inflation would be consistent with the BOK path forecast.",
        "With regard to future Base Rate decisions, the member stated that attention should be paid to the following, along with the pace of decline in the core inflation rate on the inflation front.",
        "First, the member noted that it would be necessary to consider the possibility of policy rate hike stances continuing at the Fed or other advanced economy central banks.",
        "The member mentioned that despite the view that the SBV and CS incidents in March would shrink credit supply, and that they could result in an economic slowdown, financial markets were stabilizing at a rapid pace.",
        "On the other hand, the member assessed that core inflation in the U.S. had not declined greatly from the level seen in the second half of last year, and that it was rising in the euro area.",
        "The member presented the view that it would be necessary to keep a close watch on how Fed decisions, foreign investment fund flows, current account trends, and market expectation interactions would affect the exchange rate and import prices.",
        "Second, the member evaluated that attention should be paid to the adequacy of the pace of disinflation.",
        "The member commented that even if consumer price inflation declined in line with the forecast path of the Bank of Korea, the Board should assess whether the pace of disinflation aligned with the 2% target on the Bank of Korea’s medium-term horizon, taking into account persistent impacts of internal and external shocks on inflation.",
        "Moreover, the member added that reviewing the soundness of financial institutions would be necessary, considering that it had been almost two years since the policy rate hike stance began, and that the possibility of a tightening stance would continue for the time being.",
        "The member stated that there were still high uncertainties regarding external economies that were affecting the Korean economy.",
        "The member judged that external factors, such as the timing of any recovery in the IT business, spillover effects from China’s reopening, and fragmentation would have significant impacts on growth in the Korean economy.",
        "The member noted that the impacts would be highly uncertain on both the upside and the downside, and that it would be important to identify what impacts these external factors would have on long-term trends, such as potential GDP, and on short-term factors, such as the economic cycle.",
        "The member commented that making a distinction between secular changes in the potential growth rate and cyclical phases would be essential, and that monetary policy should be implemented for the latter, where monetary policy can and should address matters.",
        "However, the member mentioned that there was concern that factors such as the U.S.-China conflict and U.S. industrial policies were not only affecting the recovery of the Korean economy in the short-term after the pandemic, but also long-term growth factors.",
        "The member also assessed that it was difficult to distinguish clearly between short-term and long-term impacts of these factors.",
        "For example, the member saw that higher self-sufficiency in intermediate goods in China could affect the Korean economic recovery by weakening the spillover effects from China’s reopening in the short-term, but that this could be related to the growth engine of the Korean economy in the long-term from the perspective of changes in exports and imports and in industrial structures.",
        "The member commented that a distinction between long-term trends and short-term economic cycles was also important in terms of financial dominance.",
        "The member stated that the implementation of an accommodative monetary policy without separating low growth caused by structural factors from that induced by cyclical factors could lead to financial imbalances characterized by higher leverages and asset price bubbles.",
        "The member noted that excessive financial imbalances could result in financial dominance where considerations of financial stability may result in a negligible response to inflation.",
        "Moreover, the member emphasized the need to clearly recognize that higher leverage could accelerate low growth trends and increase the possibility of deflation in the future by bringing future production and consumption resources into the present.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to respond to changes in long-term trends and short-term economic cycles with separate instruments, just like sticking to the separation principle, which dictates separate responses to current inflation and financial stability issues.",
        "As this distinction is very important and difficult, the member stressed that, along with research into factors affecting long-term trends, such as demographic changes and productivity, the Bank of Korea needed to take a lead in and continue its research on new policy instruments for areas where monetary policy responses were difficult and inappropriate, and set up a policy mix with existing macroprudential policies and fiscal policies.",
        "Another member noted that, with respect to the global economy, the downside risks to the growth path had grown, as the risk of defaults in the financial sector had been materializing in consequence of the continued monetary policy tightening, as seen in the collapse of SVB and CS.",
        "The member stated that in the U.S., the real economy had started to show signs of a gradual slowdown, with some employment indicators worsening somewhat, but overall employment and consumption remained favorable and inflation had been falling slowly.",
        "The member mentioned that, although financial market unrest had increased somewhat after the failure of SVB and eased later thanks to aggressive policy measures, vulnerabilities still remained, and went on to state that trade-offs between price stability and financial stability had been increasing gradually in the implementation of monetary policy in this regard.",
        "The member meanwhile presented the view that, although the Chinese economy had been recovering rapidly since its reopening, led by domestic demand, the country’s imports and exports had continued to decline due to the sluggishness of the global IT industry and a high level of inventory, which would likely limit the growth path of the global economy.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that some indicators had rebounded slightly this year, driven by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, but the overall real economy had been slowing, affected by downward pressure from external conditions, such as the IT industry and a decline in exports to China.",
        "The member forecast that, although consumption and production were estimated to have rebounded slightly in the first quarter from their sharp declines at the previous year-end, GDP growth would fall slightly short of the original forecast in the first quarter, as exports and investment had contracted significantly influenced by external conditions.",
        "The member presented the view that GDP growth would recover gradually from the second half of this year, boosted by improvements in exports in line with a recovery in the IT industry and materialized effects from China’s reopening, but that the pace of growth would be more modest than originally expected.",
        "The member forecast that, in this regard, the growth rate for the year would be slightly below the February forecast (1.6%).",
        "The member, however, stated that the timing and pace of the recovery were highly uncertain, depending on the timing of a rebound in the IT industry, spillover effects from the Chinese economy, and global financial market developments following the collapse of SVC and CS.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member‘s evaluation was that consumer price inflation had continued to slow substantially, affected largely by the base-period effects, while core inflation had been somewhat sticky, with both goods and services remaining on the rise.",
        "The member expected that consumer price inflation would continue to slow, generally following the path originally forecast, while core inflation would decelerate at a slower pace.",
        "The member also forecast that the slowdown in inflation might be limited due to high uncertainties surrounding international oil prices, domestic and overseas economic trends, and hikes in public utility charges, and also to larger-than-expected secondary spillover effects resulting from accumulated cost pressures.",
        "With regard to employment, the member stated that growth in the number of persons employed had been slowing at a modest pace and that the pace of growth in basic wages had been slowing slightly.",
        "Regarding financial markets, the member’s assessment was that the volatility of price variables had been easing after having heightened in the wake of the collapse of SVB and CS.",
        "The member presented the view that market interest rates remained excessively low, affected by the fall in U.S. market interest rates, and went on to argue that a prolongation of this trend could limit the transmission of monetary policy, and that a careful watch should be kept on market interest rate developments in this regard.",
        "The member also noted that some non-bank financial institutions that had significantly increased their exposure to real estate financing were experiencing a rapid increase in delinquency rates, suggesting that there were potential risks related to the real estate market.",
        "As for the FX market, the member’s assessment was that the won-dollar exchange rate had remained stable overall, but that the Korean won had depreciated recently relative to other currencies, due mainly to domestic factors such as the continued trade deficit.",
        "The member stated that attention should be paid to exchange rate movements, since the combined effects of domestic factors and destabilizing factors in global financial markets could increase FX market volatility.",
        "Taking the domestic and international economic and financial environment into overall consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting and monitor the transmission of the previous tightening.",
        "The member saw that it would be desirable to make a decision about any additional tightening after examining the future growth and inflation path, as well as domestic and overseas financial market conditions.",
        "Another member mentioned that the global economy had shown a more favorable recovery trend than originally expected this year, but that the possibility of growth weakening had grown due to financial strains after the SVB incident.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member noted that the contribution of exports to growth had been declining greatly with spillover effects from China’s reopening being delayed amid a deepening slump in the IT business, and that facilities and construction investment were forecast to remain sluggish for the time being.",
        "The member stated that private consumption had shown a modest recovery on the back of an additional lifting of restrictions, but that it was unlikely to grow strongly due to interest rate hikes and lower real purchasing power stemming from high inflation.",
        "The member assessed that employment conditions were relatively favorable, given the slowdown in the overall economy.",
        "However, the member added that the effect of wage income on supporting consumption had been weakening compared to last year as the rise in income appeared to have slowed and the increase in the number of persons employed had decelerated over the past few months.",
        "In the meantime, the member evaluated that it would be hard to expect fiscal policy to defend growth this year, as consolidated fiscal expenditures were projected to decline about 4% year-on-year, although government spending was likely to continue rising.",
        "The member took the view that consumer price inflation had declined sharply to the low 4% range in March, while core inflation excluding food and energy had been maintaining a slow deceleration trend, remaining at the level of the previous month (4.0%).",
        "However, the member noted that under the current economic situation, demand-side pressure was not the major reason to slow the pace of an inflation slowdown.",
        "The member stated that spillover effects of changes in non-core inflation on core inflation could persist for some time due to remaining pressure of increasing costs so far, regardless of demand-side pressure.",
        "The member saw that in the course of raising the Base Rate by 300 bp over the past 20 months, the increase in employment and wages had been slowing gradually along with the plunge in real estate prices and the sharp contraction of household credit.",
        "The member commented that it was unclear whether the intertemporal substitution channel was operating due to a savings glut, but that it seemed evident that the effects of monetary tightening had been working through the asset price and credit channels.",
        "The member stated that with the time lag of monetary policy being long and variable, the effects of monetary policy could sometimes last until when it was no longer necessary.",
        "The member saw that further tightening in order to stabilize inflation at the target level would quickly result in the possibility of excessively dampening economic vitality and increasing the risk of financial turbulence.",
        "The member noted that the recent SVB bank collapse in the U.S. had heightened credit risk aversion and that there is a higher chance that financial institutions will respond in a risk averse manner.",
        "The member added that credit contraction and unstable financial conditions would additionally dampen domestic demand by working in the same direction as any Base Rate tightening.",
        "The member viewed that the situation surrounding financial stability could be an inflection point in terms of a shift in the monetary policy stance.",
        "The member judged that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting and examine domestic and overseas financial stability and real economic conditions.",
        "Another member mentioned that the global economy was expected to show higher growth than initially expected earlier this year, thanks to the strong performance of advanced countries and the resumption of economic activity in China.",
        "However, the member added that the downside risk to growth had increased and the outlook for future global interest rates had been revised downward due to financial instability caused by the bankruptcy of SVB in March.",
        "The member noted that global inflation had passed its peak and was easing, but that it still remained at a high level.",
        "The member went on to argue that OPEC+’s additional production cuts and the demand expansion from China’s reopening would be expected to act as upside risks.",
        "The member assessed that although private consumption had experienced a modest recovery, the domestic economy was still struggling with an ongoing economic slowdown caused by sluggish performance in the IT sector, weaker exports to China, and a decline in investment.",
        "Concerning exports, the member mentioned that, despite a stronger-than-expected growth momentum in major trading partners, there had been a continued decline in exports due to the greater impact from the semiconductor industry and the inventory cycle.",
        "The member commented that CPI inflation was expected to slow rapidly in the foreseeable future owing to base effects arising from a substantial increase in the previous year.",
        "However, the member stated that there would be a possibility that hikes in public utility fees and the second-round spillover effect from rising costs would slow the deceleration after the second half of the year when the base effect weakens.",
        "The member also presented the view that core inflation had shown significant persistence at a high level and that inflation expectations among the general public had remained at the upper 3% level.",
        "The member stated that after the SVB incident, risk aversion sentiment had been strengthened globally and that there were also expectations of an easing of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening stance.",
        "As a result, the member added that the financial market had witnessed a substantial decline in government bond yields, while credit spreads for corporate bonds had widenend.",
        "The member went on to stress that even though financial instabilities in the global financial market had been eased considerably in recent times and their impact on the domestic market seemed to be limited, given potential risks in vulnerable sectors it was necessary for authorities to remain alert.",
        "The member noted that household loans had decreased at a slower pace as housing-related loans turned to an increase and that the pace of corporate loans had increased.",
        "The member argued that the following should be considered at this month’s meeting when deciding the Base Rate.",
        "First, the sensitivity of the financial sector and risks from the financial stability perspective had increased following the SVB crisis.",
        "Second, exchange rate volatility and potential FX risks had decreased as the pace and extent of future rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve were expected to be lower than the level anticipated at the Feburary meeting.",
        "Accordingly, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting and cautiously monitor the development of domestic and international financial stability conditions.",
        "However, the member commented on the need to pay attention to remaining concerns about any persistence of inflation, seeing as though core inflation still appeared to be rigid.",
        "The member noted that the central bank should maintain a monetary tightening stance and should consider further rate hikes if needed while assessing the pace of any inflation slowdown and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member stated that, since the beginning of this year, the world economy had sustained a modest recovery, led by the U.S., the eurozone, and China, despite steep rate hikes and high inflation.",
        "However, the member noted that vigilance against financial unrest and downside risks to growth had increased since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March.",
        "The member saw that this had led to a slowing of the pace of tightening by major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.",
        "The member saw that major central banks’ concerns related to a policy balance between price stability and financial stability had grown further due to the coexistence of a risk of a credit crunch constraining growth and a risk of a slowdown in inflation being pushed back, affected by the management of such financial unrest.",
        "The member also commented that the recent financial instability was a kind of unexpected financial unrest, which is unavoidable during a monetary tightening period, and it reminded us of the importance of swift and sophisticated market stabilization measures to deal with this instability.",
        "The member stated that, despite a recovery in private consumption, domestic economic growth was running below its potential growth rate due to a decline in exports.",
        "The member expected the economy to rebound after the latter half of this year, but saw that there still remained high uncertainties surrounding the recovery momentum, such as the IT industry and the Chinese economy.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation declined to 4.2% in March.",
        "The member saw that core inflation remained unchanged at 4% from the previous month, but anticipated that it would slow, as an economic slowdown and declining enegy prices would be reflected after a time gap going forward.",
        "The member saw that in the labor market the extent of increase in the number of persons employed had lessened due to an economic slowdown, but that quantitative employment growth exceeding growth in the working-age population was still continuing.",
        "Nonetheless, the member noted that upward pressure on wages was declining and labor productivity, which had rebounded temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic, was slowing again as employment grew, especially in the low-wage sectors, following recoveries in the hotel & restaurant and health & welfare sectors, as well as growth in the elderly and female participation rates in economic activity.",
        "The member raised great concern that, while the expansion in employment, led by these low-wage sectors, and a contraction in employment in high-wage sectors, such as the manufacturing and financial sectors, would ease inflationary pressure in the labor market, they would work to weaken the base for growth in the long-term.",
        "The member stated that in the financial and foreign exchange markets volatility of price variables had heightened greatly, affected by global financial market movements, but it then declined following the easing of unrest in the banking sector in major countries.",
        "The member saw that the SVB failure was having limited spillover effects thanks to enhanced soundness of the financial system in major countries and improved foreign exchange soundness at home since the outbreak of the global financial crisis.",
        "However, the member argued that there were significant potential risks, such as declines in loans and deposits, and a rise in the loan delinquency rate at non-bank financial institutions with a large exposure to real estate, and the re-widening of credit spreads on low-rated bonds.",
        "The member saw that with respect to the housing and leasehold deposit were showing smaller declines, influenced by the easing of the relevant regulations, but that housing-related loans were increasing again, led by policy financing.",
        "The member thus called for closer attention on this matter.",
        "The member saw the need to keep the Base Rate at the current level at this meeting and monitor the effects of the rate hikes so far and future developments in domestic and overseas economic conditions, given that economic downside risk appears to still be large, that the pace of inflation is slowing down, and that potential risks of financial instability still remain high.",
        "The member projected that inflation would continue to slow, but that it would still be necessary to keep a close eye on it, given the high inflation expectations, the upward trend in personal service charges, which are rigid, and the prospect of a resurgence in international oil prices.",
        "Accordingly, the member argued that the Board should judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further, while examing economic conditions, and prices in particular, considering the environmental change in economic trends and financial stability together in a balanced manner.",
        "At the August 24 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had been slowing due to the accumulated impact of high interest rate policies.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation in most countries had passed its peak, but that uncertainties as to the inflation outlook path were still high.",
        "Looking at domestic economic conditions, the member stated that even though the rebound in the real economy had been less robust than projected, the unemployment rate had notably remained low, and current accounts were anticipated to improve.",
        "The member expressed the view that due to the base-period effect, consumer price inflation had been stablizing at a faster pace and had remained at the 2% range for two consecutive months.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that we couldn’t rule out the possibility that the rate would climb back to around 3%, driven by import prices, including oil prices, and climate conditions.",
        "The member commented that the financial market had shown increased volatility in interest rates and exchange rates due to external factors, such as the rise in U.S. Treasury yields and growing concerns over risks associated with China.",
        "However, the member also noted that private capital flows had, for the most part, followed a steady path.",
        "The member assessed that as the situation regarding the Korean Federation of Community Credit Cooperatives (KFCC) was gradually resolved, discussions about enhancing oversight of the non-banking sector and managing its soundeness had been gaining momentum.",
        "However, the member also pointed out that unless the issue was addressed through concrete and effective structural reforms, there remained a risk of encountering similar challenges in the future.",
        "The member further emphasized that it is time for courage and determination to fundamentally improve the system.",
        "The member judged that, despite Korea's high interest rates, there had been insufficient deleveraging of household and corporate debt.",
        "The member presented the view that while deleveraging may be painful, it does ensure an economy’s soundness and sustainable economic growth in the long-term.",
        "The member added that a somewhat positive aspect was the government debt-to-GDP ratio, which had remained favorable compared to other OECD nations.",
        "However, the member noted that if we included the debts of state-owned enterprises accumulated during COVID, the public sector's debt ratio was estimated to be significantly higher than official statistics.",
        "The member commented that, considering the trends of a low birth rate and an aging population, along with the anticipated rise in welfare expenditures in the future, our mission would be to pass on a sound fiscal legacy to the next generation.",
        "The member stated that maintaining fiscal soundness, as well as a reduction in private sector debt, were crucial in terms of monetary policy operation.",
        "The member added that we had gained clear insight into how substantial fiscal expenditures, which had inevitably heightened during COVID, had impacted inflation.",
        "The member added that history has shown that central bank interest rates and monetary policy were not entirely independent from fiscal policies.",
        "The member stated that over the past several decades, the world had been enjoying growth without inflation.",
        "However, the member pointed out that it is uncertain whether China would be able to sustain its historical role as a global manufacturing hub, which had supplied affordable products in large quantities.",
        "The member commented that the momentum for trade expansion and globalization, which had led us to economic growth with low inflation, became weakened due to the changes in international politics and economic environments.",
        "The member added that now is the time for us to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% and to monitor the effects of the high interest rate policy that we have kept so far.",
        "At the same time, the member presented the opinion that we needed to put our utmost effort into preparing for uncertainties that may unfold in the future and in enhancing economic resilience.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member saw that, while the global economy had maintained relatively robust growth despite ongoing interest rate increases and persistent inflation, there had been an intensification of divergence among countries.",
        "The member stated that, in the cases of the U.S. and Japan, growth had exceeded expectations, driven by the recovery in demand for services and favorable employment conditions.",
        "However, the member noted that in China the prolonged slump in exports and stress on the real estate market there had led to a heightened risk of a slowdown in structural growth.",
        "The member noted that, in our economy, concerns about the future growth trajectory had grown as service consumption had weakened in the midst of a sustained export slump.",
        "Nonetheless, the member pointed out some positive factors, such as the increase in semiconductor exports since May, improved conditions for Chinese tourist visits to Korea, and a record-high declared foreign direct investment amount in the second quarter.",
        "However, the member also presented the view that it would be difficult to expect a rapid rebound due to the lack of any clear improvement in the export slump, particularly in exports to China, as well as because of intensified constraints on structural growth, including weakening consumption propensity in-line with the population aging, reduced consumption and investment capacity stemming from accumulated debt, and deteriorating job quality.",
        "The member projected that consumer prices and core inflation would converge to around 3% in the latter half of this year and to the lower to mid-2% range next year, as initially expected.",
        "The member saw that, on the financial stability front, imbalances between the real and financial sectors were widening again due mainly to the continued increase in private sector debt and the accelerating uptrend in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area, although growth and inflation were expected to gradually converge toward more balanced levels.",
        "The member noted that, in particular, household debt was maintaining high growth due to a combination of supply factors, such as policy financing support, and demand factors, driven by expectations of housing price increases.",
        "The member thus urgently called for a more proactive policy response.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that in financial markets, long-term market interest rates had risen, affected by expectations of a prolonged tightening stance by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "The member argued that, while such a synchronization of the financial cycle with a key currency country could have positive effects in preventing any excessive widening of domestic and foreign interest rate differentials, attention should be paid to the possibility that it could weaken the transmission channel of domestic monetary policy.",
        "The member commented that, in foreign exchange markets, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen significantly due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.",
        "The member pointed out that high exchange rate volatility could persist for some time, depending on the movements of major currencies.",
        "Therefore, the member saw the need for economic entities to strengthen their preparations for exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "The member assessed that, while inflation would likely generally maintain the initially projected trajectory going forward, the trade-off among policy objectives had grown, as downside risks to growth had increased and as financial imbalances had expanded.",
        "The member judged that, taking into comprehensive account these changes in economic and financial conditions, it would be necessary to maintain the Base Rate at the current level at this meeting, while monitoring future changes in domestic and international conditions, such as growth and inflation trajectories, financial stability conditions, major country monetary policies, and economic fluctuations.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that major economies had shown more favorable growth than expected, but they were expected to continue to slow going forward.",
        "In global financial markets, the member observed that, while long-term government bond yields in major economies had risen rapidly, other price variables, including stock prices and exchange rates, had fluctuated considerably depending on changes in expectations of monetary policy in major countries.",
        "The member viewed that the improvement in domestic economic growth had slowed somewhat.",
        "The member saw that, while the decline in exports had expanded again owing to the continuous slump in the semiconductor industry and a weakened recovery trend in China’s economy, facilities investment remained sluggish, as well.",
        "The member mentioned that the recovery in private consumption had also slowed, affected by aggravated weather conditions and weak pent-up consumption.",
        "The member judged that the domestic economic growth trend would be consistent with the May forecast in general, but that uncertainties remained high surrounding major variables on the growth path, such as growth trends in major economies and the timing of the IT sector recovery.",
        "The member stated that consumer price inflation had continued to moderate.",
        "The member observed that, as petroleum product prices had fallen significantly owing to the base effect from the surge in global oil prices last year, and as the rise in the prices of personal services and processed food products had continued to slow, consumer price inflation fell to the lower 2% level in July.",
        "The member mentioned that core inflation had also slowed at a modest pace.",
        "The member expected inflation to fluctuate slightly going forward, but to continue its modest slowdown pace.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that it would be necessary to watch the pace of decline in core inflation more carefully.",
        "The member added that the key point here was how long the effects of accumulated cost pressure would last.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member assessed that volatility had heightened due to the rise in government bond yields in major economies and uncertainties over China’s economic recovery.",
        "Looking at the housing market and household debt conditions, the member noted that housing prices shifted to a rise, led by the Seoul metropolitan area, and that household debt grew by a larger extent driven by mortgage loans.",
        "Given these circumstances, the member pointed out the need to be attentive to the possibility of delayed deleveraging of household debt, namely, the resumption of household debt accumulation.",
        "In summary, the member stated that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.50% at this meeting, given high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path and inflation, as well as the need to prevent financial imbalances from escalating.",
        "With respect to the monetary policy direction going forward, the member observed that the Board would have to adjust the extent of policy tightening through further rate hikes, if necessary, while thoroughly monitoring whether major indicators could mean a downward stabilization of inflation and a resolution of financial imbalances.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the view that maintaining the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% would be appropriate at this meeting.",
        "Concerning the global economy, the member noted that the possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy was rising, supported by brisk consumption and production based on solid employment.",
        "Meanwhile, the member commented that China was at a stage of possible deflation, as inflation fell amid the slowing economy.",
        "The member added that in China there are growing concerns about financial unrest due to the petition for bankruptcy and the potential default of real estate developers.",
        "In the euro area, the member stated that Germany had been experiencing difficulties, but that the slump had been somewhat easing overall on the back of an improvement in the service industry, including tourism.",
        "The member noted that the Japanese economy showed favorable growth, emerging from the sluggishness that had lasted for the past three decades, thanks to the rise in facilities investment and foreign tourists, but that it remained to be seen whether the growth would continue due to tepid consumption.",
        "Regarding the Korean economy, the member assessed that its economic slowdown had been easing gradually and that the economic recovery trend would continue due to an improvement in the IT sector and a rise in the number of Chinese tourists, but that the degree of improvement would differ depending on China’s recovery from its recession and on the extent of the recovery in semiconductor unit prices.",
        "Looking at external conditions, the member viewed that the trade account recorded a surplus for two months in a row in June and July, led by an increase in exports of automobiles and vessels, and the decline in imports owing to falling energy prices.",
        "The member forecast that, if the sluggishness in the IT sector is eased going forward, the decrease in exports would decelerate and external conditions would improve.",
        "The member added that, in the process, it would be necessary to respond more effectively to the trend of global supply chain reorganization.",
        "The member noted that the current account switched to a surplus in May, recording a surplus of 2.44 billion dollars in the first half, and, according to the Bank of Korea forecast, it would post a surplus of 27 billion dollars for the year.",
        "The member stated that entering this year, private consumption had shown signs of recovery on the back of pent-up demand, but that consumption regarding outside activities, such as food, accommodation, and travel, was sluggish due to the longer-than-usual rainy season and in particular considerable precipitation in May and July.",
        "The member anticipated that going forward private consumption would recover modestly, considering the favorable employment conditions and the consumer composite sentiment index.",
        "The member also noted that consumer price inflation in July recorded prices and the base effect from last year, but that it would rebound again after August.",
        "The member mentioned that core inflation had continued to slow, but that uncertainties remained along the future inflation path regarding international oil price developments, the extent of any increase in public utility charges, such as subway and bus fares, and developments in grain and food prices affected by the Russia-Ukraine war.",
        "In terms of the employment situation, the member commented that the employment and unemployment rates remained robust with the number of persons employed in July increasing by 211,000, led by those aged 60 or older and by women, but that the scale of the increase was the lowest in 29 months.",
        "The member pointed out that this was attributable to the decline in the number of persons employed in the agricultural, forestry & fisheries sector and to the decline in the number of day laborers affected by torrential rains, in addition to the fall in the number of persons employed in the manufacturing and construction industries.",
        "The member forecast that, going forward the employment market would continue to grow driven by the services sector, but that the extent of any increase in the number of persons employed would narrow in-line with the trend of a slowdown in employment in the construction and manufacturing industries.",
        "The member noted that, with respect to financial markets, volatility in the stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets had heightened due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and due to stress in the Chinese real estate market.",
        "The member saw that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had been fluctuating at the 1,300 won range of late, and that it was expected to stabilize downward in the future due to factors such as a recovery in exports.",
        "The member commented that household loans in the financial sector had been increasing for four consecutive months, leading to a rise in household debt, which raised growing concerns that this would pose constraints on future economic operations and threaten financial stability.",
        "The member saw that, this year, the volume of apartment transactions had been steadily increasing, leading to an increase in mortgage loans and household debt.",
        "Therefore, going forward the member emphasized the need for more careful management to prevent the household debt-to-GDP ratio from rising.",
        "In addition, the member stated that corporate loans in July increased by 8.7 trillion won, indicating a continuing upward trend.",
        "The member thus demanded that corporate debt be managed, together with household debt, which was at one of the higest levels in the world.",
        "The member noted that, taking into account the conditions surrounding the Base Rate decision for the moment, there was a mix of upside and downside factors at play.",
        "The member stated that, while inflation was on a downward trend, it was expected to exceed the target level for a considerable period.",
        "The member also saw that risks in vulnerable areas, such as real estate project financing, had not been resolved.",
        "The member commented that the economy was somewhat easing from its slump, but that it had not entered a full-fledged recovery phase yet, and household debt was on an increasing trend.",
        "The member added that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate was fluctuating at around the mid-1,300 won level, and that the tightening stance in major countries would likely persist for some time, as there was a possibility of further rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "In overall consideration of the above mentioned situations, the member suggested that the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level of 3.50%.",
        "The member also saw the need to make decisions on matters, including whether to proceed with an additional rate hike, while examining certain factors between now and the next meeting, like trends in core inflation, developments in financial markets, including the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate, the extent of household debt growth, the pace of recovery in the real economy, including the real estate market, and decisions concerning monetary policies in the U.S. and other major countries.",
        "Another member also expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had exhibited more favorable growth than expected in the first half of the year, but forecast that downward pressure on the growth path would likely increase due mainly to the cumulative impact of monetary tightening and the possibility of a sluggish recovery in the Chinese economy.",
        "Concerning the U.S. economy, the member stated that there were growing expectations of a soft-landing of the U.S. economy based on continued strong consumption and employment, and that inflation had continued to slow.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that, since the main factors behind the decline in inflation so far, such as supply chain improvements and declines in global oil and commodity prices, had disappeared, inflation going forward would likely be dependent heavily on employment conditions and wage growth.",
        "The member assessed that, as the recent robust U.S. employment situation had been working to limit any decline in service sector prices, there was significant uncertainty regarding potential further declines in inflation, given the large share of the service sector in the U.S. economy.",
        "The member added that, in this regard, there were strengthened market expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve maintaining its monetary tightening stance for a longer period than initially forecast.",
        "With regard to China, the member pointed out that the Chinese economy had been experiencing weakening recovery momentum, affected by a slowdown in exports resulting from sluggish overseas demand.",
        "The member added that economic uncertainties had increased significantly due to the sluggishness of the real estate market.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member assessed that, although the sluggishness in exports had eased somewhat, uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the maintained economic recovery had increased, with consumption recovery slowing and investment remaining sluggish.",
        "The member commented that employment conditions had been generally consistent with the original forecast, but that the pace of growth in the number of persons newly employed had been slowing, and that these new employees consisted mainly of the elderly and women, and, finally, that they had been mostly hired in the service sector.",
        "The member projected that, despite the factors mentioned above, GDP growth for this year would be similar to the previous forecast, boosted by a recovery in exports in-line with the recovery in the global IT industry and also by inflows of Chinese tour groups.",
        "The member however assessed that downward pressure on the future growth path had been strengthening owing to persistently high domestic and external uncertainties, and particularly due to factors such as the sluggish recovery in the Chinese economy and rising U.S. Treasury bond yields.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member judged that consumer price inflation and core inflation had slowed, affected heavily by the base-period effect.",
        "Going forward, the member assessed that consumer price inflation had the possibility to rebound to the 3% range after the base-period effect dissipates, and that core inflation was expected to continue to slow at a moderate pace.",
        "However, the member added that uncertainties still existed owing to international oil price trends and weather conditions.",
        "The member saw that, in financial markets, expectations of a prolonged tightening stance by the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with shifts in supply-demand conditions for U.S. long-term Treasury bonds, had resulted in a significant rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.",
        "The member added that this had led to a synchronization with long-term government bond yields in Korea, further strengthening the degree of tightening of financial conditions.",
        "The member added that, owing to the anticipation of housing price increases, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area, there had been a notable expansion in household loans, primarily in mortgage loans.",
        "The member projected that, considering the strong likelihood of ongoing tightening in the U.S. financial landscape over an extended period and the growing potential for prolonged tightening within the domestic financial setting due to the interest rate co-movement of South Korea and the U.S., the risk per unit of household debt had increased.",
        "However, the member commented that in order to effectively address the accumulated household debt, it would be desirable to assess not only the overall quantity of household debt, but also its qualitative aspects, including evaluations of risk weighted HH debt amounts based on the distribution of DSR.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that while the sudden withdrawal issue at certain non-bank financial institutions seemed to be resolved, delinquency rates at both banks and non-bank financial institutions were still on the rise.",
        "The member emphasized the importance of thorough preparations to avoid any potential spillover from problems in vulnerable sectors to wider financial system instability.",
        "Looking at the domestic foreign exchange market, the member noted that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen significantly.",
        "The member added that this was driven by several factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar due to strengthened expectations of prolonged tightening at the U.S. Federal Reserve, uncertainties surrounding the recovery in the Chinese economy, and the potential decrease in the U.S. dollar supply from a supply-demand perspective.",
        "However, the member judged that, considering the significant scale of the Korean economy's net foreign financial assets and foreign exchange reserves, excessive market intervention or policy responses in terms of monetary policy were deemed undesirable.",
        "Considering these economic and financial conditions at home and abroad, the member judged that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member expressed the view that it would be important to thoroughly assess the direction and scale of any additional adjustments to interest rates, while closely monitoring how factors like growth, inflation, and the conditions of domestic and international financial markets would develop compared to the projected trajectory.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.50% at the meeting.",
        "The member stated that recent domestic and overseas economic developments and outlooks appeared to be similar to those during the July meeting.",
        "The member argued that, despite rapid policy rate hikes, the U.S. economy had continued to grow, bolstered by a strong labor market and consumption, resulting in a higher likelihood of a soft-landing.",
        "The member mentioned that the Chinese economy had been recovering at a slowerthan-expected pace due to the country’s real estate slump and sluggish exports, while economies in the euro area had been showing weak recoveries due to the sluggishness of the manufacturing sector there, in spite of a recovery in tourism.",
        "The member added that the Japanese economy had been emerging from a decades-long recession and showing some recovery, but there seemed to be some uncertainty regarding its sustainability going forward.",
        "The member noted that global trade had remained sluggish, probably due to the fact that the global economic recovery since last year had been driven primarily by the services sector, and went on to state that global oil prices had risen, boosted by the extension of production cuts by OPEC+.",
        "The member added that inflation in major countries had been slowing, but that it would take a considerable period of time for inflation to stabilize at the target level.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy had continued to slow but, although the economy had been somewhat sluggish due to recent climate factors, consumption had continued to recover and the sluggishness in exports had been easing somewhat.",
        "The member indicated that the semiconductor industry appeared to be bottoming out, boosted by production cuts at major suppliers and by AI-related demand.",
        "The member stated that employment had been more favorable than initially projected, although the pace of growth in the number of persons employed had continued to slow gradually.",
        "The member mentioned that housing prices had recently shifted to an increase and that the pace of growth in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area had been accelerating.",
        "The member added that consumer price inflation had slowed considerably due to the base-period effect, but that it was likely to accelerate again starting in August, and the member went on to state that the slowdown in core inflation had been less pronounced than originally expected.",
        "The member assessed that the financial and FX markets had continued to ease overall, while showing high volatility owing to concerns about prolonged monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and risks involving China’s real estate sector.",
        "The member judged that Treasury bond yields had declined substantially and then risen again recently, affected by a rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields, which followed concerns about prolonged monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and a possible worsening of Treasury bond supply conditions, and the member added that short-term interest rates had declined, influenced by a rise in MMF deposit-taking.",
        "The member argued that it was time to stay on alert against the recent expansion in the extent of growth in household loans in-line with domestic real estate price movements, and also against the accelerating growth in corporate loans.",
        "The member added that deliquency rates at banks and non-banks had been rising steadily and that a close watch should still be needed on whether certain non-bank financial institutions would remain stable.",
        "The member stated that, considering all this, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at 3.50% at this meeting.",
        "The member mentioned that, since uncertainties remained high regarding FX market developments in-line with monetary policy trends in major countries, and also regarding the consumer price inflation and core inflation paths toward the target, the possibility of further rate increases should be left open.",
        "At the October 19 Monetary Policy Board meeting, each member expressed their opinion on the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate decision.",
        "All members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "Concerning the global economy, the member noted that the U.S. economy had maintained growth based on favorable employment and consumption and that the euro economic recovery had been subdued owing to sluggish indicators related to production and consumption amid persistent high inflation and high interest rates.",
        "The member commented that in China, while economic indicators had been improving somewhat, boosted by the government’s stimulus measures, the economic recovery was expected to be modest due to a slump in its real estate market and the continued downward trend of its exports.",
        "The member added that the Japanese economy showed faster-than-expected growth, driven by the rise in automobile exports and the arrival of foreign tourists, more than offsetting sluggish domestic demand.",
        "Regarding the Korean economy, the member assessed that its slowdown had been easing in-line with a gradual recovery in exports, and those of semiconductors in particular, and added that uncertainties exist surrounding the future growth path involving the recovery pace of the semiconductor industry, the extent of the Chinese economic recovery, and the direction of the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "Looking at external conditions, the member viewed that exports, having shown a downward trend since October last year, had continued to recover gradually and that the decrease in exports had been decelerating accordingly, and went on to forecast that exports would shift to a year-on-year increase in October.",
        "The member noted that the trade account had recorded a surplus for four months in a row since June, led by an increase in exports of automobiles and vessels and a decline in energy imports.",
        "The member also stated that the current account switched to a surplus in May, recording a surplus of 10.98 billion dollars until August, but that the recently heightened uncertainties surrounding international oil prices would likely affect the scale of any future current account surplus.",
        "The member commented that the index of all industry production grew by 2.2% in August, led by the semiconductor industry, while private consumption growth had been slowing, influenced by sluggish commodity consumption.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation in September recorded 3.7%, up from a month earlier, driven by a rise in agricultural product and food prices, and added that core inflation excluding food and energy remained unchanged from the previous month’s 3.3%.",
        "The member assessed that uncertainties remained along the future inflation path regarding international oil price and exchange rate trends related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and to domestic and overseas economic developments.",
        "The member assessed that the employment situation is robust in that the employment and unemployment rates are reaching a record high and a record low, respetively, and that the number of persons employed in September increased by 309,000 year-on-year, driven by a rise in the number of persons employed in the construction sector for the first time in 10 months.",
        "The member however pointed out that those aged 60 or older, who are responsible for the majority of the growth seen in employment figures, and a decline in the number of persons employed in the manufacturing industry were both challenges to the labor market.",
        "The member also mentioned that the number of young people employed had been falling for 11 months in a row, affected by a shrinking population.",
        "The member commented that market interest rates and the exchange rate had risen greatly and that volatility had expanded in financial markets due to strengthened expectations of prolonged tightening monetary policy stances in major countries and to a strong U.S. dollar.",
        "The member noted that the Israel-Hamas conflict was affecting financial markets with some time lag, and could deliver a big shock depending on its future developments.",
        "The member stated that the increase in household loans had declined greatly in September affected by temporary factors, but demanded that household loans be managed so that an increase in household loans and a subsequent rise in household debt do not undermine financial stability, as household loans had continued to increase for six consecutive months since April, and as the size of those loans could possibly be larger in October than in September.",
        "The member also stressed the need to deleverage corporate debt in order to reduce the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio, which stood higher than it was during the Asian Financial Crisis.",
        "The member assessed that, as for the real estate market, uncertainties regarding the future direction of the housing market had heightened considering downside factors such as stronger lending regulations and a rise in lending rates, as well as an upward trend of housing sale transactions in-line with strengthened expectations of a rise in housing prices this year.",
        "Looking at conditions surrounding the Base Rate decision, the member commented that inflation was forecast to be above the target level for a considerable time, and that the increase in household debt had not moderated, with risks in vulnerable sectors, such as real estate project financing, not being resolved.",
        "The member added that the trend of higher interest rates had been persisting for a considerable time due to a prolongation of tightening monetary policy stances in major countries, and that uncertainties surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict were elevated.",
        "Therefore, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current decision at the next meeting regarding whether the Base Rate needs to be raised further, all while monitoring developments of the Israel-Hamas conflict, global oil price and core inflation trends, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate, household debt trends, the extent of any recovery in the real economy, including the real estate market, and monetary policies in the U.S. and other major countries.",
        "Another member judged that it was appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that despite the generally solid growth of the global economy, growth trends differed across countries and that growth would slow gradually going forward.",
        "The member observed that the combination of short-term factors, such as the prospect of prolonged tightening monetary policy stances in major countries and continued high interest rates, and structural factors, such as the decline in international investment and in supply chain efficiency resulting from geopolitical conflict, excessive debt, demographic shifts, and climate change, may cause economic players to be pessimistic about the future outlook, suppressing private consumption and investment for some time.",
        "The member noted that inflation in major economies was likely to slow gradually going forward, although uncertainties remained high given the movements in international oil prices amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy showed a modest recovery, as the export slump had eased, despite a slow consumption recovery.",
        "The member stated that private consumption had recovered moderately, as the modest recovery in services consumption driven by improved weather conditions, long holidays, and the increase in foreign tourist arrivals, had been offset by sluggish goods consumption.",
        "The member added that facilities investment remained in a slump, while sluggish construction investment had alleviated modestly due to the resumption of construction, which had been delayed due to unfavorable weather conditions.",
        "The member observed that exports had improved, led mainly by semiconductor exports, and that labor market conditions had remained generally solid with a low unemployment rate, despite the moderately slowing growth in the number of persons employed.",
        "The member mentioned that the outlook for the property market remained unclear, given that the transaction volume had decreased somewhat despite the continuing rise in housing prices mainly in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation was likely to stand above the August forecast affected by the rise in international oil prices and the unfavorable weather conditions, and that core inflation and inflation expectations had remained subdued for the past three months.",
        "The member expected that prices would be affected by movements in international oil prices and in exchange rates, and by economic conditions at home and abroad, and that the pace of increase would slow gradually, although upside risks seemed larger at present.",
        "In terms of financial and foreign exchange markets, the member observed that volatility had increased, driven by the outlook for a tighter-for-longer monetary policy in major countries.",
        "The member noted that long-term treasury bond yields had inreased, affected by the rise in treasury yields in major countries, while short-term interest rates had risen driven by banks’ increased issuance of short-term bonds.",
        "The member also noted that the Korean won to the U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen considerably, due to expectations for a prolonged tightening stance at the U.S. Fed and to the strong dollar.",
        "The member stated that the growth in household debt had slowed in September compared to the previous month due to seasonal reasons, while the sharp growth in housing-related loans had continued, and corporate borrowing had significantly increased driven by demand for funds and by more aggressive lending operations at banks, in addition to some seasonal factors.",
        "The member assessed that both drivers for a further Base Rate hike and for a freeze were present under the current domestic and global circumstances.",
        "In the member’s view, the steady growth in household and corporate borrowing indicated that monetary and credit policies had not been as tightening as intended.",
        "The member cited the stagnant slowing of core inflation and public inflation expectations over the past three months, the exchange rate movement affected by the U.S. policy rate outlook, and the larger-than-expected upside pressures on inflation as drivers for a further Base Rate hike, which called for an additional pre-emptive rate hike to achieve a speedy return to the inflation target.",
        "In contrast, the member mentioned that certain other factors -- including the sluggish growth rate, the unclear recovery in domestic and overseas demand, the prospect of slowing inflation with gradually stabilizing international oil prices and exchange rates, rising delinquency rates among non-bank financial institutions, and the potential financial market risk -- would indicate a rate freeze, and that a monitoring of future developments would be more appropriate.",
        "In overall consideration of the fact that the considerable rise in shortand long-term market interest rates had practically brought a stronger tightening effect on financial markets, that financial supervisory authorities had become more alert about the household debt growth, and that uncertainties had grown over global economic environments due to the escalated tension in the Middle East, the member deemed it appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level and to further monitor domestic and global economic developments and monetary policy changes in major countries before considering any need for an additional rate hike.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50%.",
        "The member mentioned changes in the domestic and international economic environments after the previous MPB meeting.",
        "First, looking at the global economy, the member assessed that, while the growth trend had differentiated across major economies and as inflation had continued to moderate in its underlying trend, uncertainty had increased overall due to a prolongation of tightening monetary policy stances in advanced countries and heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "The member noted that, despite expectations of high interest rates for longer, the U.S. economy maintained strong growth, exceeding its potential level, boosted by a decreased sensitivity of the economy to interest rates in-line with reduced private debt and a higher share of fixed rate loans since the Global Financial Crisis, and by expanded private investment in new growth industries.",
        "The member commented that the euro area, meanwhile, had been showing a modest economic recovery, owing to the sluggishness of manufacturing exports and domestic demand, offsetting a recovery in tourism demand.",
        "The member added that the Chinese economy had been in a structural decline, particularly in the real estate sector.",
        "The member judged that there was a mix of upside and downside risks to domestic economic growth.",
        "The member assessed that exports had been showing a faster-than-expected recovery, driven by growth in semiconductor exports and a slower decline in exports to China since September.",
        "The member forecast that exports would sustain their robust growth next year, mainly in the semiconductor sector.",
        "The member also anticipated that facilities investment and fiscal expenditures would make a greater contribution to growth compared to this year, boosted by growth in semiconductor investment demand and a rise in tax revenue.",
        "The member expected that private consumption, on the other hand, would see its growth momentum weaken compared to the past average due to the combined effects of increased household debt repayment burdens and weakening propensity for consumption following an aging population, which would more than offset any improvements in real purchasing power in-line with slower inflation.",
        "Concerning inflation, meanwhile, the member assessed that upside risks outweighed downside risks.",
        "The member added that this was because supply-side inflationary pressures had recently increased to a greater extent than expected due to rising oil prices and to the exchange rate, and, if the situation in the Middle East worsens, there was a significant risk of a further rise in oil prices and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar simultaneously.",
        "The member argued that the fact that demand-side pressures were weak might limit businesses from passing on cost increases, but, if multiple supply shocks accumulate in a situation of persistently high inflation expectations, it would become challenging to rule out the possibility of inflation risk escalating once more and the timing of inflation converging on the target level being delayed.",
        "Looking at financial markets, the member mentioned that long-term market interest rates and the won-dollar exchange rate had risen significantly, affected by expectations of an extension of the U.S. Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy stance, but that markets had not become as unstable as in the previous year thanks to enhanced supply and demand conditions in the bond and FX swap markets, and to improved capacities of the private and government sectors to cope with the situation.",
        "The member, however, assessed that, despite accumulated Base Rate hikes, household and corporate lending had maintained strong growth, mainly in real estate mortgage loans, and added that its negative side effects had been building up, such as worsening financial imbalances and a consequent risk of financial system instability, a weakening demand capacity, and an inefficient allocation of resources.",
        "The member argued that, considering heightened upside risks to inflation and the buildup of financial imbalances amid increased economic uncertainties at home and abroad, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting, while the possibility of further rate increases should be left open.",
        "The member also stated that it would be necessary to employ various policy instruments, such as monetary policy, macroprudential policy, and structural reform policy in a coordinated and consistent manner in order to ease conflicts among multiple policy goals, including growth, inflation, and financial stability.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member noted that the global economy showed more favorable growth than expected, particularly in the U.S.",
        "However, the member assessed that downside risks had increased due to the impact of the ongoing tightening monetary policies in major economies, the increased geopolitical risks resulting from the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the possibility of a slowdown in the Chinese economy.",
        "The member saw that, in the U.S., the economy exhibited strong growth thanks to robust consumption and employment conditions, and that inflation was falling slowly, prompting a longer duration of the Federal Reserve's tightening policy stance than initially expected.",
        "The member judged that consumer price inflation was highly likely to fall slowly going forward, as employment still remained robust, and as service sector inflation was declining slowly.",
        "The member stated that, in the case of China, the government stimulus policy measures had temporarily alleviated the economic downturn, but uncertainties persisted regarding the sustainability of the recovery due to downside factors, such as deepening sluggishness in the real estate market and a continued export slowdown stemming from sluggish overseas demand.",
        "The member noted that, in the euro area, economic growth remained weak, particularly due to a struggling manufacturing sector, and that the prolonged tightening policy stance as a response to persistently high inflation would likely have a negative impact on the real economy in the future.",
        "In assessing the domestic economy, the member saw that there were growing uncertainties in policy conditions due to the expansion of downside risks to growth and in upside risks to inflation stemming from heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "The member stated that there was an increased possibility that the growth forecasts for this year and the next would fall slightly short of the August forecasts, primarily due to weaker-than-expected private consumption.",
        "The member noted that, on the labor market, the pace of growth in the number of persons newly employed and the rate of growth in regular workers’ fixed wages had been slowing moderately, and that the number of persons newly employed continued to increase, particularly among the elderly and among women.",
        "The member presented the view that, along the future growth trajectory, downside factors would appear to be predominant, including the potential for further increases in international oil prices due to heightened geopolitical risks, a weakening recovery in private consumption, and a possible weakening of external demand resulting from prolonged tightening stances in major economies.",
        "However, the member saw that there would also be the possibility of an upward adjustment in the forecast path depending on the pace of recovery in the global IT industry.",
        "The member thus found the situation highly uncertain.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation exceeded expectations in September, impacted by rises in agricultural product prices and by international oil prices, and upside risks had increased due to a possible further increase in international oil prices following future developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "The member expected core inflation to continue a gradual slowing trend going forward, but uncertainty remained regarding the pace of slowing due, for instance, to secondary spillover effects resulting from accumulated cost pressures and the possibility of hikes in public utility charges.",
        "The member observed that an increase in long-term U.S. interest rates had pushed up domestic long-term rates, which leads to further tightening financial conditions.",
        "Nonetheless, the member pointed out that corporate borrowing had grown sharply, so that the growth trend should be monitored closely going forward.",
        "Noting the continued growth in household borrowing, the member stated that for more effective control, authorities should take a qualitative approach, focusing on the risk of household debt instead of on the total debt amount, and that a comprehensive risk management system to assess and control household debt risk was needed.",
        "On domestic foreign exchange markets, the member remarked that the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had fluctuated at around its annual peak.",
        "The member judged that the fluctuation was driven primarily by changes in expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and of movements in the U.S. dollar index, rather than by domestic factors, and therefore did not warrant a monetary policy response.",
        "However the member added that caution was still needed so that any increase in volatility due to intensifying geopolitical risk would not lead to any financial market unrest.",
        "The member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the above-mentioned domestic and global economic and financial conditions, it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period, and then determine whether any additional tightening or easing would be necessary in the future, based on the monitoring of domestic and global financial market developments, and trends in growth and inflation.",
        "Another member also presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member stated that the global economy was displaying varying growth trends from country to country and that it was gradually slowing.",
        "The member commented that, despite the intensive policy tightening so far, the U.S. was maintaining stronger-than-expected growth, bolstered by favorable employment conditions and solid consumption.",
        "However, the member saw that, in a situation in which it would be unavoidable to expand government bond issuance to address the accumulated fiscal deficits, robust economic indicators and persistent inflation concerns were increasing the possibility of the Federal Reserve's “higher for longer” stance.",
        "The member noted that China was exhibiting a weaker-than-expected recovery trend despite its government stimulus measures.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that with the global goods trade still in a slump, the outbreak of a Middle East conflict had further heightened external uncertainties.",
        "The member saw that the impact of the armed conflict in the Middle East remained limited for now, but that it would be very difficult to gauge future developments and potential ramifications for the global economy.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the conflict could lead to repercussions, such as increases in international oil prices, an exchange rate depreciation, or supply chain disruptions, thus constraining growth and inflation, and increasing instability in international financial markets through heightened risk aversion.",
        "The member thus saw the need to pay close attention to relevant developments there in the future.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy exhibited growth in-line with expectations thanks to a recovery in semiconductor exports, despite weak improvements in private consumption and in facilities investment.",
        "However, the member pointed out that consumer price inflation had risen significantly, reaching the mid- to upper 3% range of late, surpassing initial projections, driven by sharp increases in oil and agricultural product prices.",
        "The member saw that core inflation had remained at 3.3% for the third consecutive month, indicating a slower pace of disinflation compared to the past.",
        "The member added that the uncertainty regarding the timing of any price target convergence had increased, influenced by the situation in the Middle East.",
        "The member presented the view that, fortunately, the labor market maintained a strong recovery trend despite these conditions.",
        "The member saw that, in the financial sector, the volatility of price variables (interest rates and exchange rates) had expanded somewhat, reflecting expectations of prolonged monetary tightening.",
        "The member stated that household debt in the financial sector saw a decrease in its growth due to temporary factors, such as write-offs and sales of loans at the end of the quarter, but that housing-related loans still maintained high growth, in the range of 6 trillion won per month.",
        "The member argued that, given the relatively lax regulations on real estate, comparatively low mortgage rates, and the possibility that the general public was perceiving housing prices as being at a low point, household debt growth could expand again.",
        "Therefore, the member pointed out that deleveraging efforts should be sustained by strengthening the management of household debt by the government while maintaining a high-interest rate policy.",
        "The member presented the view that the domestic and international conditions facing our economy were challenging.",
        "The member noted that an additional interest rate hike could not be ruled out, in the midst of the expected prolonged period of high interest rates in major economies.",
        "The member saw that the real economy had seen an increase in downside risks to growth and in upside risks to prices, and that heightened geopolitical tensions had increased concern in financial markets.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, given the significantly increased uncertainty in the current situation, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% and to prepare for the potential impact of future domestic and international developments and to prepare policy changes for the domestic economy.",
        "Another member expressed that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member stated that global economic growth had been slowing overall, albeit differentiated from country to country, and that this trend of a growth slowdown was forecast to continue, affected by a prolongation of tightening monetary policy stances in major countries.",
        "The member added that inflation in major advanced countries had continued to moderate in its underlying trend, mainly on core inflation, but that it still remained above the target level, and that uncertainties regarding the price trend had risen due, for example, to greater volatility in international oil prices stemming from the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "The member noted that in global financial markets, long-term government bond yields in major advanced countries had risen greatly, especially U.S. Treasury bond yields, and that the U.S. dollar had strengthened considerably amid expanded volatility in major price variables.",
        "The member pointed out that domestic economic growth had continued improving at a modest pace as the sluggishness in exports had eased while the recovery in private consumption had slowed somewhat.",
        "The member forecasted that the domestic economy would continue to improve going forward.",
        "However, the member added that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path were judged to be high, influenced by the timing of any recovery in the semiconductor industry, geopolitical risks, and the impacts of prolonged tightening monetary policy in major countries.",
        "The member stated that the moderating trend in inflation had slowed.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the mid- to upper global oil and agricultural products, while core inflation had remained unchanged since July.",
        "The member forecasted that the slowing trend in inflation would resume going forward, but that close attention should be paid to its timing and pace as the timing of inflation converging on the target level was more likely to be delayed than previously expected.",
        "The member commented that there were elevated uncertainties along the future inflation path regarding geopolitical risks, global oil price movements, exchange rate trends, and economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The member stated that in financial markets, interest rates had risen sharply, particularly in long-term bonds, and that interest rate volatility had heightened, affected by higher volatility in global financial markets and by the rise in long-term government bond yields in major advanced countries.",
        "The member noted that housing-related loans had continued to increase, although the overall increase in household loans had slowed in September.",
        "The member judged that liquidity risk in the non-banking sector was seemingly subsiding, but emphasized the need to be attentive to relevant credit risks, considering rising loan deliquency rates, the slump in regional real estate markets, and elevated interest rate levels.",
        "The member commented that in FX markets, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had remained high with its volatility expanded.",
        "The member stressed the need to closely monitor FX market trends, as the market would be greatly affected by a strong U.S. dollar and by geopolitical risks.",
        "In summary, the member stated that although inflation was forecast to resume its moderating trend, it would be necessary to closely examine what impacts changes in external conditions and Base Rate hikes so far would have on the overall economy, as uncertainties surrounding policy conditions at home and abroad had heightened due to, for example, the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
        "The member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 3.50% for this meeting.",
        "The member emphasized that the possibility of maintaining a tightening policy stance for longer than originally expected had increased, considering recent upside risks in inflation.",
        "The member stated that an additional rate hike would be needed if the possibility of an inflation slowdown being delayed more than previously forecast increased significantly due to the realization of upside risks in inflation."

    "2015": [
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic growth in the US had been sustained, with the nation’s consumption and facilities investment increasing and its housing market and employment situation improving, that the modest improvements in the euro area were continuing, driven by domestic demand, and that China’s economic growth was continuing to slow down, with its exports declining.",
        "Members also judged that international financial market volatility had heightened, due for example to the divergence in major countries’ policy stances.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members assessed that, although domestic demand had sustained its pace of recovery, driven by consumption, the trend of declining exports also had persisted.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, most members noted that long-term interest rates had risen, owing mainly to increases in interest rates in major countries and to increased bank debenture issuance, and that stock prices had fallen, affected for example by the global stock price decline and net stock selling by foreign investors.",
        "They commented that the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, influenced by strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "In addition, a number of members noted that bank household lending had sustained its high rate of increase.",
        "With regard to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had stood at 1.0 percent, up from the previous month, due mainly to greater increases in industrial product prices and services fees, and that core inflation had also increased slightly from the preceding month.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member put forward the view that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5% for the month.",
        "The member went on to note that the decision in November 2015 to include the yuan in the SDR currency basket was a consequence of the Chinese government’s phase-in implementation of its medium-to-long-term plan to make the yuan an international currency.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, considering the scales of the Korean economy and trade, and the degree of its capital market openness, it was time for Korea to actively consider making the won an international currency, and thus, with the establishment of the won-yuan direct trading market in Shanghai, China scheduled for 2016, Korea should develop a medium-to-long-term plan to push the successful internationalization of the won, and continue its efforts to improve its financial and economic conditions and systems.",
        "Another member mentioned that, although the trends for inflation and the domestic economy remained overall on the path forecast last October, uncertainties surrounding the future outlook remained very high, due mainly to a slowdown in the recovery of external demand and to the possibility of further declines in oil prices, and that it was also necessary to observe what kind of influence the US Fed rate hike would have on international financial markets.",
        "The member then argued that, while keeping the Base Rate at its current level, the Bank of Korea should keep a constant watch on financial market conditions to prevent market unrest from spreading, and strengthen its efforts to bring about market stability if necessary.",
        "The member also noted that, although the number of persons employed had steadily grown, the quality of employment conditions had remained inadequate, and thus it was necessary to draw up more practical measures on the youth employment problem by addressing it not only from the perspective of the total number of persons employed, but also strengthening the micro-level analysis of the issue in terms of occupation and sector.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and prepare for the Fed’s rate hike, as growth and inflation were not deviating significantly from the path originally forecast, but uncertainty and potential risks seemed to have increased even further during the fourth quarter.",
        "In support of this, the member stated that, first, the downside risks to the growth path had been increasing gradually with recovery in aggregate demand and production somewhat weakening, which more than offset the sustained moderate trend of improvement in economic activities led by consumption; second, based on various core inflation indicators, inflation generally remained on the path forecast last October, with its underlying upward trend accelerating at a modest pace; and third, slack in the manufacturing sector had increased and recovery in the labor market had been slowing.",
        "The member further stated that, as the current US rate hike cycle would differ from previous instances in that it would occur in the midst of economic downturns in EMEs, during which their financial cycles were coupling excessively with those of AEs and a large amount of global liquidity – mostly securities investment funds - flowed into them, the possibility could not be ruled out that the rate hike’s repercussions would be larger than expected.",
        "The member went on to argue that domestic macroeconomic policies should be implemented in ways that would offset downward pressures resulting from slowed external demand with a recovery in domestic demand and, at the same time, attention needed to be paid to the widening imbalances in the financial system from a medium-to-long-term perspective.",
        "Meanwhile, one member stated that, taking into overall consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, the downside risks to growth and prices were seen to have increased somewhat compared with the path forecast last October, but the economic upturn was likely to continue, and in terms of financial stability, risks seemed to have grown even further, with the possibility of greater financial market volatility in line with a shift in the US Fed’s monetary policy direction and with household debt expected to maintain strong growth for a considerable period of time, boosted chiefly by low interest rates and increased extensions of apartment group loans.",
        "The member also presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and closely examine the effect of changes in domestic and external conditions, and of a shift in the Fed’s monetary policy in particular, on the international financial markets and domestic foreign exchange and financial markets.",
        "Another member set out the view that, in overall consideration of recent economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and closely monitor the Fed’s interest rate policy and its impact, Chinese economic developments, international oil prices, improvement in domestic demand and slowdown in exports in the Korean economy, and fluctuations in the Korean foreign exchange and financial markets.",
        "The member also stated that if the Fed’s rate hike leads to a decoupling of major countries’ monetary policies, this might give rise to substantial volatility in Korea’s financial and foreign exchange markets, which are presently vulnerable to external shocks.",
        "The member also asked the policy authorities to be fully prepared to take appropriate market stabilization measures in a timely manner if needed.",
        "The member then assessed the Korean economy as facing an unprecedented downward trend of exports as downside risks to the global economy reached a new level, and went on to add that there had arisen an even stronger need for the policy authorities to seek the optimal mix of monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies in an effort to enhance economic dynamism while easing the problem of excessive debt and risks of herd behavior in the financial and foreign exchange markets, which served as major factors liming active macroeconomic policy implementation.",
        "One other member set out the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, the government should work to maintain the trend of improvement in domestic demand while paying attention to the risks inherent in global economic trends and in the divergence of major advanced countries’ policy stances.",
        "The member stressed that, in order to make an accurate diagnosis of and cope with persistently low growth, the government should note difficulties on the supply side as well as a shortage of demand, and focus on investment expansion to increase the economy’s production capacity, thereby restoring growth and employment potential.",
        "The member mentioned a number of areas that merit consideration and examination, including the effects of weakening oil and commodity prices on exports, growth and prices generally; preparations for the Fed’s rate hike; changes in the term and risk premiums in the bond markets and their impact; changes in foreign investment trends; market stabilization measures to prepare against possible foreign exchange liquidity disturbances; and the positive and/or negative effects of the yuan’s inclusion in the SDR on the Korean economy.",
        "The member went on to argue that financial market stability needed to be strengthened, for example by enhancing the financial sector’s liquidity management capacity, as minor changes surrounding the financial markets caused by financial frictions, including information asymmetry and herd behavior, might trigger or worsen credit or liquidity risks.",
        "With regard to inflation targeting, the member noted that the central bank should set its inflation target within the larger framework of its monetary policy, and that it needed to cope flexibly with price determinant variables and also strengthen communication.",
        "The member then emphasized that capital flows should be improved to facilitate the investment needed for the recovery of growth potential, and stated that a major task to this end included enhancing the effectiveness of the bank intermediation support facility.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued.",
        "Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due for example to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.",
        "activities have sustained their paces of recovery, driven by consumption, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the improvement in economic agents’ sentiments has been inadequate.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has increased steadily, and in October the unemployment rate fell compared to that in October of last year while the employment-to-population ratio maintained the same level.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",
        "in November, due mainly to a narrowing of the scale of decline in petroleum product prices and to expansions in the extents of increase in service fees.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 2.4%, from 2.3% in October.",
        "Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices.",
        "In the housing market, meanwhile, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have persisted in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices have fallen, long-term market interest rates have risen, and the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "growth, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy or in economic conditions in emerging market countries including China, the movements of capital flows, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, although the U.S. had maintained favorable growth, the trends of recovery in the euro area and Japan had been weak and economic growth in China had continued to slow.",
        "Members also judged that risk aversion in the international financial markets had heightened, and that the U.S. dollar had continued to strengthen.",
        "As to the domestic economy, many members noted that growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 had not been strong, due mainly to contractions in consumption and construction investment.",
        "Some members asserted that the trend of future economic recovery was being maintained, even though the growth forecast for 2015 had been adjusted downward due to the sluggishness during Q4 2014.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members pointed out that stock prices had declined, long-term market interest rates had fallen back after having risen, and household lending had increased considerably for the third consecutive month.",
        "With regard to prices, members mentioned that the rate of consumer price inflation was 0.8%, lower than in the preceding month, affected chiefly by the fall in international oil prices.",
        "Some members called for attention to be paid going forward to the trend of inflation expectations, which was on a downward path.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and their future outlooks, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member observed that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and added that careful watch should be kept on the future trends of changes in downside risks to the global economy, on the trends of exports and domestic demand, on the possibility of entrenchment of low inflation, on changes in international oil prices and their effects, on both qualitative and quantitative household debt trends, and on fluctuations in the Korean won exchange rate and in foreign capital flows.",
        "Another member stated that, when financial and economic conditions at home and abroad were looked at comprehensively, on the external front the paces of economic improvement were weak in major countries apart from the U.S., and risk aversion related to the sharp fall in international oil prices was rising, while domestically the economy was showing signs of a slowdown in the pace of improvement in economic activity due to somewhat lackluster real economic indicators.",
        "He went on to express his opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and added that, while trying to take into account growth and price-related risks along with risks to financial stability in a balanced way, amid the uncertainties stemming from changes in global conditions, preparations should be made to enable a timely future policy response.",
        "One other member commented that, while the negative output gap was now expected to widen, and the time of its closing to also be delayed as the fourth quarter 2014 GDP growth rate had been below expectations, the negative inflation gap was widening and the downside risks to the price path were high as well since international oil prices were expected to remain at a low level for some time following their sharp decline.",
        "He went on to express his view that it was necessary to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period while carefully observing the future trends of all related indicators and information variables, since, although the widening negative inflation and output gaps could be interpreted as offering room for further Base Rate adjustments, the uncertainties accompanying rate adjustments were also not small.",
        "One member meanwhile noted, in support of his agreement that it would be best to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the points that the 3.4% economic growth projection for 2015, although lower than the previous forecast, did not differ greatly from the Korean economy’s potential growth rate, while the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 1% was comparatively favourable, that the downward adjustment of the consumer price inflation outlook had been due mainly to the supply-side factor of declining international oil prices rather than to any contraction in demand, and that further care needed be devoted to ensuring financial stability, since household lending had been showing heightened growth recently and there were several factors causing instability in the international financial markets.",
        "Another member, after also expressing the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He went on to note that if non-customs cleared exports were included in Korean exports then the situation would be more problematic than with exports calculated on a customs clearance basis alone, and that this needed to be borne in mind.",
        "He proceeded to argue that, since negative effects on Korean exports due to the Japanese yen’s weakening seemed to be gradually appearing, efforts should be made to strengthen the monitoring of the movements in the won/yen exchange rate and to reduce its volatility.",
        "He pointed out further, concerning the government moves to improve the household debt structure, that the plan to convert short-term variable-rate loans held by banks to long-term fixed-rate loans, and have the Korea Housing Finance Corporation then acquire and securitize them, could actually increase household debt by enlarging banks’ lending capacities.",
        "He then suggested that the government’s measure to foster a corporate-style housing rental business was deemed a more effective plan for reducing household debt, and that the Bank of Korea should thus also take an interest in it by for instance devising methods to support it.",
        "One other member mentioned that, in view of overall domestic and international financial and economic conditions, prices were likely to maintain a very low rate of increase for a considerable time, influenced by the sharp decline in international oil prices, while the path of growth of the Korean economy appeared to have shifted downward a bit due mainly to the slowdown in the global economy and the prolongation of weak sentiments.",
        "He then disclosed his opinion that, considering that the trend of recovery in the Korean economy was being maintained, even if it had weakened, while the effects of the government’s fiscal expenditure expansion and the recent Base Rate cuts needed to be closely watched for the time being, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members: Monetary Policy Decision - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in the euro area and China, by financial and economic unrest in the oil-producing countries, and by geopolitical risks.",
        "- Looking at the Korean economy, while export growth has slowed somewhat the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic demand has not been strong and the sentiments of economic agents remain weak.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, but that the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time.",
        "- Consumer price inflation fell from 1.0% the month before to 0.8% in December, due mainly to an increase in the scale of decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices registered 1.6%, as in November.",
        "Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise from the second half of this year, after remaining at a low level despite the hike in cigarette prices under the influence for example of international oil price movements.",
        "In the housing market, leasehold deposit and sales prices continued their uptrends—centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas in the former case and around the rest of the country in the latter.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen due for example to stock price declines in other major countries and to the net selling of domestic stocks by foreigners.",
        "After rising, long-term market interest rates have fallen back.",
        "The Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar, due mainly to the widening of the current account surplus and to a slowdown in Japanese yen depreciation, while appreciating against the yen as the synchronization between movements of the won and the yen has weakened.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained its substantial uptrend, led by mortgage loans.",
        "- Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic growth in the US had been higher than expected, and that the moderate recovery in the euro area had continued.",
        "Meanwhile, economic uncertainty in China had remained high with growth continuing to slow.",
        "Members judged that volatility in international financial markets had heightened greatly, owing chiefly to growing concerns about the US Fed’s policy rate hike and to the unrest in the Chinese equity markets.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members noted that, while consumption and services production had shown trends of improvement as the negative effects of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak subsided, the trend of declining exports had accelerated.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members observed that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar due to outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds.",
        "They also noted that long-term interest rates had fallen, affected by stronger preferences for safe assets.",
        "With regard to prices, members observed that, despite declines in petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation had still come in at in the prices of other industrial products.",
        "Inflation expectations declined slightly from the previous month, but remained generally stable.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member assessed that, although consumption and investment in the Korean economy had been showing trends of modest improvement, exports had exhibited a larger-than-expected trend of decline, downside risks to domestic growth and prices had become greater due to the emergence of external uncertainties in line with the global economic slowdown, household debt had maintained strong growth, and volatility and unrest in the foreign exchange market had heightened.",
        "The member then argued that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period, while more closely monitoring major factors affecting the growth and stability of the Korean economy.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that, since the won/dollar exchange rate was expected to fluctuate greatly going forward due to a possible shift in the direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy, the potential expansion of competitive exchange rate policies in major countries, and a trend of large-scale widening of Korea’s current account surplus, the authorities concerned should perform precautionary checks on potential risks, monitor market sentiment, and prepare to implement market stabilization measures without delay.",
        "The member then put forward the view that the policy authorities should analyze the negative effects on corporations of the export decline, which would have significant repercussions on the growth path of the Korean economy, and pursue policy measures to mitigate these effects.",
        "Another member stated the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that, while bearing in mind the heightening of uncertainties in the global economy and finance, there was a need to observe the effects of, for instance, an accommodative policy stance and measures to facilitate consumption.",
        "The member also noted the need to strengthen the monitoring of developments related to financial stability, such as household debt and flows of foreign portfolio investment funds.",
        "The member then went on to present the opinion that, since some have raised a view with respect to the checks on and preparations against external shocks that the crisis in the Chinese economy had broken out in the course of an economic rebalancing from manufacturing to services, there was no need for excessive concerns, but there still was a need to examine the influences of the weakening of China’s role as a consumer in the world economy and as a shock absorber, and that the Bank of Korea should pay attention to the possibility that global interest rates would rise more than originally anticipated in the event of a US Fed rate hike.",
        "The member also requested that the Bank prepare against the possibility that there could be several sources of tension in the domestic financial markets, even though they appeared superficially calm, and that the Bank should deliberate on the operation of policy instruments other than interest rate policy, and consider a mix of monetary policy and macroprudential policy.",
        "The member also stressed that, since the effects of policy responses focusing on demand stimulation had so far been limited, the Bank should take interest in the search for a driver of economic recovery from the perspectives of strengthening supply-side capacities and of enhancing competitiveness.",
        "One other member argued that downside risks to the future growth and price paths were high, taking into account that although economic activity was expected to follow the path forecast in July, downside risks to the growth path for the second half had increased due to a prolonged slump in exports and the manufacturing industry, and considering that although consumer price inflation was judged to be falling somewhat short of the path forecast in July due mainly to the decline in international oil prices, core inflation was holding to the original forecast path, and keeping in mind that the slack in the production sector and the overall spare capacity in the labor market had expanded somewhat.",
        "However, the member stated the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its present level, citing in support that it was uncertain whether the changes in these paths had been significant enough to support further a easing of monetary policy, and that the risks involved in an additional Base Rate adjustment had expanded, owing primarily to the sustained trend of foreign investment fund outflows and to a rapid rise in household debt.",
        "The member then added that a close watch should be kept on the possibility that an expansion of economic unrest in emerging market economies and trade channels, on the possibility of heightened financial market volatility in line with foreign portfolio investment fund outflows, on movements of the real effective exchange rate of the Korean won in line with the changes in Korea’s major trading partners’ exchange rates, as well as the effects of such movements, and on the possibility that the credit cycle would shift rapidly, due to, for instance, its excessive decoupling with the real business cycle.",
        "Meanwhile, one member commented that, while uncertainties about future growth and price movements had expanded, they were judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in July, financial stability risks were considered to have grown, since there was a possibility of increased domestic and overseas financial market volatility triggered by external shocks, and strong growth in household lending was expected to continue.",
        "The member stated the opinion that the Bank of Korea should explain to economic agents that it was important to enhance growth potential by pursuing effective structural reforms, since expansionary macroeconomic policies alone could provide only limited support to economic recovery because the recent lower-than-expected economic growth was attributable more to structural factors in the Korean economy and to shrinking global demand than to cyclical factors.",
        "The member also noted that, to prevent excessive anxiety stemming from the recent heightened volatility in global financial markets, the Bank should assure economic agents that Korea’s capacity to respond to external shocks was relatively sound, thanks to its large current account surplus, abundant holdings of official foreign reserves, and banks’ safe external debt structures.",
        "Another member noted that some had leveled the criticism that monetary policy had not been sufficiently accommodative, as consumer price inflation had continued to decline since 2012, running below the inflation target.",
        "The member stated that this criticism seemed to overlook the fact that prices had been unrelated to economic activity, with the economic growth rate increasing despite a decline in prices.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in line with the current economic environment, with its weakened link between prices and economic activity, the Bank of Korea needed to think carefully about ways to improve inflation targeting and other aspects of the existing monetary policy operation framework.",
        "The member also presented the view that insufficient economic growth despite accommodative monetary policy was a counterexample suggesting that in addition to cyclical factors, structural factors, including a decline in potential growth, had played a significant role in determining the economic growth rate, and thus there was a need to perform separate analyses of the extents to which these kinds of factors are responsible for low economic growth, and to deeply reflect on appropriate monetary policy directions and structural reforms that could raise the potential growth rate.",
        "One other member assessed that, if the changes in domestic and international financial and economic conditions during the previous month were considered, the future growth and price paths of the Korean economy appeared to have shifted slightly downward in comparison with the July forecast, influenced for instance by the sustained sluggishness of exports and by the decline in international oil prices.",
        "However, the member argued that, since this downward shift in the growth and price paths was mainly attributable to changes in external conditions, including economic uncertainties surrounding China and the sluggishness of world trade, there was a need to further observe their developments going forward, and thus the Board should hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, despite heightened international financial market volatility, financial instability seemed unlikely to spread to Korea, thanks largely to Korea’s sustained current account surplus and to sound financial conditions at Korean financial institutions.",
        "However, the member then went on to express the view that the Bank of Korea should keep a close eye on the possible spread of external uncertainties in order to prepare for all eventualities, and that the Bank should do all it can to manage external sector risk by refining and updating its contingency plans.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well.",
        "Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility, due to the instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets and to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.",
        "demand activities such as consumption and investment has continued, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the improvement in economic agents’ sentiments has been inadequate.",
        "On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of persons employed slowed in August, owing mainly to a base effect, the employment-to-population ratio decreased while the unemployment rate rose compared to those in August of last year.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to have increased.",
        "inflation registered 0.7% in August, the same as in July, in line mainly with expansions in the extents of increase in prices of other industrial products.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 2.1%, from 2.0% in July.",
        "Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen, as portfolio investment funds of foreigners have flowed out due to factors such as the instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets.",

        "In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the financial instabilities in emerging market countries including China, as well as the trends of capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the pace of the economic recovery in the US had weakened, influenced for instance by severe cold spells, that the euro area had sustained its modest recovery, and that economic growth in emerging markets including China had continued to slow.",
        "Members’ appraisal of the international financial markets was that, with the price corrections taking place since late April, centering around stock and bond markets in advanced countries including Germany and the US, global treasury bond yields had rebounded sharply and the extents of increase in stock prices had narrowed.",
        "As to the domestic economy, although noting that domestic demand and production indicators had exhibited sluggishness in March and then rebounded in April, members assessed exports to have continued on their trend of decline.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members commented that long-term market interest rates had risen significantly, influenced for example by the jumps in treasury bond yields in major countries, and that stock prices had fallen back after having risen.",
        "Many members moreover judged that household loans had expanded considerably, affected chiefly by the revitalization of housing transactions and by record low home mortgage interest rates.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had remained unchanged from the previous month’s 0.4%, and that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had fallen to slightly below the preceding month’s level at 2.0%.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlooks for them both, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One of these members argued that, although there were downside risks to the domestic economy due to the decline in exports, maintaining the Base Rate at its present level for the current month would be desirable given the fact that the domestic economy was expected to move along the growth path forecast the previous month.",
        "After pointing out that exports had continued to decline for the fourth month in a row, and that exports to Japan and the euro area in particular had fallen to considerable extents, due largely to the depreciations of the Japanese yen and the euro, he went on to point out that, although Korea continued to run a substantial bilateral current account deficit against Japan, the imbalance in the won/yen exchange rate had been worsening recently due to the yen’s weakness while the won had been feeling appreciation pressures owing to Korea‘s widening bilateral current account surplus vis-a-vis the US.",
        "The member then stated his view that this was attributable to the structural difficulty of resolving regional currency imbalances since Korea’s only direct foreign exchange market was the won/dollar market.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period because, if the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic situation over the previous month were looked at comprehensively, economic activity and consumer prices were judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in April, and considering the uncertainties surrounding domestic and foreign economic movements and the possibility of heightened international financial market volatility, there was a need to secure room for future monetary policy maneuver.",
        "One other member stated an opinion that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He noted that, on the external front, there were divergences in the directions of economic movements as the economic recoveries in the US and the euro area had been positive while the Japanese and Chinese economies were slowing.",
        "And on the domestic front, although there were some expectations of improvement such as in sentiment indicators, the negative output gap appeared likely to persist for a considerable time since no trend of overall improvement had yet gained traction.",
        "He went on to express the view that, in the current situation in which it was unclear whether domestic demand had recovered, maintenance of the growth path expected for this year would depend upon exports.",
        "He suggested further that, while closely monitoring large-scale flows of funds among financial instruments and among financial institutions, in pursuit of returns in this continuing low interest rate environment, together with the attendant risks, the Committee should examine the conditions for policy implementation such as measuring the threshold level of household debt beyond which an upturn in the real business cycle would be constrained and the minimum acceptable rate of real GDP growth.",
        "It should also, he said, come up with measures in preparation against the risks of insolvency and of widespread defaults on the household debts of low-income and low-credit borrowers.",
        "One member on the other hand asserted that the effects of the three Base Rate cuts and the improvements in the terms of trade stemming from the declines in oil prices had not yet been fully reflected in the Korean economy, citing in support the following points: first, that although there had been signs since the beginning of the second quarter of an economic recovery, albeit a modest one, the trend of recovery had been limited to that through the first-round transmission channel of monetary policy accommodation, and there was thus a need to observe a little longer to determine whether it would spread to become a well-balanced recovery, embracing the real economy as a whole through improvements of household incomes and corporate performances; second, that although the recent trend of declines in prices had weakened somewhat, demand-side inflationary pressures were still not sufficient to lead to any appreciable narrowing of the negative inflationary gap, and the risk also remained high of the instability in inflation expectations expanding due to prolongation of the supply-side price decline shock; and third, that the trend of labor market improvement was showing sluggishness, with the rate of labor force participation and the employment rate both declining and high levels of spare capacity still in both the labor market and production.",
        "Having said all this, he took the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since it was difficult to tell whether the economic movements in the second quarter had been deviating to any significant extents from the path forecast in April.",
        "Another member noted that, although there were great uncertainties as to growth and prices owing to the existence of both upside and downside risks, they were deemed to be generally following the path forecast in April, while on the financial front the need had grown for paying attention to the possibility of increasing risk since lending to households was expanding sharply and international financial market volatility was intensifying.",
        "Considering these factors, he expressed the opinion that it would be best to maintain the Base Rate at its present level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member stated the opinion that a downward adjustment of the Base Rate by 25bp to 1.50% would be desirable – given the emergence of significant downside risks to the future growth path owing mainly to the accelerated paces of declines in exports and imports and to the presence of additional downside price risks as well, the need for an appropriate response by the monetary authorities in relation to the recent spread of monetary easing and currency devaluation policies undertaken in many countries, and the consequent depreciation pressures on the Korean won, and the likelihood of the scope for monetary policy adjustment narrowing steadily on growing expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate hike in the latter half of this year.",
        "He went on to state that, although the problem of the sharp increase in household debt was at present the biggest policy cost due to monetary policy easing, it was unlikely to be a severe macroeconomic risk factor in the short-term given that the household debt-to-income ratio in Korea was relatively low, and that in correspondence to the build up of household debt household assets were also increasing.",
        "He added that the rapid pace of increase in household debt needed to be managed appropriately through microprudential rather than macroprudential policy.",
        "Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members compiled a detailed statement that reflected the majority opinion.",
        "Mr. Ha, Seong Geun however dissented, expressing clear opposition to holding the Base Rate at its current level and arguing for a 0.25 percentage point cut.",
        "today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that, while the trend of economic recovery in the US has shown signs of temporarily slowing, improvements in the euro area have continued.",
        "In emerging market countries including China the trends of slowing growth have continued.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by uncertainties over the restructuring of Greek debt.",
        "their trend of decline and domestic demand-related indicators have fluctuated from month to month, the sentiments of economic agents have improved.",
        "On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio has fallen as the number of persons employed in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector has decreased, but the unemployment rate has maintained the same level as that during April of last year.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time.",
        "□ Despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural and petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation registered 0.4% in April, the same as in March, as the rate of increase in prices of industrial products slowed.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 2.0%, from 2.1% in March.",

        "Stock prices have also risen, chiefly on net purchases of domestic stocks by foreigners.",
        "The Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, due mainly to the possibility of a delay in the policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and to inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds, but has since depreciated.",

        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy appeared to be emerging from its sluggishness in the first quarter, and the mildly improving trends in the euro area and Japan had continued, while economic growth in China had continued to slow.",
        "Members judged that, amid the high price volatility of the international financial markets, interest rates had risen and stock prices had fallen.",
        "As to the domestic economy, most members noted that, with exports exhibiting sluggishness, consumption and business confidence had both contracted, influenced by the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members commented that long-term market interest rates had fallen back after having risen, and that stock prices had fallen, influenced for instance by declining global stock prices.",
        "A number of members also noted that banks’ household lending had sustained its high rate of increase at a level exceeding that of recent years.",
        "With regard to prices, many members noted that consumer price inflation had risen slightly from the previous month to stand at 0.5%, and that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had also risen slightly to 2.5%, but both indexes still remained at a low level.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environment and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to cut the Base Rate by period.",
        "One of these members rationalized his opinion as to the desirability of cutting the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point.",
        "He argued that, although there was concern that an additional Base Rate cut by the Bank of Korea would merely bring about an erosion of its policy-making capacity, since the Korean economy was currently in a condition in which it would be very difficult to regain its dynamism simply through additional interest rate reductions or fiscal expansion.",
        "Furthermore, in the current sufficiently accommodative financial conditions, the Bank’s further lowering of interest rates could give rise to several negative side effects.",
        "Having said this, he nevertheless stated his belief that it was absolutely vital to cope preemptively with the malevolent side-effects of the worries about the recent weakening of the pace of economic recovery coming as it did on top of the negative impact on economic agents’ sentiment of the MERS outbreak, which judging from past experience, was likely to be substantial.",
        "He concluded his remarks by calling for a vigilance against an increase in household debt that might be triggered by the protracted period of low interest rates and against the heightening of financial market volatility.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be best to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point in view of the following points: firstly, that, although price movements were following the path forecast in April, there was an increased possibility of economic growth not reaching the forecasted path; secondly, that, although there were uncertainties concerning the duration and knock-on effects of the MERS outbreak, it was necessary to undertake a preemptive policy response to reduce its negative impact on economic agents’ sentiment and economic activities.",
        "He went on to state his view that it was necessary to consider ways to relieve the difficulties of companies hit by the MERS outbreak by making use of the Bank of Korea’s Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, and that greater attention should be paid both to a rapid build-up of household debt in line with the lower Base Rate, and to the widened scale of price variables’ volatility such as that of interest and exchange rates unleased by the possible normalization of the US Fed’s monetary policy.",
        "Another member stated his opinion that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, as additional factors conducive to a Base Rate cut were seen to have come into play since last month’s monetary policy decision and a preemptive response was called for to the excessive contraction of economic confidence following the cluster of MERS outbreaks.",
        "He went on to further justify this position by noting that the negative output gap would now be resolved at an even later date considering the declining likelihood of the originally-forecast second-quarter economic turnaround as exports were likely to remain sluggish for the time being, affected chiefly by the decrease in EME trade and REER appreciation in line with the Chinese economic slowdown, added to which there was the possibility of a further reduction of private consumption owing to MERS cases; moreover, the downside risks to the growth path for the second half were rising significantly.",
        "Moreover, core inflation was also highly unlikely to reach the appropriate level of inflation in the first half of the following year owing to the insufficiency of demand-side upward pressures, which more than offset the expected gradual increase in inflation in the second half.",
        "In addition, the extent of the slack in the production sector had expanded in terms of facilities investment demand pressures, the inventory-shipments ratio and average capacity utilization ratio, while that in the employment sector also had not exhibited a significant decrease in terms of the unemployment rate and the unemployment rate broadly defined.",
        "Meanwhile, another member mentioned that downside risks to economic growth had expanded, with the heightened possibility of domestic demand being hard hit by the outbreak of MERS with the acceleration of the decline in exports showing signs of spreading to production and other areas; moreover the shrinking of demand following the cluster of MERS cases might put further downside risks to prices, while there were growing upward pressures on the Korean won in the domestic exchange market, in line with a number of countries’ accommodative monetary policies.",
        "The member then expressed his opinion that additional monetary easing should be implemented promptly at this point of time so as to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, as expectations of a US Fed’s policy rate hike would grow and interest and exchange rate volatility would both increase towards the second half of this year, which was highly likely to limit the monetary authorities’ maneuvering room for policy.",
        "The member went on to state that household debt risk, a policy cost incident to monetary easing, was a problem that should be addressed by securing debt repayment capacity through improved nominal incomes, adding the caveat that since sudden surges in household debt were never desirable, the policy authorities should energetically seek to manage risk by way of microprudential policy.",
        "Another member commented that overseas economies were moving in different directions － a positive recovery trend in US and the euro area but a slowdown in China and other emerging market economies.",
        "On the home front while there were signs of improvement in domestic demand in some sectors led by consumption, there were downside risks to exports and manufacturing production and concerns had been aroused by the withering of economic sentiment in line with the emergence of external and domestic uncertainties.",
        "He went on to argue that, as it seemed difficult to hold to this April’s forecast growth path due mainly to the instability of employment and domestic consumption in a situation where there was a substantial degree of slack production capacity in the economy, the Base Rate should be cut by 0.25 of a percentage point this month so as to respond preemptively to these downside risks to the growth path.",
        "The member added that in the course of policy implementation it was necessary to closely monitor and manage issues of concern including the household debt problem and other risks to financial stability, and the delayed structural adjustment.",
        "At the same time a cautious watch must be kept on the future impact of changes in global financial and economic conditions, the effects of the waning of economic sentiment on domestic demand, and those of export sluggishness on production and investment.",
        "He further advocated the creation of monetary policy conditions favorable to restructuring in order to enhance private-sector productivity and boost the potential growth rate, while at the same time making appropriate and flexible use of the policy toolkit to ward off external financial stress, maintain economic momentum and promote financial stability.",
        "On the other hand, one other member put forward his view that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "Noting that there was not much difference between the economic trend at this point of time and the conditions and outlooks this April and May, he argued that the sharp increase in the rate of growth in real national income in the first quarter suggested that the low inflation caused by the decline in international oil prices could be seen as good disinflation bringing about income growth and that the increased consumption capacity following this growth in real national income could act as a positive factor contributing to future improvement in domestic economic activity.",
        "The member added that the MERS clusters were basically no more than an incidental and temporary shock that might affect the growth rate but neither the trend of economic activity nor the growth path; it would be a hasty move to respond by way of interest rates.",
        "He went on to state that, in the current low interest rate environment, a further Base Rate cut would have far less impact on growth than hitherto and its drawbacks would be therefore greater than its benefits given its side effects such as increasing household debt and a consequent buildup of financial instability.",
        "Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members compiled a statement that specifically reflected the majority opinion.",

        "One of these members noted that, with the exception of the household lending trend, all economic developments at home and abroad since the month previous indicated heightened necessity of an additional Base Rate cut.",
        "He went on to argue that, in contrast to previous periods of real estate bubble formation, the recent expansion in household debt was attributable mainly to an increased volume of transactions and to a rise in leasehold deposit prices.",
        "And considering moreover that it would be appropriate to cope initially with the risks posed by excessive household debt through macroprudential policy measures, it was undesirable at this time for the monetary authorities to hesitate in taking timely measures in response to changes in global economic conditions and to new downside risks to prices and growth.",
        "It would therefore be appropriate to cut the Base Rate this month, from its current 2.0% to 1.75%.",
        "Another member noted, in view of overall financial and economic conditions domestically and overseas, the possibility that the negative output gap might continue for a longer period of time than had been expected.",
        "He pointed out that, on the external side, the trends of improvement in economic activities in major countries apart from the U.S. were unclear, the uncertainties about the future direction of the global economy had not disappeared, due chiefly to the expectations of a U.S. policy rate hike, to the continuation of monetary policy accommodativeness in major countries, and to the reemergence of the Greek issue.",
        "On the domestic front, although economic agent sentiments had shown some signs of improvement the domestic demand recovery remained weak and exports were sluggish.",
        "The member went on to advocate the necessity of adjusting the Base Rate downward to 1.75%, to dispel the vulnerabilities in the growth path and prevent materialization of the downside risks to the economy.",
        "One other member noted that, in view of the weaker than expected January and February indicators, it was difficult to say that the growth shock in the fourth quarter of 2014 had been due only to one-off factors including a shortfall in tax revenues.",
        "He added that downward adjustment of the forecast price path was unavoidable with the negative output gap widening due to the rapid decline in consumer price inflation, and that, despite the two Base Rate cuts last year, real interest rates were rising again due to declines in consumer price inflation and in inflation expectations, while the real neutral rate was on the other hand showing a gradual trend of decrease due mainly to demographic structural changes.",
        "The real effective Korean won exchange rate was meanwhile on the rise, in line with the spread of accommodative monetary policy stances globally.",
        "In consideration of all of these points, the member then stated his opinion that it would be necessary to lower the Base Rate to 1.75% this month, to support the economy’s return to its potential growth path by narrowing the negative output and negative price gaps, and to respond preemptively to the possibilities of a future drop in expected inflation and of a spread of deflationary sentiments.",
        "Another member meanwhile presented the views that, with the GDP gap negative there was a possibility of future real economic growth not reaching the potential growth rate, and that the low inflation was expected to persist for a considerable time as well.",
        "It was thus necessary to continuously support the recovery of Korean economic growth and expansion of the growth potential, by lowering the Base Rate by 25bp this month while raising the ceiling on the Financial Intermediation Support Facility and adjusting the scope of its coverage.",
        "He added that, while still greater attention should be paid to household debt, which was a potential risk to financial stability, improvements in the household debt structure should be pursued effectively through cooperation among the institutions concerned, and macroprudential measures should if necessary also be devised to curb the increase in the total lending amount.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period would be desirable, commenting that, rather than bringing about the promotion of corporate investment or an increase in household consumption, a further Base Rate cut could result instead in actually hindering firms’ structural reforms and causing long-term financial instability to intensify by increasing household debt.",
        "This member continued by noting that if the Bank Intermediation Support Facility, a non interest-rate policy tool, were utilized, it could minimize the growth of household debt and have an economic stimulus effect by channeling credit into corporate lending only, with household lending excluded.",
        "To this end, he remarked, the Bank Intermediation Support Facility should be redesigned to allow counter-cyclical operation and, if necessary, the scope of coverage of its support should be expanded from small and medium-size enterprises at present to also include leading medium-size firms.",
        "The member went on to point out that Korea’s fiscal spending since the global financial crisis had been inadequate to support economic recovery, and its management had also not been sufficiently counter-cyclical, adding that exerting a direct influence on private investment and consumption through government fiscal policy could be an effective plan.",
        "Another member expressed his own opinion of the desirability of maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He reasoned, firstly, that although the pace of the domestic economic recovery was somewhat weak compared with that forecast in January, under the recent domestic and international conditions it was necessary to pay greater attention to the employment situation than to economic growth, and it was not desirable to resort to use of the Base Rate only out of concerns about a drop in the growth rate.",
        "Secondly, considering the maneuvering room for monetary policy, it was necessary to exercise greater caution in deciding on a Base Rate level that had never been experienced before, and under the current overall accommodative financial conditions a Base Rate cut would have only limited effect.",
        "Thirdly, he said, when the price-related data were looked at comprehensively the fears about deflation that had emerged as an issue recently seemed somewhat excessive, while account should also be taken of the concerns about the increase in household debt.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the members compiled a statement that reflected the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Chung, Hae-Bang and Mr.",
        "Moon, Woosik expressed clear opposition to the idea of lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for holding it unchanged at its current level.",
        "today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.00% to that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has been sustained and improvements, albeit modest, have also continued in the euro area, economic growth in emerging market countries including China has slowed.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks.",
        "have decreased, due mostly to declines in the unit prices for example of petroleum products, that domestic demand activities such as private consumption and facilities investment have exhibited sluggish movements, and that the sentiments of economic agents have also not clearly recovered.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although falling short of the originally forecast growth path.",
        "The period of continuation of the negative output gap will as a result also be longer than had been anticipated.",
        "in February, owing mainly to increases in the extents of decline in petroleum product prices and to the slower paces of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to forecasts that, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices, inflation will continue at a level lower than originally expected.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices accelerated slightly, while leasehold deposit prices continued their uptrend centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "net buying of domestic stocks for example, stock prices have recently fallen under the influence mostly of declines in stock prices in major countries.",
        "The Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar, affected by the dollar’s strength globally and by the synchronization between movements of the won and the Japanese yen following the yen’s weakening, while it has fluctuated within a certain range against the yen.",
        "Long-term market interest rates had risen, but have since declined.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process, it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy continued to grow, driven by domestic demand, but that despite the continuation of its mildly improving trend, the downside risks to the euro area had increased due to the Greek crisis, while economic growth in China had continued to slow.",
        "Members judged that volatility had intensified in international financial markets, owing chiefly to the difficulties in the Greek debt negotiations and the fall in Chinese stock prices.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members noted that, with exports continuing to decline, consumption had contracted significantly, affected by outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members commented that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, influenced by the international financial market unrest.",
        "A number of members also noted that banks’ household lending had sustained its high rate of increase, led by mortgage loans.",
        "With regard to prices, many members observed that consumer price inflation had risen slightly from the previous month but still remained at the low level of 0.7%, and that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had come in at 2.0%, a level similar to that of the preceding month.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environment and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One of these members assessed that, with downside risks to the global economy increasing, the domestic economy now faced heightened risks of slow growth and slow price rises owing to the contraction of domestic demand and exports.",
        "He then argued that, while keeping the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50%, it would be necessary to keep a careful watch on the effects of the previous Base Rate cuts and the government’s pump priming measures and to monitor closely the future developments of major risk factors at home and abroad.",
        "He went on to state that it would be advisable to examine whether or not the previous Base Rate cuts were having their desired policy effects and to study and put in place proposals to increase the effects of monetary policy.",
        "The member also stressed there should be a recognition of the urgent need to develop multi-faceted and dynamic initiatives at both a corporate and government level to cope with the decline in exports that had recently prompted growing concern.",
        "Another member pointed out that the uncertainties on the external front had increased with the recovery in the euro area being blown off course following the Greek crisis and with the persistent sluggishness in China and other emerging market countries even as the timing of a US interest rate hike approached.",
        "On the domestic side, he added that downside risks to the economy remained unresolved due to the sustained sluggishness of consumption, exports, industrial production and the agricultural sector.",
        "He also expressed the view that, as economic agents might face shocks from the adjustment of expectations in line with the downward adjustment of the economic outlook, it would be necessary to work actively to boost the potential growth rate in consideration of changes in the productivity structure over the medium and long term, while maximizing the effects of the monetary and fiscal policy.",
        "Meanwhile, he argued the need for finding ways to strengthen international cooperation in response to the changing conditions including a tendency toward excess financial elasticity in the international monetary system, the Greek stand-off and rising international interest rates in order to stabilize financial markets in readiness against the household debt problem and the weakening of financial institutions’ soundness, and to promote preemptive and market-friendly corporate restructuring through the capital market.",
        "With regard to the operation of inflation targeting, he added that in his view it was desirable to consider setting sub-targets, such as asset prices, that could reflect changes in economic agents’ interests, the stability of the value of money, and the introduction of dual monetary targets.",
        "One other member noted that the economy had been showing a markedly slower pace of recovery due to continued sluggishness of exports, and to a renewed contraction, since the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), of private consumption and other components of domestic demand, which had been showing a recovery.",
        "He added that, although concerns over the possibility of deflation had gradually been easing as inflation-related indicators had risen for the third consecutive month, there was a possibility that core inflation would once again not reach its appropriate level in the second half of 2016 owing to the shortfall of demand-side upward pressures.",
        "In addition, the extent of slack in the production sector had widened and, similarly, there had continued to be a considerable degree of slack in the employment sector.",
        "Taking all these points into consideration, the member voiced his opinion as to the desirability of maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy’s return to its potential growth track.",
        "Having said this, he nevertheless stated his belief that the Board should hold the Base Rate at its current level this month, checking cautiously as to whether the trend of growth would recover following the forecast path, since the Board had responded preemptively to anticipations of a growth rate shock in the second quarter by cutting the Base Rate in June.",
        "Meanwhile, he added that, since marginal benefits of a Base Rate adjustment were decreasing and the marginal costs increasing with the Base Rate at an historic low, it was essential to suggest effective macroprudential policy instruments and policy operation alternatives, to secure useful policy tools in preparation against the possibility of monetary policy having only limited effects due to a rise in long-term interest rates, and to further systemize the strategic framework for the flexible operation of inflation targeting to consolidate the stability of inflation expectations.",
        "One member expressed his personal opinion as to the desirability of maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and closely checking for changes in the upside and downside risks to the growth and price paths on the basis, for example, of the information additionally obtained from economic indicators.",
        "He reasoned, firstly, that although the GDP growth forecasts for 2015 had been revised downward, this was attributable to an extremely lackluster second-quarter performance due mainly to one-off factors and that the Board had expected it and responded preemptively by cutting the Base Rate in June.",
        "Secondly, although there was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the growth path going forward, expansionary macroeconomic policies exemplified by the four-step Base Rate cut and the government’s fiscal stimulus package including the supplementary budget were capable of supporting the recovery of economic growth.",
        "Thirdly, greater attention should, he argued, be devoted to financial stability since household debt was maintaining a persistently high rate of increase in the environment of historically low Base Rates, and financial market uncertainty had been heightened largely because of the Greek situation and the large scale of the correction in Chinese stock prices.",
        "Another member stated his view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He pointed out that household lending had increased much more rapidly than in the past, due mainly to the changes in the housing rental market structure brought about by low interest rates, and that housing prices were rising sharply in certain regions, notably Daegu and Gyeongbuk.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that in regions where the housing market was showing signs of overheating, it was necessary to either strengthen the LTV and DTI regulations or apply them in a flexible manner.",
        "He went on to note that the current account surplus was expected to widen greatly this year, due to a sharp decline in imports stemming from the sustained low oil price, and this trend was likely to continue on into next year, thus gradually heightening appreciation pressures on the won.",
        "Arguing that, insofar as the government’s recent measures to revitalize overseas investment sought to address the won appreciation in the financial sector, their effects could be limited, would thus need to be supplemented by introducing indicative import management in the real sector such as the adjustment of the import timing or the shift of import channels from those trading partners running current account surpluses with Korea to those whose bilateral current account deficits had increased sharply.",
        "Meanwhile, one other member noted that, although a look at changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad over the past one month showed that there had been no large changes in the price path, the growth path was judged to have been adjusted slightly downward, affected for instance by the MERS outbreak and sluggish exports.",
        "Nevertheless, reflecting this state of affairs, the Base Rate had been lowered the previous month to 1.50%, a historic low, and the government also was pursuing fiscal expansion including the compilation of a supplementary budget.",
        "In view of the need to observe somewhat longer the effects of these steps, it would, he advocated, be best to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has grown evident again, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well.",
        "In emerging market countries including China the trends of slowing growth have continued.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the heightened international financial market volatility due to the situation in Greece, by changes in the monetary policies of major countries and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.",
        "- Looking at the Korean economy, amid continued sluggishness in exports the Board notes that, under the influence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak for example, consumption has declined significantly and the sentiments of economic agents have worsened.",
        "On the employment front, the unemployment rate has risen due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, but the employment-to-population ratio has also increased as the number of persons employed has grown.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, owing chiefly to the expansionary macroeconomic policies and to the subsiding of the shock from the MERS outbreak, but judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",
        "- Consumer price inflation rose from 0.5% the month before to 0.7% in June, due mainly to increases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 2.0%, from 2.1% in May.",
        "Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by the situation in Greece, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have risen, in response mainly to expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and of an increased volume of Korean Treasury bond issuance.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "- Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as the situation in Greece and shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as the trends of capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the pace of recovery in the US had slowed somewhat, influenced for instance by an unusually severe cold spell and by the US dollar’s strength, and that the euro area had sustained its modest recovery, while economic growth in China had continued to slow due mainly to the slump in its real estate market and to adjustments of its excess capacity.",
        "Members judged the international financial markets to be stable overall, owing chiefly to the maintenance of accommodative policy stances by central banks in major countries.",
        "As to the domestic economy, many members noted that exports had continued their trend of decline and judged that, although domestic-demand related indicators had improved compared to the previous month, the trend of economic recovery was weak.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets meanwhile, members observed that long-term market interest rates had fallen, stock prices had risen, and the won, after having depreciated against the US dollar, had again appreciated.",
        "A number of members noted that housing transactions had become more active and the trends of increase in housing sales and leasehold deposit prices had accelerated, owing mainly to shifts from deposit-based tenancies to outright sales or monthly payment-based rentals, while bank household lending had sustained its trend of increase centering on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation was agricultural, livestock and marine product prices.",
        "They commented that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products was also below than in the preceding month, at 2.1%.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environment and the future outlooks for both, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One of these members argued that, while consumer prices were likely to sustain a low rate of increase of below 1% for the time being, owing mainly to the continued downward pressures on the demand side and to the effects of the low oil prices, the economic recovery’s momentum was still being maintained despite a downward shift in the Korean economy’s growth path.",
        "This member went on to express the opinion that, since the Base Rate had been reduced the previous month in consideration of these downward shifts in the growth and price paths, there was a need to observe the effects of this cut and it would thus be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its present level for the current month.",
        "Another member then also put forward a view that maintaining the Base Rate at its present level for this month would be appropriate.",
        "Concerning the recent downward revisions of the forecasts for economic growth and consumer price inflation, compared to those in January, this member noted that it was natural to revise economic outlooks, which are based upon assumptions about future economic conditions at home and abroad at the time of they are made, in line with changes that could not have been foreseen at that time.",
        "He went on to express his opinion that, rather than expecting the Bank of Korea’s economic forecasts to be realized exactly, economic agents should consider them as references for future economic forecasts, and should bear in mind the fact that, when the assumptions underlying them are changing, forecasts can also be revised.",
        "One other member then stated his opinion that, despite the downward revision of the central bank’s forecasts for growth and consumer price inflation, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He cited as reasons the facts that these revisions had been anticipated and preemptively responded to by cutting the Base Rate by 25 basis points and raising the ceiling of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility substantially the previous month, that, since Korean GDP growth was forecast to be at around its potential level from the second quarter of this year, it would be desirable from the standpoints of securing policy-making capacity, the intensity of the policy response and monetary policy credibility to wait and observe the effects of the monetary easing measures implemented to this time, rather than lowering the Base Rate further, and that since household debt was sustaining a high rate of increase there was a need to devote greater attention to financial stability.",
        "Another member meanwhile pointed out several aspects of growth and price conditions that could be seen as indicating a need for Base Rate adjustment.",
        "First, the Korean economy’s negative output gap had widened due to the growth rate shock in the fourth quarter of last year, and growth during the first quarter of this year had been somewhat insufficient to narrow the output gap to any noticeable extent.",
        "Second, it was difficult to identify any signs in demand-side price indicators of the inflation gap narrowing significantly.",
        "Third, the instability of inflation expectations had risen: the March price outlook CSI and expected inflation among members of the general public had declined slightly, while the share of respondents in the survey choosing expected inflation below 2 percent had increased.",
        "Fourth, there was still substantial spare capacity in both production and employment, with the manufacturing operation ratio remaining at a low level and broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate increasing.",
        "Despite all of this, however, he argued that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since these factors had already been taken into account to a substantial extent in the Base Rate cut the month previous, and there was a need to observe the effects of the three recent cuts in the Base Rate and the positive knock-on effects of the declines in oil prices a little longer.",
        "Another member noted that, on the overseas front, there were both positive factors, with the US economic recovery continuing and improvements in the euro area, and negative ones, such as the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries including China.",
        "On the domestic front, meanwhile, the pace of improvement in economic activities was not rapid enough to indicate entry into a phase of sustained growth.",
        "He went on to state that, amid the uncertainties over external conditions, the spillovers to other economic sectors such as consumption from firms’ planned implementations of facilities investments and revitalization of the real estate market would be important driving forces for future economic recovery.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that the Base Rate should be held at its current level for the intermeeting period, and efforts should be made to return the Korean economy onto a stable path of growth as early as possible, by considering in a balanced manner the macro-economic risks to growth and prices together with risks to financial stability, while at the same time taking note of any changes in global financial and economic conditions.",
        "Another member stated his opinion that a small downward adjustment of the Base Rate from its current level of 1.75% would be advisable since, with the exception of the trend of changes in household lending other recent policy conditions were all indicating a need for further monetary policy easing.",
        "As some examples he pointed out that domestic demand had not improved sufficiently this year and was unlikely to show a solid improvement in the near future, that downside risks to exports had been emerging in the medium- and long-term, in view of the trend of won appreciation against the currencies of Korea‘s export rivals and the delays in economic recoveries of its major export partners, and that the downside risks to prices had recently grown even further.",
        "The member added that it should be borne in mind that, although an additional Base Rate cut might entail potential risks, the possibilities of abrupt surges in inflation and capital outflows were not great at present, while the more important reason for the recent sharp increase in household lending, rather than the cuts in the Base Rate, had been the going ahead by households with housing purchases that they had deferred until now, as well as the shifts from leasehold-deposit tenancies to outright housing purchases.",
        "Taking into consideration the results of the discussions earlier, members compiled a statement that specifically reflected the majority opinion.",
        "Mr. Ha, Seong Geun however dissented, expressing clear opposition to holding the Base Rate at its current level and arguing for a small downward adjustment.",
        "today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and improvements have also continued in the euro area, economic growth in emerging market countries including China has slowed.",
        "The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks.",
        "domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment appear to have improved, although exports have continued their trend of decline due mostly to decreases in the unit prices for example of petroleum products, while the sentiments of economic agents have not clearly recovered.",
        "On the employment front, the unemployment rate has risen somewhat, due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, but the employment-to-population ratio has also increased as the number of persons employed has steadily grown.",
        "The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time.",
        "□ Despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation fell from 0.5% the month before to livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 2.1%, from 2.3% in February, owing to a slowdown in the rate of industrial product price increase.",
        "Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have accelerated in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "have fallen while stock prices have risen, due largely to the Base Rate cut, to the easing of concerns about an early policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, and to inflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds.",
        "The Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar but has since appreciated, affected by changes in expectations related to the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve.",
        "After depreciating, the won has also appreciated against the Japanese yen.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that Chinese economic growth was continuing to slow down, with the nation’s exports declining, while the US economy was maintaining its recovery, with consumption, facilities investment and the housing market continuing to improve and employment growth accelerating, and the euro area was showing a modest recovery.",
        "Members also judged that international financial markets had responded sensitively for example to the diverging policy stances of major countries.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members assessed that exports had continued to decline, while the economy showed modest recovery, led by domestic demand including consumption and investment.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, most members noted that long-term interest rates had risen substantially, owing mainly to improvements in domestic economic indicators and the greater likelihood of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, and that there was a shift to a net inflow of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds.",
        "They also mentioned that bank lending to the household sector had increased significantly, led by mortgage lending, with October recording the strongest growth since the statistics had been first compiled.",
        "With regard to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had stood at 0.9 percent, up from the previous month, due mainly to greater increases in agricultural product prices and services fees, and that core inflation had also increased slightly from the preceding month.",

        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member assessed that, amid the accelerating growth in household loans driven chiefly by increased group loans in line with buoyant sales of new apartments, group loans were expected to work to increase household loans for the time being, which might limit the effects of the comprehensive household debt management measure that aims to slow down growth in household debt from next year, and that it would be therefore necessary to develop ways to prepare against the possibility of household debt emerging as a huge burden on the Korean economy.",
        "The member also mentioned that, because the traditional channels of interest rate policy transmission to the real and financial sectors were likely to weaken greatly due to the possibility of the trends of slow growth and slow price increases continuing for a considerable period of time, and also because interest rate policy alone could not cope effectively with conflicts among various policy objectives, efforts were urgently needed to develop various monetary policy instruments other than policy rate adjustment and use them in combination.",
        "In line with this, the member expressed the opinion that the framework of existing policy instruments, such as open market operations and the bank intermediary support facility, needed urgent improvement to adjust to the changing environment.",
        "Another member stated the view that a little more time would be needed before making an optimistic forecast for future economic activity, as the G2 risks remained on the external side ─ expectations of a US Fed policy rate hike within the year and concerns about China and EMEs ─ and as the domestic side has seen a revival of expectations regarding improvements in economic activity but also continuing downside risks, including sluggish exports.",
        "The member noted that it would be important to promote positive views of business conditions and encourage economic agents to carry out economic activities, so that briskness in some parts of domestic demand could lead to growth in terms of overall production capacity.",
        "The member also called for diagnoses of and prescriptions for sluggish exports from various perspectives, analyses of the effects of China’s five-year plan, and research into current demographic issues in an effort to prepare against highly probable shocks related to growth.",
        "The member went on to argue that preparations should be made against the possibility of interest rates showing greater volatility than foreign exchange rates, since there were only slight differences among the fundamentals of advanced economies.",
        "The member also presented the view that the existing tools for managing exchange rate volatility should be reexamined in preparation for Korea’s joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that overseas markets for direct won trading needed to be gradually adjusted in ways that encourage private sector participation.",
        "The member also noted that it should be examined whether shrinking capital markets and the growing dependence on banks undermined balanced development of the financial industry, and that preparations should be made to deal flexibly with herd behavior in the bond market.",
        "The member stressed that economic agents had not recovered from damage from the Asian Currency and Global Financial Crises, and since their tendencies and behavior generally suggested their preference for stability rather than growth, active communications with them would be important to prevent worsening of their sentiment.",
        "One other member stated the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level, given that, although the trend of growth in the fourth quarter was holding to the existing forecast overall, uncertainties at home and abroad surrounding future economic trends had grown further; given that, although consumer price movements were generally holding to the growth path forecast in October and the upward trend of consumer prices was expected to pick up, albeit at a modest pace, no small number of upside and downside risks were lurking and the movements of core inflation indicators were not well-balanced; and given that, although the slack in the production sector saw slight improvement and labor market conditions showed overall improvement, labor force slack was not low, particularly with respect to youth.",
        "The member then argued that, since shocks from the decoupling of the real and financial business cycles between advanced and emerging economies had produced a risk of greater instability in the credit market centered around non-blue-chip companies in weakened industries, monitoring of crisis transmission channels should be strengthened and emergency preparedness should be modified, and increasing leverage in the private sector should be preemptively managed at the macroprudential level.",
        "The member also put forward the view that, since harmony between macroprudential and structural reform policies had become more important, it was necessary to further strengthen cooperation and coordination among policy institutions to seek an optimal mix of those two policies.",
        "Meanwhile, one member mentioned that, taking into overall consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, while growth and prices remained generally on the path forecast last October, albeit subject to great uncertainty, financial stability risks had grown as the possibility of increased domestic and overseas financial market volatility had increased in line with a possible Fed rate hike in December, and as household lending was expected to continually show heightened growth, due mainly to increased housing sales prices and higher leasehold deposit prices, and to growth in group loans in line with the rise in the stock of new apartments available for sale.",
        "The member then argued that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to scrutinize the way macroeconomic and financial stability risks were likely to evolve in line with changes in domestic and overseas conditions, and in particular to keep a close watch on the US Fed’s monetary policy, and on changes in financial and economic conditions in China and other EMEs and their influences on the Korean finance sector and economy.",
        "Another member set out the view that, while holding the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period, going forward it was necessary to closely monitor the evolution of downside risks to the global economy, shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, trends of exports and domestic demand, and trends of fluctuation in Korea’s foreign exchange and financial markets, while seeking appropriate policy measures related to the above.",
        "After noting that the Bank of Korea should be on the alert to the possibility that credit risk aversion, which had increased in certain industries of late, may rapidly spread to other industries, the member argued that, while carrying out corporate restructuring without delay, the relevant policy authorities should make preemptive efforts to prevent the spread of funding difficulties of blue-chip companies and avert an excessive expansion of financial market volatility.",
        "The member noted that volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market had been relatively high compared with other countries, and the high volatility was likely to continue going forward due to the co-existence of factors causing the depreciation of the won, such as a US policy rate hike and the deepening economic slowdown in China, and factors causing the appreciation of the won, including a trend of surplus in the Korean current account and the expansion of monetary easing in major countries.",
        "The member went on to present the opinion that the foreign exchange policy authorities should therefore scrupulously and preemptively examine potential risk factors, while developing appropriate measures to bring about market stability under different possible scenarios.",
        "One other member noted, in view of overall financial and economic conditions domestically and overseas during the past month, domestic economic activity and price movements were judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in October, but the uncertainties surrounding external conditions, such as a possible policy rate hike by the Fed and the Chinese economic slowdown, had increased.",
        "The member then set out the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged this month while further strengthening the monitoring of growth in household debt, including group loans, and of corporate restructuring conditions.",
        "The member commented that, although employment presented a favorable picture, with the number of persons employed increasing and the employment-to-population ratio rising, youth employment remained weak as the educated unemployment problem deepened, and thus policy efforts should be strengthened to address this problem.",

        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery in the US had been sustained, particularly in the household sector, although US employment indicators had been somewhat sluggish.",
        "The moderate recovery in the euro area had continued, bolstered by increased production, while economic growth in China had continued to slow.",

        "They also noted that long-term market interest rates had fallen, in response mainly to declines in interest rates in major countries.",
        "They also pointed out that bank household lending had sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "With regard to prices, many members observed that consumer price inflation had come in at 0.6%, slightly lower than in the previous month, owing, for example, to an increase in the scale of decline in petroleum the Bank of Korea website.",
        "They noted that consumer price inflation was expected to remain at a low level for the time being.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member stated the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50%, given that, with the trend of recovery in domestic demand making up for sluggish exports, the economic movements in the second half of the year were holding to the existing forecast growth path and core inflation was also holding to the original forecast path; given that the capacity utilization gap in the manufacturing production sector had widened compared to the previous month and there was a significant broad unemployment gap in the labor market; given that, if a slowdown in the Chinese economy accelerated, there would be a possibility of increased volatility of capital flows and heightened synchronization among EMEs; and given that it was necessary to, from a macroprudential perspective, preemptively prepare against the pace of increase in lending, which greatly exceeds the trend of recovery in the Korean real economy.",
        "The member then argued that, since we could no longer postpone the implementation of structural reforms in the face of important challenges, such as making our economic structure more flexible and reconstructing our growth model, the monetary authorities should support structural reforms by managing the macroeconomy with an eye toward stability.",
        "The member also put forward the view that the monetary authorities should make efforts to communicate with economic agents and to carry out appropriate monetary policy based upon a thorough analysis of structural changes to the economy.",
        "Another member stated the view that, since sluggish exports were expected to continue in light of deteriorated global trade conditions and the very high share of exports in Korea’s GDP, exports were expected to curb economic growth rather than drive it, and thus, absent any special catalyst for growth, Korea is expected to face a new situation in which the GDP growth rate fluctuates around 3%.",
        "The member noted that, if economic growth is entrenched at around 3% and the function of prices as information variables is weakened, a social agreement on a sustainable potential growth rate has become more important than ever, because if the low growth rate has been caused by the weakening of the potential growth rate, monetary policy alone is limited in its ability to increase the potential growth rate.",
        "The member went on to present the opinion that the Bank of Korea should therefore accurately reflect conditions in the Korean economy when calculating the potential growth rate, and strengthen its efforts to determine the potential growth rate by receiving feedback from throughout the social spectrum.",
        "One other member took the view that, although the economic growth and inflation forecasts for 2015 and 2016 had been adjusted slightly downward, it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged this month while closely examining changes in the US Fed’s monetary policy and in emerging market economic conditions, trends of capital flows, and the pace of growth in household debt, given that there seemed to be no change in the macroeconomic trend ─ the domestic economy would continue to recover and inflation would accelerate gradually; given that financial market volatility was very likely to increase in light of the potential impact of external risks, such as the Fed’s policy rate hike; and given that the high rate of growth in household debt was expected to last for a considerable period of time, driven by increased housing sales, higher leasehold deposit prices, and growth in group loans in line with the rise in the stock of new apartments available for sale prior to the fourth quarter, which is the peak season for housing transactions.",
        "Meanwhile, one member mentioned that, taking into overall consideration changes in domestic and overseas financial and economic conditions, the trends for inflation and the domestic economy remained overall on the path forecast last July, but uncertainties surrounding domestic and external conditions remained high, and there were concerns about a possible destabilizing of financial markets due to capital outflows as unrest spread through global financial markets, and due to household debt growth.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to focus on strengthening the fundamental capacity of the domestic economy to enhance its potential growth rate.",
        "The member also presented the view that it would be advisable to strengthen communication with economic agents regarding the potential growth rate so that they could have a more objective view of the current state of the domestic economy.",
        "The member added that quantitative employment indicators, such as the number of persons employed and the unemployment rate, appeared favorable, but as there is plenty of room for improvement in qualitative terms, the analysis in this area should be strengthened.",
        "Another member noted that, on the external side, concerns remained about China and other emerging market economies despite the delay in the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization, and on the domestic side, there were signs of improvement in consumption and industrial production but a lack of confidence in the recovery of domestic demand, and downside risks to exports were expected to continue for the time being.",
        "The member went on to argue that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged this month and work to stabilize the sentiment of economic agents so that the current monetary and fiscal policies could take effect.",
        "The member mentioned that it would be necessary to clearly communicate whether the focus of diagnosis of, and prescription for, economic conditions would be placed upon a return to the potential growth rate, upon adaptation to the new normal, or upon responding to a new crisis.",
        "The member also noted that complex uncertainties that are hard to simplify and the risk of multiple equilibria should be taken into consideration in developing economic outlooks.",
        "The member went on to stress that, as the Korean economy was becoming sensitive to G2 risks, it would be necessary to objectively examine the theory that the Korean economy was coupling with that of China.",
        "The member also emphasized that attention should be paid to external risks, such as the continued outflows of foreign securities investment funds, as well as to financial stability risks, including increased private sector credit, heightened aversion to corporate credit risks, and the worsened soundness of the banking sector.",
        "The member added that efforts should be made to more strongly differentiate Korea from other emerging market countries and to set up a foreign exchange safety net.",
        "The member went on to mention that, with regard to the central bank’s role in the recovery of economic growth, its monetary policy should encourage the economic community to solve problems on its own, while maintaining the minimum level of growth and inflation stability.",
        "One other member set out the view that it would be desirable to carefully examine and analyze both the background and future trend of major variables critical to the growth and stability of the Korean economy, while holding the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member also argued that, in the current environment of unprecedented low inflation, the policy authorities should actively announce that corporate and household debtors might face a substantial interest burden even if the trend of low interest rates continues.",
        "Moreover, as the Korean won was under both upward and downward pressures, more careful attention should be paid to the possibility of greater volatility in the foreign exchange market.",
        "Notably, upward pressures on the Korean won would cause a slowdown in the performances of exporters, which would worsen the sluggishness in domestic demand and accelerate the decline in imports ─ outpacing that of exports.",
        "This would lead to a widening of the current account surplus, consequently giving rise to additional upward pressures on the Korean won.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that the relevant policy authorities should make every possible effort to keep a close watch on this trend and take appropriate responsive measures if needed.",

        "One member noted that prices were likely to sustain a very low rate of increase for the time being, influenced by the declines in international oil prices, and that the economy had shown no clear signs of recovery.",
        "He went on to argue that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period since, due mainly to seasonal factors, there was not enough data to judge the strength of the economic recovery, and there was also a need to further observe the effects of the government’s front-loading of its budget implementation and of the BOK’s Base Rate cuts.",
        "Another member, after agreeing on the desirability of leaving the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, observed that Korean exports to Japan and the EU had declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014, in line with the quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan and the ECB.",
        "It was now time, he suggested, to work actively to minimize the negative spillover effects of the yen‘s and the euro‘s depreciations on the Korean economy.",
        "The member added that the abrupt exchange rate fluctuations in the US dollar, the yen and the euro, stemming from policy divergences among major advanced country central banks, signified that the promises made at the Seoul G20 Summit in 2010 were no longer being followed, and expressed the view that, against this backdrop, Korea should not only seek actively to reduce exchange rate volatility, but also devote efforts to securing various possible policy tools.",
        "One other member, while expressing the opinion that it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, noted the need for paying close attention when adjusting the Base Rate, given that it was difficult to accurately grasp the underlying macroeconomic trends since major real economic indicators had recently been substantially influenced by irregular and seasonal factors, and it remained unclear how shifts in major countries’ monetary policies and the movements of international oil prices would affect domestic and overseas economic conditions.",
        "The member went on to state that effective measures should be sought to improve the quality of the household debt structure and curb growth in overall household debt outstanding, and that proposals for supporting the recovery of growth and expansion of the growth potential should be explored, depending on the situation, through the employment of policy instruments other than policy rate adjustment, such as the bank intermediation support facility.",
        "Another member meanwhile presented the view that, although in the present situation there was some scope for additional Base Rate adjustment given that the negative output and inflation gaps, which had widened in the fourth quarter of 2014, had not narrowed to any significant extent and that substantial spare capacities remained at firms and in the labor market, it would still be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged for the month, considering that the uncertainties about the effects of and potential risks related to Base Rate adjustment remained considerable.",
        "The member also noted that the fall in international oil prices and the spread of accommodative monetary policy stances would aggravate the downward pressures on prices, but on the other hand also have the effect of stimulating total demand.",
        "He added that the channels for revival of the Korean economic growth potential and for returning to the appropriate price level needed to be examined closely, while also strengthening the macroprudential supervisory framework through cooperation among the related authorities with regard to financial stability risks including the increase in household debt.",
        "He at the same time stated that the economy’s resilience must be heightened through efforts to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, by for example enlarging the corporate restructuring functions of creditor financial institutions.",
        "Another member stated, taking domestic and overseas financial and economic conditions into overall consideration, that on the overseas side the paces of improvement in economic activities were weak in major countries apart from the U.S., and future economic uncertainties had increased due mainly to expectations of a U.S. policy rate hike, to the expansions in major countries’ monetary policy accommodativeness, to political instability in Greece and to the shock of low oil prices, while on the domestic side exports were somewhat feeble, the recovery of domestic demand was sluggish and the pace of improvement in economic agents’ sentiment was weak.",
        "After advocating that the Base Rate be held at its current level for the inter-meeting period, he added his view that attention needed to be paid to changes in global conditions, while growth- and price-related macroeconomic risks should be considered together with the risks to financial stability, in a balanced manner, to ensure that vulnerabilities related to the growth path did not materialize.",
        "One other member assessed the recent changes in the economic environments at home and abroad as calling for comprehensive examination of the appropriateness of the current Base Rate level, and added that, while holding the rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Committee should keep close watch on the future impacts of the accommodative monetary policies in major countries, the downside risks to exports and domestic demand, the trend of increasing household debt, the development of the low inflation situation, in/outflows of foreign capital and foreign exchange market trends, in order to seek the optimal policy response.",
        "He went on to note that, as the Korean economy was vulnerable to external sector disturbances owing to its high degree of market openness and external dependency, the possibility was high of the recent monetary policy easing by major countries causing substantial volatility in the Korean economy, and the policy authorities should therefore prepare against such shocks in advance.",
        "The member then added that it was necessary to strengthen measures for countering the excessive growth of household debt, to carry out structural innovation of the economy and to construct new engines of growth.",

        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries’ monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic growth in the US had been sustained, driven by consumption and exports, and that the pattern of mild improvement in the euro area and Japan had continued.",
        "Meanwhile, economic uncertainty in China had increased with growth continuing to slow.",
        "Members judged that investor sentiment concerning emerging market economies had contracted greatly in international financial markets, owing chiefly to expectations of the US Fed’s policy rate hike and to the unrest in the Chinese equity markets.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members noted that, while the economy showed modest economic recovery due to the waning of the effects of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, exports had continued to decline.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members observed that stock prices had fallen and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, chiefly under the influence of outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds.",
        "They also noted that foreign exchange market volatility had risen greatly, affected by the devaluation of the Chinese yuan.",
        "With regard to prices, members observed that, despite the reduction in on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "electricity tariffs, consumer price inflation had still come in at 0.7%, the same as that of the month previous, owing, for example, to hikes in public transport fares.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was 2.0%, also the same as that of the preceding month.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member assessed that, although domestic economic activity and price movements had evidenced some heightening of uncertainty due to increasing volatility in the external sector, they were judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in July.",
        "The member then went on to state his view that the Board should hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He argued, however, that a close watch should be kept on spillover effects from the devaluation of the yuan in the future, since volatility had been mounting with outflows of foreign portfolio investment funds, and stock prices and the exchange rate fluctuating greatly, influenced by the international financial market unrest.",
        "The member also argued that the Board should do all it could to manage external sector risk by refining and updating its contingency plans in readiness for any sudden reversal of capital flows.",
        "Another member stated his view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "He pointed out that, although foreign portfolio investment funds had experienced large outflows in July and the won had depreciated against the dollar, this was attributable to a weakening of the won in line with the global strength of the US dollar, and to some EMEs’ need to secure foreign currency liquidity, rather than to changes in Korea’s economic fundamentals.",
        "He then went on to express the view that, since Korea was running a large current account surplus, provided domestic real economic and international economic conditions did not deviate greatly from their expected trajectory, the possibilities of massive foreign portfolio investment fund outflows and a consequent rapid weakening of the Korean won could be largely discounted.",
        "He went on to argue that, given these circumstances, the sharp depreciation of the Korean won, prompted by the abrupt devaluation of the Chinese yuan, appeared to be attributable to excessive herd behavior on the part of economic agents.",
        "Appropriate management of this state of affairs was thus called for and there should be unflagging efforts to lessen exchange rate volatility.",
        "One other member took the view that while, despite the high degree of uncertainty, growth and consumer prices were not seen to be deviating far from the path forecast last July, risks in terms of financial stability were considered to have grown, with household lending maintaining strong growth and stock prices and exchange rates showing heightened volatility due mainly to outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds, affected chiefly by expectations of the US Fed’s policy rate hike and financial and economic instability in vulnerable emerging market countries.",
        "The member elaborated this by stating that in his opinion while keeping the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank should redouble its focus on the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization process and the movements of the Chinese yuan’s exchange rate, and the likely reverberations these two factors would have for the Korean financial and real economic sectors － in/outflows of foreign investment funds and movements of price variables such as interest and exchange rates.",
        "Meanwhile, one member stated his belief that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged this month.",
        "He argued that although the growth path for the second half was expected to remain as originally forecast, the upward and downward uncertainties surrounding the growth path were growing even further due to domestic and external factors.",
        "Meanwhile, the significant month-on-month increase in core inflation and the gradual easing of instability in inflation expectations were attributable more to supply-side factors than demand-side ones.",
        "A careful watch was therefore needed on the underlying trend of demand-side inflation pressures.",
        "Apart from this, the slack in the production sector showed little sign of improvement and that in the employment sector was widening somewhat.",
        "The member added that more attention needed to be paid to risk factors, including the possibility of capital outflows, shrugging off Korean economic fundamentals, accelerating to a greater extent than expected in line with changes in global risk conditions, the possibility of a further Chinese economic slowdown and additional yuan depreciation, and the burgeoning household indebtedness showing strong pro-cyclicality to the accelerating upward momentum of the housing market.",
        "Another member stated his view that financial stability risks including household debt should be monitored closely, holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, keeping a close watch on the effects of monetary easing policies and expansion of fiscal expenditure, and paying attention to changes in global financial and economic conditions, the extent of their spillover effects on the Korean financial markets and economy and whether economic agents were regaining their confidence.",
        "The member argued that, in order for the Korean economy to shift toward one based on innovation, it would be necessary to break with the incrementalist approach and address future tasks on the basis of clear perspectives and groundbreaking measures.",
        "The member went on to present as immediate challenges the examination of emerging market economy risks and pursuit of measures to counter them, the stable management of long-term interest rates and exchange rates, and the in-depth analysis of the Chinese economy, and stressed the necessity of promoting the upgrading of the monetary policy framework to effectively handle the changes in domestic and external conditions, developing new employment-related statistics while constructing a framework for the assessment of employment indicators-based economic trends, and conducting research on the effects of the spread of electronic payment services and the entry of specialist Internet banks and make preparations in readiness.",
        "One other member also set out his views as to the desirability of holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed the four Base Rate cuts since the second half of last year as having contributed to enhancing the vigor of the Korean economy by improving corporate and households’ access to loans and lessening the lending rate burden.",
        "He mentioned that, although in the course of this the excessive growth of household debt had imposed a burden on the operation of the easing policy, it would be advisable to address this through macro-prudential rather than monetary policy.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that while the comprehensive household debt management measure that the government had recently announced was expected to have some limited effect, more aggressive measures should be taken additionally without hesitation as and when they were called for.",
        "The member also stressed that the monetary authority should examine all possible policy measures and consider how to implement them in response to the slow growth and low inflation dragging on.",
        "Meanwhile, the member emphasized that, as volatility would very likely increase in the financial and foreign exchange markets given the gathering expectations of the US Fed’s hike of interest rates at an early stage, the dollars’ global strength, the possibility of major countries’ competitive currency devaluations and the prospects for the Korean economy’s huge current account surplus, the financial authorities should keep a close watch on financial and foreign exchange market trends and if and when needed employ policy measures to ensure orderly market in a timely manner.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well.",
        "Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and to the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.",

        "On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in July maintained the same level as that during July of last year, but the trend of increase in the number of persons employed slowed and, due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, the unemployment rate rose compared to that in July last year.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, owing chiefly to the expansionary macroeconomic policies and to the ending of the MERS outbreak, but judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",

        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of low oil prices.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment regarding the global economy was that it was sustaining a recovery, albeit a weak one, with some economic indicators in the US and emerging market countries having improved, but that the downside risks to growth were still large.",
        "Most members assessed the domestic economy as having recently shown signs of a weak but modest recovery, with domestic demand and exports having picked up starting from October.",
        "As to the outlook, although exports were likely to improve somewhat with the economies of Korea’s major trading partners recovering moderately, most members anticipated that it would take some time for domestic demand to return to a full-blown trend of recovery, influenced for instance by the pullback in confidence due to uncertainties at home and abroad, by the rise in household debt, and by the slumps in construction and housing market activities.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, some members pointed out that long-term market interest rates had rebounded slightly on the weakening of expectations of additional Base Rate cuts, eliminating the inversion of the yield curve, that stock prices had undergone a mild correction, and that the Korean won had shown steep appreciation against the US dollar due mostly to the sustained current account surplus and to inflows of liquidity from overseas.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Most members anticipated that inflation would remain on a stable path for the time being, owing primarily to the economic slowdown and to the stability of petroleum product prices.",
        "One of these members, however, put forward the opinion that the possibility needed to be borne in mind of factors such as the still high expected inflation and the unstable international grain prices working to destabilize prices.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, commented on recent economic developments as follows, and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: While inflation and employment appeared stable, some real economy indicators such as production and consumption were recovering somwhat, as were exports.",
        "Factors destabilizing to the economy remained, however, as external uncertainties persisted including the concerns about slowdown of the world economy and the electoral timetables in major countries.",
        "While closely monitoring economic conditions at home and abroad, the government planned to strengthen its policy measures to enhance economic dynamism, and to continue its efforts to stabilize the livelihoods of the low-income brackets and upgrade the fabric of the economy.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, as inflation was expected to be stable for some time while the pace of growth in economic activity was weak, it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while closely examining the effects of the two rate cuts since last July together with major countries’ policy responses and their spillover effects.",
        "Some members expressed the opinion that since demand for high-risk, high-return products had been increasing recently due to the low interest rate environment, financial market volatility could spike substantially and would undermine financial stability if conditions should worsen.",
        "Therefore, they argued that it was necessary to look comprehensively into the impacts of the low interest rates on financial institutions’ profitability and on their sources and uses of funds, and to examine the related risks.",
        "In line with this, another member presented the opinion that there was a need as well to pay attention to and keep watch on the impacts of the low interest rates on the expansion of household debt, the inversion of the yield curve, foreign capital in- and outflows, etc.",
        "One other member, meanwhile, pointed out that there is a need for the central bank to concentrate its capacity to propose plans for boosting the economy’s medium- and long-term growth potential, and that to address the recent slowing of growth, measures making active use of its relatively flexible Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans should be drawn up.",

        "As to the current state of the domestic economy, most members evaluated its growth momentum as still being weak, although some real economic indicators showed slight improvements going into April compared to the previous month.",
        "In addition, most members judged that, with destabilizing external factors including the sovereign debt problems in the euro area and economic sluggishness in major countries persisting for a long time, the timing of GDP growth rate’s return to trend was very likely to be delayed longer than expected.",
        "One among these members assessed that the pace of growth through the public sector would also weaken by the reduction in the government’s fiscal spending in the latter half-year.",
        "Members noted with regard to the domestic financial markets that volatility had increased with the outflows of foreign stock investment funds, the decline in stock prices and interest rates, and the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar, due to concerns about worsening global economic conditions.",
        "One member, however, evaluated the prospect of an abrupt exodus of foreign investment funds to be low, English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "since foreign bond investors were maintaining a net buying trend and stock sales were also found to have been strongly driven by profit taking.",
        "Although consumer price inflation had shown stable movements at the mid-2% level for a third consecutive month, due largely to the impact of the government’s free childcare support and to lower international oil prices, members pointed out that vigilance against rising prices could not be lowered, given the hikes in public utility fees in the second half of 2012, the high level of expected inflation and the possibility of wage hikes.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: With regard to recent economic activity in Korea, the 1[st] Vice Minister pointed out that, although the stable trend in employment continued and real economy indicators had improved somewhat, indices for assessing economic activity appeared subdued, and that although prices showed stable movements, destabilizing factors still existed, centering around the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and processed foods.",
        "He in addition forecast that the current account would sustain its surplus as in April, even though exports had recorded negative growth in May owing mostly to reduced global demand and to the base effect.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, although the domestic economy appeared to be sustaining its recovery, albeit weakly, it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, considering that inflationary pressures remained and that uncertainty had mounted somewhat due to recent changes in the domestic and international environments.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it was necessary to maintain the interest rate normalization stance in order to ensure solid economic growth and to make room for policy action in the future, since the current level of the Base Rate could still be deemed accommodative because it was far lower than prior to the global financial crisis.",
        "Another member mentioned that it was necessary to closely review the effectiveness of the interest rate policy transmission mechanism, considering for instance that price variable volatility had grown and the yield curve flattend significantly due to destabilizing external factors.",
        "One other member pointed out the need to examine the effectiveness and capacity of fiscal policy, which along with monetary policy forms the two main pillars of macroeconomic policy.",
        "As regards financial stability, some members expressed the view that efforts should be made to examine the effects of the existing measures to reduce capital flow volatility, and to maintain comfortable foreign exchange supply and demand conditions, given that Korea’s foreign exchange and financial markets were vulnerable to sudden reversals of foreign investment fund flows in events of external shock.",
        "Another member opined that there was a need to even out the maturity distribution of household debt, since there was a possibility of a vicious circle being set in motion between souring household loans, particularly those extended to older age groups, and real estate market instability.",

        "One member assessed the downside risks to world economic growth to be expanding, due to the continued international financial market instability.",
        "As to the domestic economy, members mentioned that domestic demand and exports were somewhat more sluggish than originally forecast, affected mostly by the persistence of destabilizing external factors and the consequent pullback in consumer and investor sentiment.",
        "In addition, most members’ outlook on the economy was that it would remain in a downturn for the time being, owing to the heightened uncertainty of global economic conditions.",
        "One of them expressed concerns that uncertainties as to the growth path had risen even further with the addition of geopolitical risks related to Iran and North Korea, and that if various structural problems latent in the Korean economy surfaced under these circumstances, it could make the maintenance of financial market stability and economic growth difficult.",

        "Regarding consumer prices, members noted that headline consumer price inflation had come in at 4.2% in December, as in the previous month, driven by hikes in agricultural and livestock and petroleum product prices.",
        "One of them expected that the rate of consumer price increase would decline gradually, due mostly to the base-period effect and the easing of demand-side inflation pressures, but that its pace of decline would be moderate owing to high inflation expectations.",
        "As for housing prices, one member appraised those in Seoul and its surrounding areas as having continued their fall, as in the previous month, while the pace of their increase in the rest of the country had slowed, due chiefly to burdens stemming from their previous rapid surge.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister assessed that, although major real economic indicators were weak, some indicators which had shown sluggishness were recovering somewhat, amid the continuing pattern of improvement in employment.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister pointed out however that uncertainty about economic conditions was increasing, with the emergence of geopolitical risks in North Korea at a time when the possibility of the euro area sovereign debt crisis spreading lingered.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister commented that although headline consumer price inflation for 2012 was expected to register 3.2%, lower than in the previous year, concerns might arise that growing demand for commodities in emerging market countries, destabilizing factors on the supply side arising from the political unrest in the Middle East including Iran and from the possibility of abnormal changes in weather, and high core inflation and expected inflation might act as inflation pressures.",
        "Concerning employment trends, the 1st Vice Minister judged the trend of recovery in the labor market to be continuing, with the number of persons employed having increased by 440,000 year-on-year in December.",
        "He also commented that, with employment elasticity (the rate of growth in number of persons employed divided by GDP growth) improving greatly, the Korean economy’s job creation capacity was improving, and major employment indicators such as the employment rate, the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate were also improving compared to 2011.",
        "He pointed out, however, that, since there was a possibility of the employment recovery being limited this year compared to last, due to slowing growth and the consequent reduction in job gains, there was a need for more job creation in order to restore employment conditions, which had deteriorated greatly due to the global financial crisis, to their pre-crisis level.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in view of the situation in which the trend of domestic economic slowdown was becoming evident, and the uncertainties as to economic conditions and the growth path at home and abroad were higher than ever, even though the inflation situation was still difficult due mostly to the high level of expected inflation and the possibility of a run-up in international oil prices.",
        "One of these members noted that, although the Committee should hold the Base Rate at its current level, it should work to curb rate cut expectations while signaling to the market that the negative real interest rate situation will have to be normalized as soon as possible.",
        "The member added that the Committee should seek a way to promote harmony with the economic policies of the government, whose top priorities were placed upon price stability and job creation.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that the Committee should attempt to normalize rates without delay once improvements in economic circumstances at home and abroad were confirmed, since adverse side effects of the long period of low level interest rates due to accommodative monetary policy were emerging, such as mounting household debt and delays in corporate restructuring.",
        "And he raised that concerns about market efficiency and appropriate resource allocation might be hampered as a consequence, leading thereby to a weakening of the Korean economy’s growth potential.",
        "The member argued in addition that it was necessary to push forward with market-driven corporate restructuring, while at the same time coming up with social and economic solutions to the problems facing low-income vulnerable households.",
        "One other member pointed out that government efforts were needed at the micro-level to prevent recurrence of the factors that had fueled the rise in core inflation last year, such as multiple supply shocks, a rise in expected inflation, hikes in personal service charges, and the strengthened degree of inflation persistence.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: The assessment of many members regarding the global economy was that, although the international financial market unrest showed signs of easing, owing mostly to the expansion of the ECB’s long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) and the improvements in U.S. economic indicators, the real economy was exhibiting signs of weakening growth due the contraction of economic activity in the euro area and the slowing of emerging market countries’ exports.",
        "One of these members mentioned that the global liquidity, expanded through additional easing by major central banks, had flowed into commodity markets, pushing up prices for raw materials, including international oil, which was very likely to curb world economic growth.",
        "In regard to the domestic economy, members judged its pace of growth to be breaking out of its sluggishness somewhat, with consumption and facilities investment improving and exports expanding.",
        "One member noted, however, that it was rather premature to consider the improvements in some economic indicators as implying a shift to economic recovery from the second half of this year, and that no clear momentum driving an economic recovery domestically was seen.",
        "As to the outlook, some members forecast that the domestic economy would improve gradually from the second half onward as the uncertainties about external conditions eased, although it would be difficult to expect a rapid recovery since risk factors still remained, including the euro area sovereign debt problems and the cumulative increase in household debt.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members commented that stock prices had risen and the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, mostly on the easing of risk aversion tendencies and inflows of foreign investors’ funds.",
        "One of these members pointed out that attention should be paid to the possibility of foreign investor fund in- and outflow volatility expanding going forward, depending for example on how the euro area fiscal problems evolved.",
        "Regarding consumer prices, members remarked that headline consumer price inflation had come in at 3.1% in February, lower than in the previous month, helped mostly by a base-period effect and declines in the prices of livestock products.",
        "One member on the other hand assessed inflationary pressures as having rather increased further, since international oil prices had risen much more than originally forecast and public utility charge hikes were on the horizon, while expected inflation had been running above the 4% level for eight consecutive months.",
        "As for housing prices, one member mentioned that they remained sluggish in Seoul and its surrounding areas and their pace of increase in the rest of the country had slowed down.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1[st] Vice Minister commented that, although construction investment was sluggish and the coincident composite index seen to have fallen, the trend of employment growth was continuing and major real economic indicators improving— boosted for instance by the impact of the Lunar New Year having fallen in January rather than in February.",
        "He pointed out on the other hand that the situation was one in which the uncertainty arising from the run-up in international oil prices was rapidly mounting, amid continued fears of a global economic slowdown centering around Europe.",
        "The 1[st] Vice Minister forecast that, although the rate of increase in consumer prices had fallen somewhat month-on-month in February, factors such as international oil price hikes resulting from the sanctions against Iran, and international financial market volatility triggered by the European fiscal crisis, would work to destabilize prices in the future.",
        "Concerning the trends of external transactions, the 1[st] Vice Minister remarked that exports had increased 22.7% year-on-year in February, buoyed mostly by the increase in number of days worked due to the movement of the Lunar New Year to January and the waning of after-effects from the concentration of exports at the year-end.",
        "He meanwhile estimated that the current account, which had posted a deficit of 0.77 billion dollars this year, would shift to a surplus for February, bolstered for instance by a trade account surplus and an improvement in the services account.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, agreeing that now was the time to examine the conditions for conducting monetary policy by keeping a watch on the evolution of the European sovereign debt crisis, the impacts of international oil prices on the real economies at home and abroad and on prices, and the policy effects of additional quantitative easing by major countries, etc.",
        "One of these members commented that, although the current level of Base Rate remained accommodative, a rise in it at this juncture, when the pace of economic slowdown was finally starting to ease, might aggravate economic activity further, entailing risks of an expansion in the amplitude of economic fluctuations.",
        "He went on to note that inflows of the abundant global liquidity had recently increased, and pointed out that special attention was warranted since the possibility of their causing excessive credit expansion and increases in asset prices was high, and since it was feared that they might reverse to sudden outflows in the event of changes in conditions at home or abroad.",
        "Another member noted that efforts should be exerted to preemptively block the possibility of expected inflation working as a factor amplifying the second-round effects from supply shocks, and that there was a need to develop more active communication strategies, particularly given that the scope for operation of interest rate policy was limited.",
        "He also asserted that, for a fundamental solution to the household debt problem, comprehensive and multi-dimensional proposals should be explored—that could bring about a division of roles and policy coordination among the various economic policy authorities overseeing not just financial supervisory policy but also other policies such as monetary, fiscal and employment policies.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, the members decided unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have sustained their trends of improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish.",
        "Growth in emerging market economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports.",
        "Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be moderate, and judges that risk factors still exist, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and geopolitical risks in the Middle East.",
        "Although construction investment has been sluggish, consumption and facilities investment have increased and exports have shown a steady expansion.",
        "On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector.",
        "The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend level going forward, although viewing downside risks as likely to remain high for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors.",
        "petroleum product prices, owing to declines in the prices of livestock products, and core inflation, which excludes the prices of non-grain agricultural products and petroleum products, also dropped compared to the previous month.",
        "In the coming months, factors including the easing of demand-side pressures will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee recognizes the presence of potentially destabilizing factors such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East.",
        "In the housing market, prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposits there rose.",
        "The rates of increase in housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country fell somewhat compared to the month before.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment regarding the global economy was that it was sustaining a recovery, albeit a weak one, with some economic indicators in the US and emerging market countries having improved, but that the downside risks to growth were still large.",
        "Many members pointed out that, although the international financial markets remained stable overall, largely on the agreement to resume the financial rescue package for Greece, the possibility of market instability recurring remained.",
        "Most members assessed the domestic economy as continuing on a weak pace of growth, with the sluggishness of domestic demand persisting despite the ongoing trend of improvement in the exports sector.",
        "Concerning the outlook, members anticipated that the economy would show a modest recovery led by exports.",
        "Some members, however, foresaw the negative output gap lingering on for a considerable time, owing to the slow pace of economic recovery.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to the sustained current account surplus and to inflows of liquidity from overseas, and that market interest rates and stock prices had shown upward movements on the easing of international financial market unrest and weakening expectations of additional Base Rate cuts.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Many members noted that, helped by the stability of international commodity and agricultural product prices, consumer price inflation was running at the mid-1% range, and they forecast that it would remain low for some time to come.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, commented on recent economic developments as follows, and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: While domestic inflation and employment appeared stable, production and exports had improved, but consumption, investment and other domestic demand-related indicators were sluggish.",
        "As for the world economy, with concerns persisting about its slowdown, uncertainties lingered due largely to the delays in recovery of consumer and investor sentiment.",
        "The government will respond to factors making for price instability preemptively and strengthen its drive for structural improvement, and continue its policy efforts to boost the economy and create jobs.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and closely watch changes in the financial and economic environments at home and abroad, given that the sluggishness of domestic economic growth was not intensifying any further, and that the economic conditions at home and abroad continued to remain in an unsteady state while inflation was expected to show stability for some time, although the pace of growth in domestic economic activity was still weak.",
        "Some of these members expressed the opinion that policy efforts should be directed toward curbing sudden in- and outflows of speculative capital, since, in view of various features of the Korean financial markets including their high degree of openness and asymmetrical structure, the recent excessive inflows of global liquidity were highly likely to impose a greater economic burden on Korea than on any other country.",
        "Another member asserted that, since there were some indications of a differentiation in terms of credit quality between firms among those issuing the higher-grade corporate bonds that had been preferred for some time as prime paper, it was necessary to monitor this closely to prevent the spread of credit risk aversion from acting as a factor making for financial instability, while fine-tuning its policy instruments to stage a preemptive response.",
        "One other member pointed out that, given the concerns about the growth potential being eroded by the continuation of low growth, there was a necessity of preparing against such a hysteresis effect becoming entrenched by reviewing the macro and micro cycles in a timely manner.",

        "Furthermore, many members mentioned that the world economy was forecast to exhibit a very moderate recovery going forward, but that the downside risks to growth were still large.",
        "Most members noted that the domestic economy was continuing its weak growth, as exports remained on a trend of decline and domestic demand appeared lackluster.",
        "As to the outlook, most members commented that it would take some time for the economy to return to its long-term trend level, since on top of it seeming to be difficult for exports to recover any time soon, due mainly to the economic slumps of Korea’s major trading partners, private consumption similarly remained constrained by the worsening of consumer sentiment in response to the mounting external uncertainties.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, many members assessed the stock, bond and foreign exchange markets to have all exhibited stable movements, with the soothing of market sentiment and inflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds driven chiefly by the additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries and Korea’s sovereign rating upgrade.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "A majority of members forecast that the inflation rate would remain at a stable level below the midpoint of its target for the time being, with the easing of inflationary pressures owing primarily to the economic slowdown and to international oil price stability.",

        "Meanwhile, one member noted that real estate prices had continued to decline, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, commented on recent economic developments as follows, and then left the room before the Base Rate was decided: Amid ongoing concerns about the slowdown of the world economy, real economic indicators were subdued with the recovery in domestic consumer and investor sentiments being delayed.",

        "The underlying surplus in the current account was forecast to have been sustained in September as well.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members expressed the opinion that it would be best to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level that month, to underpin the recoveries of economic activity and growth engines, as the situation was one in which growth was forecast to fall significantly on lackluster domestic demand and declining exports, while upward price pressures remained low.",
        "Some of these members noted that if, together with the Base Rate cut, the low interest rate conditions were to become prevalent, the tendencies toward excessive preference for risk assets such as commercial paper and toward a concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market were likely to intensify, and that there was thus a need going forward to redouble the efforts to curb moral hazard and excessive risk-taking on the parts of the economic agents concerned.",
        "Another member pointed out the need to prepare against the possibilities of capital inflows led by hot money, and appreciation of the Korean won, in consequence of the additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries.",
        "One other member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level even though the pace of growth in the Korean economy was observed to have decelerated considerably, since its growth potential was not deemed to have been impaired yet and there was a need as well to preserve space for interest rate policy in preparation for a time when even more difficult conditions might unfold in the future.",
        "With regard to the recent slowdown in growth, he also noted that there was a need to respond first with tailored credit policies, by way for instance of improvements in the Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loan system, and together with this to press ahead with progressive structural reforms aimed at boosting the economy’s growth potential.",

        "As to the outlook, while expecting the domestic economy to sustain growth at its long-term trend level, some members judged that the risk was also not small of it going into a downtrend due mainly to the high level of international oil prices and heightened financial market volatility, etc.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, one member pointed out English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "that they generally presented a pattern of stability, with concerns about the domestic economy and prices easing somewhat, but had been exhibiting signs of greater volatility since the beginning of April in line largely with the sluggish U.S. employment indicators and resurgence of fiscal problems in some European countries.",
        "Regarding consumer prices, members commented that consumer price inflation had slowed from the previous month to register 2.6% in March, helped mostly by the expansion of government subsidies for childcare fees and free school meals.",
        "Most members pointed out, however, that attention should be given to the fact that upward price pressures were still high, due to demand-pull factors arising from the improved economy, to the elevated inflation expectations, and to destabilizing factors like geopolitical risks in the Middle East, etc.",
        "As for housing prices, one member mentioned that they had remained on a downward path for five consecutive months in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and their pace of increase in the rest of the country had not accelerated.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1[st] Vice Minister assessed major real economic indicators, such as production and consumption, to have been improving, while the trend of employment recovery continued.",
        "He pointed out, however, that the situation was one in which growth in production appeared to be concentrated in certain sectors amid a slight sluggishness in facilities investment.",
        "The 1[st] Vice Minister mentioned that headline inflation had fallen to the 2% range for the first time in 19 months in March this year.",
        "Concerning future price conditions, he indicated that it was too soon to relax due to the numerous uncertainties, such as international oil prices and unstable agricultural product prices.",
        "At the same time, he forecast the possibility of factors making for price instability materializing after April, particularly when the hikes in price of raw materials and oil were reflected in public utility charges, fees for personal services and industrial product prices.",
        "Regarding the trend of external transactions going forward, the 1[st] Vice Minister remarked that while exports of major items such as automobiles and petroleum products had run smoothly in March, total exports had declined 1.4% year-on-year, owing mostly to the base effect and the difference in the numbers of days worked.",
        "He commented on the other hand that imports had fallen 1.2% year-on-year in March, due to reduced imports of raw materials and capital goods.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that both economic and price conditions appeared to be improving month-on-month recently, but it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, considering that downside risks to growth and factors making for price instability were latent, and that the uncertainties concerning conditions overseas persisted.",
        "One member noted that, although the current level of the Base Rate could still be termed accommodative, it was feared that its rise at this juncture when economic uncertainty had become more acute due to the recurrence of European fiscal crisis could again worsen business activity which was just showing stirrings of improvement, and widen the amplitude of business fluctuations.",
        "He went on to point out that, since the negative effects of low interest rates, such as increased leveraging by households and businesses and the postponement of corporate restructuring, had intensified with the Base Rate being kept low for an extended period, there should be no delay in seeking interest rate normalization once signs of the instability at home and abroad easing to some degree were confirmed.",
        "Another member argued that the recent sluggishness in private sector consumption was attributable mainly to structural factors―whereby household financial conditions worsened as essential consumption expenditure increased amid the growing imbalance in income distribution between businesses and households―and since this was also related, directly and indirectly, to various issues confronting the Korean economy, there was a need to focus policy capacity on improving the household sector’s wherewithal to consume.",
        "Meanwhile, one other member expressed the view that there was a possibility of the real estate market in Seoul and its surrounding areas becoming greatly depressed, with transactions slumping and a reversal of the shortage in leasehold units appearing, and that attention to this was therefore needed.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, the members decided unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: In regard to the global economy, members assessed the uncertainties in the international financial markets to be showing signs of easing somewhat, owing mostly to cooperation among euro area countries and stronger policy responses by major countries, but the pace of world economic growth to have fallen more than originally anticipated—due mainly to the downward revision of the outlook for economic growth in the U.S., the prospects for negative second half growth in the euro area, and the slowdown of growth in emerging market countries including China—with the risk of global growth declining further.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members noted that the overall economic recovery was presenting a more subdued pattern than had been expected, as growth in domestic demand such as private consumption and facilities investment remained low with exports showing signs of losing momentum even though they were still on a par with the year before.",
        "As to the outlook, many members anticipated that, considersing the uncertainties in the external sector and the weak recovery in the domestic demand sector, the economy would show a very modest recovery and assessed the return of the growth path to its long-term trend as highly likely to be delayed for a considerable time.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, some members pointed out that, although the Korean won had appreciated against the U.S. dollar English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "and inflows and outflows of portfolio investment funds also appeared to be gaining stability, boosted by the easing of international financial market uncertainties, the state of yield curve inversion had grown more intensified—with government bond yields having fallen sharply under the influence of the global and domestic economic slowdowns and expectations of a Base Rate cut—while bank deposit and lending rates also seemed to be on a downward track.",
        "Related to consumer prices, members forecast that, despite the presence of potentially destabilizing factors such as the high expected inflation and public utility rate hikes, prices would remain on a stable track for the time being since the upward pressures on both the supply and demand sides had eased, largely in response to the shift to a negative output gap caused by the economic sluggishness and to the declines in international commodity prices.",
        "Meanwhile, one member mentioned that real estate prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas while their uptrend in the rest of the country was subsiding to some degree, and that their pace would slow further in the coming months—mostly on the weakening economic recovery and the expansion in supply of apartments, particularly small and medium-sized units.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members expressed the view that, given the situation in which domestic economic activity was more sluggish than expected and the downside risks to the future growth path also predominated amid the apparent stabilization of prices, it would be best to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the month ahead, to underpin the recoveries of economic activity and growth engines.",
        "Some among these members commented that they judged the negative effects on inflation expectations and household debt as unlikely to be large, while assessing that a Base Rate cut this month would contribute to relieving the financial burdens of the vulnerable and promoting a normal flow of funds in the financial markets.",
        "Some other members pointed out that, it was also necessary to examine micro-level measures for vulnerable sectors such as SMEs and lower-income earners since interest rate policy alone may have limitations in stimulating the economy besides devoting a lot of attention to the various structural problems weakening the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and working to alleviate them.",
        "Meanwhile, one other member expressed the view that holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period was advisable, since it seemed more necessary to reserve sufficient policy capacity in preparation for future hardships than to attempt a short-term economic recovery, in a situation in which the trend of low growth was expected to continue for a considerable time going forward.",
        "He in addition voiced the opinion that it would be desirable to respond to the recent deceleration of growth with credit policies, by for example improving the aggregate credit ceiling system, and that the development of new policy tools beyond the traditional monetary policy instruments was required in order to prepare for any future worsening of domestic and external conditions.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, the members decided by a majority vote to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.00% from its current 3.25% for the intermeeting period.",

        "Growth in emerging market countries as well has continued to slow, mostly on sluggish exports.",
        "Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be more moderate than originally forecast, and judges the downside risks to growth to be intensifying further, due chiefly to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the euro area fiscal crisis and to the possibilities of international financial market unrest and economic slumps in major countries.",

        "The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will sustain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the increase in euro area risks and the sluggish economies of its major trading partners.",
        "The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain below the midpoint of the inflation target for the time being, despite pressures to hike public utility fees for instance.",
        "In the housing market, sales prices remained weak and leasehold deposits maintained their levels of the previous month in Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "The uptrends of both sales and leasehold deposit prices in the rest of the country slowed.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Regarding the global economy, many members commented that stock and bond prices were rising and inflows of portfolio investment funds to emerging market countries becoming prominent, as the tendency toward risk aversion in the international financial markets was weakened somewhat due to the strengthening of major central banks’ stances of monetary policy easing.",
        "Most members assessed however that the advanced economies were continuing to exhibit sluggishness, particularly in the euro area, notwithstanding the improvements in some U.S. economic indicators, and that economies of emerging market countries including China had been showing signs of weakening in their real economic growth.",
        "One of these members forecast that, even if the uncertainty over the euro area sovereign debt problem did ease somewhat, world economic growth was unlikely to expand greatly owing mostly to major advanced countries’ efforts to restore fiscal soundness.",
        "In regard to the domestic economy, members mentioned that the slowdown in domestic economic growth appeared to be continuing, due to the persistence of external destabilizing factors and the consequent pullback in consumer and investment confidence.",
        "As to the outlook, the majority of members forecast that domestic economic activity could shift to a recovery, albeit a modest one, on the back of the economy’s sound fundamentals, provided the uncertainties about external conditions decline from the second half of this year.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members observed that stock prices had risen sharply, the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, and the volatility of price variables declined, thanks to the easing of international financial market unrest.",
        "Some of them pointed out that attention should have to be paid to the possibility of the recent inflows of foreign investors’ portfolio funds shifting to a sudden outflow in the event of changes in domestic and international conditions.",
        "Regarding consumer prices, members noted that headline consumer price inflation had come in at 3.4% in January, much lower than in the previous month, due mostly to a base-period effect and the blunting of the upward pressures on agricultural and livestock prices.",
        "Some of them anticipated that although factors including the moderation of demand-side pressures due to the economic slowdown and base period effects would work in favor of price stability, the pace of decline in the inflation rate would be very moderate in the coming months due mostly to factors such as ongoing high inflation expectations, the run-up in international oil prices in line with geopolitical risks in the Middle East, and the pressures for public utility charge hikes.",
        "As for housing prices, one member assessed that those in Seoul and its surrounding areas had continued their fall from the previous month, while their pace of increase in the rest of the country had slowed.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister assessed that major real economic indicators such as mining and manufacturing production were sluggish, although the trend of employment growth was continuing and some indicators including facilities and construction investment appeared to be improving.",
        "He also pointed out that uncertainties as to external conditions were high, due for instance to the possibility of a global economic slowdown as a result of the euro area sovereign debt crisis and to the concerns about a run-up in international oil prices.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister forecast that, although the rate of increase in consumer prices had fallen somewhat month-on-month in January, factors such as international oil price hikes resulting from the sanctions on Iran, international financial market unrest caused by concerns about the euro area sovereign debt crisis spreading, and so on would work to destabilize prices in the future.",
        "Concerning the trends of external transactions, the 1st Vice Minister judged January’s first year-on-year export decline in 27 months, since October 2009, as attributable to one-off seasonal factors such as the base-period effect from the concentration of ship exports in January 2011, and to the decrease in number of days worked due to the Lunar New Year holidays having fallen in January rather than in February.",
        "He on the other hand estimated that the current account would post a deficit as a whole for January, due mostly to a deficit in the trade account and a deficit in the services account resulting from increased overseas travel during winter vacation etc.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in view of the possibility of domestic economic growth slowdown amid the uncertainties as to the price situation and economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "One member expressed the view that, in a situation in which it was not easy to change interest rate policy, the Committee should clarify the central bank’s will to stabilize prices, given the increase in public utility charges, the run-up in international oil prices, and the sustained high level of expected inflation.",
        "Another member pointed out that efforts were required to stabilize consumer prices through the government’s micro inflation policy, given that even though guard against prices should not be lowered, there was limited scope for the operation of interest policy due to signs of economic slowdown.",
        "He also asserted that, to engineer a soft-landing of the household debt problem, the costs and benefits of various policy measures including a Base Rate hike must be reexamined, and ways for mitigating their side effects sought.",
        "One other member remarked that a rate hike might accelerate the economic slowdown, entailing risks of an expansion in the amplitude of economic fluctuations, even though the current level of the Base Rate and the consequent negative real interest rate conditions remained accommodative.",

        "subdued overall and exports also decreasing.",
        "On the employment front, however, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Members covered the following areas: Many members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its moderate recovery, but the political uncertainties in the euro area, concerns about the Spanish economy, and so on to be further amplifying the downside risks to its growth path.",
        "One among these members expressed the view that the ample global liquidity supplied through major central banks’ quantitative easing could stoke inflationary pressures in the future.",
        "In regard to the current state of the domestic economy, members commented that its recovery appeared to be faltering somewhat, with some real economy indicators for March coming out lower than expected.",
        "One of these members deemed the recent economic growth to have been led by the government sector through increased fiscal front-loading, and the momentum of recovery in private domestic demand such as consumption and investment to remain weak.",
        "As to the outlook, most members judged that, unless economic conditions at home and abroad worsened dramatically, the domestic economy would show a modest recovery while remaining on the growth path predicted in April.",
        "One member mentioned, however, that given the government’s reduced fiscal space and the uncertainties as to external conditions, there was a need to keep a closer watch on the future pace of economic recovery.",
        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members assessed English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "that, although foreign portfolio investment funds had shifted to a net outflow, owing largely to the heightened international financial market unrest, major price variables such as stock prices and exchange rates exhibited relatively stable movements, boosted for the most part by strong economic fundamentals and adequate foreign currency liquidity.",
        "One member, however, argued that attention should be paid to the possibility of foreign capital in- and outflows surging due chiefly to European financial institution deleveraging.",
        "Regarding consumer prices, members pointed out that the uptrend in prices appeared to be cooling, with consumer price inflation having come in at the mid-2% level for two consecutive months, but that constant attention to underlying inflationary pressures was called for, given the existence of destabilizing factors such as the high level of expected inflation and the possibility of hikes in public utility charges and nominal wages.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and then left the room before the Base Rate was discussed: The 1[st] Vice Minister assessed that, although the trend of improvement in employment continued, external uncertainties were running high, caused largely by the instability of international oil prices and the possibility of economic recession in the eurozone, at a time when real indicator improvements were showing signs of faltering.",
        "He pointed out that prices were showing stable movements as in the previous month, but that upward pressures for example from hikes in public utility fees and in processed food prices remained.",
        "He went on to remark that, while exports had been smooth in April, centering around major items such as automobiles and steel, exports as a whole had posted negative year-on-year growth, owing mostly to a base effect and to the decrease in number of days worked due to the general election, but then forecast that the current account would sustain its surplus as it had in March.",
        "The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that the domestic economic recovery was forecast to be sustained going forward, but that it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, considering that inflationary pressures remained and that uncertainty had mounted somewhat due to recent changes in conditions at home and abroad.",
        "One of these members commented that it would be preferable to keep the interest rate normalization stance maintained since July 2010 intact for the time being, in order to firmly anchor the foundation for price stability and prepare against downside risks to the economy going forward.",
        "One member meanwhile expressed the view that there was a need to further strengthen monitoring of such factors causing domestic financial market unrest as the recent additional suspensions of mutual savings banks, the household debt problem and the potential for an expansion in foreign currency fund flows, and to constantly check the possibilities of their metastasizing into financial systemic risk.",
        "In this connection, one other member put forward the opinion that it was necessary to review whether there was a possibility of individual business loans and group loans causing financial market unrest.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: In regard to the global economy, members’ appraisal was that, although market anxieties had eased somewhat owing to the policy responses of major central banks, the global economy’s sluggishness had continued and its downside risks had increased further—due to the persistent economic downturns in major advanced countries and consequent slowdowns of growth in emerging market countries.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that the downside risks to growth had increased and the growth momentum was continuing to weaken, with private sector dynamism ebbing on the worsening of consumer and investor sentiments.",
        "As to the outlook, most members anticipated that growth would run below initial forecasts, since it seemed difficult for exports to rebound any time soon with the pace of domestic demand recovery being feeble.",
        "One of these members remarked that it might take some time for the economy to return to its long-term trend level.",
        "Members assessed the domestic financial markets to be showing an overall pattern of stability as stock prices had risen and the exchange rate had fluctuated within a narrow range on the back of the improved domestic and overseas environment including, for instance, the upgrade of Korea’s sovereign rating.",

        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "Members noted that the inflation rate has continued to run below that it would remain at a low level for a considerable time.",
        "Members, however, also shared the view that attention should be paid to the possibility that price rise expectations and run-ups in commodity prices could act as risk factors.",
        "Meanwhile, one member mentioned with regard to real estate prices that, while their downtrend in Seoul and its surrounding areas persisted, those in the rest of the country appeared to have topped out with their uptrend coming to a halt.",
        "After the members’ discussions, the 1[st] Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative, made the following comments and then left the room before the Base Rate decision: Prices were exhibiting stability and domestic demand indicators had temporarily improved somewhat, but the sluggishness in mining and manufacturing production was becoming more pronounced due mainly to the slowdown in exports.",
        "In the job market, employment growth had slowed somewhat in August, but this was interpreted as reflecting a reversion to the norm.",
        "Exports had posted negative growth in August, as in the previous month, affected chiefly by sharp decreases in those of major items including ships, automobiles and steel, and by the vacation season.",
        "However, the underlying surplus in the current account was forecast to be sustained.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Although the sluggishness in domestic demand and exports were expected to last while inflation continued to run at a low level, members decided unanimously to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, sharing the view that there was a need to keep an eye on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad for a while longer, since domestic and overseas financial market instability had eased somewhat of late and major countries were taking policy measures to boost their economies.",
        "One of these members pointed out that, should the Base Rate be lowered that month, the consequent macroeconomic opportunity costs could be very large, given the economic environments at home and abroad, the need for pursuit of restructuring, the limited effect of a Base Rate cut and the benefit of securing policy space, etc.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, the central bank should make efforts to develop microeconomic policy instruments in the medium and long term to raise the economy’s below-potential growth rate, including measures to induce stronger competitiveness and strengthen macro-leverage management, and also the central bank should ease external shocks transmitted through the financial markets by fine-tuning of macro-prudential tools and close monitoring of foreign capital in- and out-flows, etc.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: In regard to the global economy, members assessed its sluggishness to be continuing and its downside risks to have increased further, due to the economic contractions in major advanced countries and the slowdowns of growth in emerging market countries resulting from the high degree of uncertainty.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members pointed out that its growth momentum appeared to be weakening, as the recovery of the domestic demand sector including private consumption and facilities investment was slowing while exports were showing lackluster performances as a result of the sluggishness in major economies.",
        "As to the outlook, many members anticipated that, the growth path was highly likely to run below its long-term trend for a considerable time considering the uncertainties in the external sector and the weak recovery in the domestic demand sector.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that foreign portfolio investment funds had shifted to a net inflow, due mostly to the ample global liquidity, the expectations of further Base Rate cuts and the increased preference for safe assets, and that this had caused market interest rates to drop sharply, thereby leading to manifestations of a more inverted yield curve and of a concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market.",
        "English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "In relation to consumer prices, members forecast that they would remain on a stable track for the time being, as consumer price inflation had exhibited a low rate of 1.5% in July on the back of the stabilization of agricultural and petroleum product prices, and that upward pressures on both the supply and demand sides had eased, largely in response to the economic sluggishness and to lower international commodity prices.",
        "Some members, however, took the view that potentially destabilizing factors making for price rises were still present, considering the high level of inflation expectations, hikes in public utility charges and the possibility of a rise in international grain prices, coupled with the fact the current low price trends were largely based on a base-period effect and institutional factors such as the free childcare support.",
        "Meanwhile, some members anticipated that the housing market slump would persist for some time longer going forward, as the margin of decline in real estate prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas was widening and prices in the rest of the country were edging up at a slower pace.",

        "Although exports had recorded negative growth in July, owing mostly to the decrease in global demand and to the base effect, the current account would sustain its surplus as it had in June.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, since for the time being there was a need to assess carefully the effects of the recent rate cut and to monitor the trends of real economic indicators at home and abroad closely, although the recovery of economic growth was very slow and CPI had shown a stable trend.",
        "Furthermore, one member expressed the opinion that, in a situation in which the scope for conduct of policy was fairly constrained, the policy capacity should be focused now on relieving the weakening sentiment of economic agents through an active communication strategy, since it would not be easy to undertake bold policy adjustments if the downside risks to growth materialized going forward.",
        "Another member argued that the direction of fiscal policy should be considered when making policy decisions in the coming months, since greater effects could be expected when the interest rate policy was implemented in harmony with other levers of fiscal and macroeconomic policy tools.",
        "Meanwhile, one other member asserted that, although the possibility of debt deflation occurring as suggested recently in some circles was evaluated as not high, the household debt- and real estate-related issues—factors to which the Korean economy was structurally vulnerable— posed the risk of escalation to ignite a crisis at any time, and so measures to resolve them must be sought with continued interest in the future.",

        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy had shown strong growth, the euro area had maintained its gradual improvement, and the Chinese economy had sustained its stable growth.",
        "Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, with Treasury bond yields exhibiting slower growth and stock prices rising, particularly in advanced countries, as the anxiety that had followed the US presidential election and US Fed’s rate hike eased.",
        "However, members assessed that the Chinese yuan and some EME currencies had weakened significantly and remained highly volatile.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that domestic demand had shown weaker improvement due to the sluggishness of facilities investment and manufacturing production, which had more than offset the recovery in exports.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members mentioned that long-term market interest rates had fallen and stock prices had risen with the stabilization of the international financial markets, but the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had remained highly volatile and bank household lending had declined.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to a level of around 1½ percent in the fourth quarter with international oil and agricultural product prices increasing, and that core inflation had stood at a little above the 1½ percent level.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, with regard to the domestic real economy, the member stated that, although economic sentiment had withered due to the heightened uncertainties at home and abroad, domestic demand had sustained gradual growth and exports had shown improvement, but uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had increased even further.",
        "Second, the member stated that consumer price inflation had accelerated in the fourth quarter of last year, boosted largely by hikes in oil and agricultural product prices, while core inflation had slowed due mainly to a slower pace of growth in industrial product prices.",
        "The member also noted that consumer price inflation was expected to accelerate, and inflation pressures were forecast to weaken somewhat toward the end of the year with the lapse of supply-side factors.",
        "Third, the member argued that substantial slack in the manufacturing sector had improved somewhat, as demand-side pressures from facilities investment had rebounded and the average capacity utilization ratio had risen with the sluggishness in the manufacturing sector easing somewhat, but that improvement in the slack in the labor force had continued to slow with the time gap, including the time-related underemployed, increasing slightly.",
        "In terms of financial conditions, the member stated that, as surges in market interest rates after the US presidential election had eased, the spread between long- and short-term yields and corporate bond credit spreads had narrowed somewhat, foreign equity investment had shifted to a net inflow and outflows of bond investment had stabilized, but the potential instability of securities fund flows had heightened due to the narrowing of the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates.",
        "With regard to household credit, the member noted that non-bank lending had maintained strong growth and therefore a careful watch should be kept on the effects of stronger prudential regulations on the non-banking sector.",
        "Concerning corporate credit, meanwhile, the downturn phase of the corporate credit cycle had continued owing to the sharp decreases at both large corporations and SMEs and to sustained net corporate bond redemptions.",
        "Based on these considerations, the member stated that it should be borne in mind that, although there seemed to be a need for additional monetary easing in macroeconomic terms, domestic and external uncertainties and financial stability risks had also increased further, and at this point in time keeping the Base Rate at its current level was considered to have larger benefits than adjusting it, in consideration of the following points.",
        "First, a substantial part of the negative output gap had been attributable to a shortage of external demand and was therefore difficult to address through Base Rate adjustments, and the global manufacturing sector and the terms of trade were showing signs of recovery and their future trends needed to be monitored.",
        "In addition, the member emphasized that global reflationary pressures had been transmitted to the domestic economy and also that consumer price inflation was very likely to near its target this year.",
        "In addition, the member noted that, with the Base Rate below the neutral interest rate, the tightening of financial conditions following a rise in long-term interest rates was not yet at a concerning level, and that long-term interest rates, having been lowered excessively due chiefly to the effects of advanced countries’ quantitative easing, had been normalized to some extent, which would have the positive effects of curbing the exposure of the financial system to real estate risks and the risk of further debt leveraging.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period and retain policy space, while closely examining how developments of domestic and external risk factors would affect the future growth and price paths.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member mentioned that, in the current circumstances, the growth rate was forecast to reach a level of around 2½ percent and consumer price inflation to near its target of 2 percent this year, but continued attention needed to be paid to how the Korean economy would be affected by changes in the real and financial markets following US rate hikes.",
        "The member assessed the US rate hikes begun two years ago as having strengthened the synchronization of medium-term interest rates between Korea and the US and caused the intersection of the yield curves to move toward the short-term one, and as a result, foreign investment funds had been redeemed, adding to capital outflows.",
        "With these points taken into consideration, the member expected that, in the case of US rate hikes led by US economic improvement, the US yield curve would move upward and the Korean yield curve would steepen up to the point of medium-term rates, contributing to some easing of the inefficient distribution of funds that had threatened financial stability.",
        "The member also pointed out that if a recovery of exports works to improve the real economy, this would cause the neutral interest rate to rise, which would not bring about significant changes under the current monetary easing policy.",
        "The member also took the view that, while exports were picking up in accordance with the global economic recovery, it would be necessary to promote structural reform rapidly and rearrange medium- and long-term strategies to create an environment in which households can shift from leveraged spending to income-based spending, and also to continue to prepare for population ageing through overseas investment.",
        "The member assessed current global downside risks as somewhat large and mentioned that if these risks materialize, policies should be determined in consideration of the channels through which the risks would be transmitted to the Korean economy and also of what shape they would take.",
        "The member went on to stress that, amid global economic uncertainties and the need to pay attention to stability in the Korean financial markets, Korea’s monetary policy should focus on achieving the inflation target, the nominal anchor for the Korean economy.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on downside risks to the macroeconomy.",
        "The member noted that the world economy was sustaining its moderate recovery, and there had recently been signs of reflation.",
        "The member went on to comment that, accordingly, exports were shifting to an increase with export prices in Korea increasing, and consumer price inflation was gradually accelerating.",
        "The member also noted that the steep rises in market interest rates had eased, and foreign exchange supply and demand conditions remained stable.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member assessed that some positive movements had been observed.",
        "For instance, with the capacity utilization ratio recovering, particularly in the automobile industry, manufacturing production showed a relatively substantial rebound in November, and demand for semiconductors increased.",
        "The member, however, stated the need for paying further attention to downside risks to the macroeconomy overall.",
        "The member commented that, in contrast to the rebound in the manufacturing industry, the pace of growth in services production had slowed.",
        "The member also expected growth in the construction sector to slow, as the real estate market was stabilizing and the rapid increases in the housing supply would end this year.",
        "The member anticipated that a tangible recovery of the overall growth of the Korean economy was unlikely, despite a partial rebound in exports.",
        "The member then noted that, with such conditions making it difficult to be optimistic about the overall economy, underlying inflation was unlikely to converge toward the 2% target.",
        "Concerning household debt, the member expected it to continue to increase substantially in 2017 as well, given the already signed collective loans and the low interest rate environment.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that, if the real estate market remained stable, the pace of increase in household debt was likely to slow gradually.",
        "Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member judged it desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the month, and to keep a close watch on economic developments and overall Korean macroeconomic trends, such as changes in household debt growth and the pace of the housing market slowdown.",
        "The member also presented the view that it was also desirable to maintain channels of communication with the fiscal authorities to prevent fiscal policy from tightening, while continuing cooperation with the financial authorities to ease the rapid increase in household debt.",
        "One member, meanwhile, took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "With respect to the real economy, the member noted that, as for production indicators, the index of all industry production had risen after declining for two consecutive months, and the drastic decline in the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector had stopped, while as for demand indicators, construction work value had shifted to an increase.",
        "The member noted that exports, in particular, had continued to grow in December after beginning to increase in November, and this was mainly attributable to industrial factors, such as a recovery of world semiconductor market demand.",
        "The member positively evaluated this point, saying that exports had become more likely to maintain their upward trend going forward.",
        "In terms of prices, the member forecast that consumer price inflation would converge closely to the 2% target level around the third quarter, influenced by a rebound in oil prices.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need to pay attention to whether inflation would remain at the target level after the second half of this year, when the base-period effect from oil price declines would disappear.",
        "Concerning financial stability, the member noted that household debt had showed signs of stabilization for the first time, with bank household lending growth decreasing considerably in December.",
        "The member viewed household debt as likely to stabilize this year, considering that household debt growth was largely linked with the growth of housing prices.",
        "The member, meanwhile, stated that, although concerns had been raised about capital outflows and the worsening of Korea’s external soundness due to an inversion of Treasury bond yields in Korea and the US since the second half of 2016, the possibility that the inversion would trigger financial instability was low, given that there were no signs of abnormal capital flows going beyond normal market mechanisms.",
        "The member commented that, in overall consideration of the aforementioned assessments, the negative inflation and GDP gaps had both widened somewhat, which suggested that circumstances might call for a more accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that it was desirable to make the Base Rate decision in a more cautious manner, for three reasons.",
        "First, if the US economic recovery leads to sustained increases in the US policy rate and market interest rates, monetary policy easing in Korea could expand automatically.",
        "Second, uncertainties surrounding the estimation of the GDP gap in Korea have been higher than ever.",
        "Third, although household debt is expected to stabilize, it is necessary to check actual household debt developments.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member forecast that, although growth in private consumption and construction investment would slow, the Korean economy would maintain its modest growth thanks to improvements in exports and facilities investment.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that the Bank of Korea should closely monitor and respond to the possible materialization of downside risk factors, such as growing household debt burdens, a contraction in economic sentiment stemming from political uncertainties, and a weakening of global trade growth following strengthened trade protectionism.",
        "The member also assessed that the Korean economy should speed up its restructuring efforts, support economic recovery with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, and cope with several risk factors at the same time.",
        "The member went on to stress that, in order for these efforts to succeed, it was very important to support job creation through economic stimulus.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to household debt, the member noted that effects were expected from several government measures.",
        "The member then went on to express the opinion that the Bank of Korea, together with the government, should continuously and closely monitor household debt and real estate market conditions.",
        "The member also took the opinion that, although the international financial markets had been relatively stable, vigilance needed to be maintained concerning market developments in emerging market economies and capital flow conditions in Korea going forward.",
        "The member noted that it was necessary to make active efforts to maintain Korea’s international credit standing, which set Korea apart from other emerging market economies.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts in particular.",
        "In making such judgment, the member gave important consideration to macroeconomic and financial conditions, as follows.",
        "First, with respect to economic conditions, although economic growth seemed to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2016, the pace of growth was still consistent with the Bank of Korea’s October 2016 outlook.",
        "Concerning the growth outlook for 2017, there was great uncertainty as to how the actual trend of growth would play out due to various potential domestic and overseas upside and downside risks, and stated that a gradually higher trend of growth was expected in the second half of 2017 thanks primarily to improved exports, led by the global economic recovery.",
        "Next, looking at price conditions, consumer price inflation had increased to the mid- to upper-1% level in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was expected to converge closely to the 2% inflation target going forward.",
        "Consumer price inflation as presented in the January economic outlook stood at 1.8%, and upside and downside risks to the future inflation path were assessed to be neutral in view of conditions at home and abroad.",
        "In the financial markets, price volatility had fallen and the volume of foreign bond investment outflows had decreased with international financial markets becoming stable.",
        "The USD/KRW rate, however, had showed wide fluctuation in January, influenced for instance by changes in expectations related to US monetary policy.",
        "5-year Treasury bond yields in Korea and the US had been inverted since mid-December 2016, following 10-year Treasury bond yields.",
        "Since there were several potential risk factors in the domestic and overseas financial markets related to the direction of the new US administration’s economic policy, the pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization, the movements of the Chinese yuan’s exchange rate, and domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member thought that the volatilities of price variables and capital flows could increase again going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, although bank household lending had grown at a slower pace of late, the member found it difficult at this juncture to judge whether this represented a trend, since it was also affected by one-off factors.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of global economic recovery has expanded somewhat, led by the US and some emerging market economies.",
        "Global financial market volatility has diminished, as the trends of rising government bond rates in major countries have subsided and stock prices have risen.",
        "Looking ahead the Board judges that the global economic recovery will be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.",
        "- In Korea, the slump in exports has eased but the Board judges the pace of domestic economic growth to have slowed somewhat, as the recovery in domestic demand activities has weakened.",
        "Employment conditions have been somewhat sluggish, with the number of persons employed having continued to decline in the manufacturing sector while its trend of increase in the service sector has slowed as well.",
        "The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year in the mid-2% range.",
        "The trend of recovery in domestic demand activities is expected to be limited, due to deteriorations in economic sentiment for example, but exports will likely improve thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, in line with the easing of downward price pressures on the supply side.",
        "Core inflation (excluding food & energy product prices from the CPI) has been in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise to near the 2% target level by around the middle of and that core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have subsided somewhat as the global financial market has stabilized.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has continued its uptrend seen since October of last year, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar globally.",
        "The upward trends of housing sales prices have slowed, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "Household lending has continued its substantial increase, but the amount of increase in that by banks has shown signs of lessening recently.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high, given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for the Second Half of discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, along with improvements in world trade, the recovery of the global economy had been sustained, centering around advanced economies.",
        "Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, despite changes in expectations of major countries’ monetary policy stances and geopolitical risks.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the Korean economy had been showing a recovery, with exports and investment remaining buoyant and consumer expectations indicators improving, while private consumption had not yet exhibited substantial improvement.",
        "With regard to prices, meanwhile, members noted that consumer price inflation had been nearing its target of 2 percent, while core inflation had fallen below the target.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that household debt had maintained strong growth and attention should be paid to the possibility of consequent financial instability and constraints on monetary policy.",
        "Members also stressed the need to closely monitor the trend of household debt in line with related government measures in the coming months.",
        "Trends' are posted on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent this month.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had been showing recovery along with improvements in international trade, and that with consumer price inflation gradually nearing its target, major advanced countries were hinting that they could shift away from monetary easing policies as the US had.",
        "The member expressed the view that the prolonged monetary policy easing stances had been a result of the delayed achievement of inflation targets due to the weakening linkage between real economies and inflation since the global financial crisis, and that this had in turn been attributable to global structural factors.",
        "Furthermore, considering these structural changes, the member mentioned that the increasing side effects of monetary easing, as well as the inflation gap, should be taken into consideration in assessing the future monetary policy stance.",
        "In this regard, the member pointed to surging debt undermining the consumption expansion and the overheating of the stock and housing markets due to low costs of capital relative to medium-term natural interest rates.",
        "As to the Korean economy, the member noted that, although exports had been improving along with global economic recovery, they were not yet having clear trickle-down effects on consumption, and that this seemed to have been attributable to the high rate of savings resulting from the population structure, a reduced consumption base due to income imbalances, and decreased capacity for consumption in line with growing household debt.",
        "The member went on to argue that the recent buoyancy of construction and IT-related facilities investment had not led to a fundamental turnaround in household consumption.",
        "The member also mentioned that, despite the sustained accommodative monetary policy stance, core inflation had remained below 2 percent in Korea, similar to that of other OECD countries, suggesting that domestic consumer price inflation had been largely driven by global structural effects, and that consumer price inflation had been also nearing 2 percent, owing to external one-off factors such as oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that capital allocation had been concentrated in profit-seeking through leverage, raising concerns about financial instability, and that household consumption had been affected more by debt-servicing burdens than by the easing of liquidity restrictions, adding to the negative side effects of the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned matters, the member argued that it seemed to be time to review the current monetary easing policies, but due to uncertainties about the recovery of the domestic economy, about whether core inflation had been approaching its medium-term target, and about the effects of the government’s recent real estate policy, any decision to change the monetary policy stance should be made in consideration of trade-offs between the pace of growth in household debt and the consumption-led recovery.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, and pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the domestic real economy had continued to improve, with growth led by exports and investment in the second quarter as well.",
        "However, with the recovery in private consumption remaining sluggish, facilities and construction investment, having recently exhibited strong growth, seemed to have entered a correction phase, and manufacturing and services production had weakened somewhat.",
        "Boosted by favorable performances during the first quarter, the growth path had moved upward, raising the annual growth forecast, but growth momentum was likely to weaken somewhat in the second half, affected chiefly by weakening export growth and corrections in construction and facilities investment.",
        "However, the growth rate was likely to remain similar to its potential level in the second half as well.",
        "Second, looking at inflation, consumer price inflation was expected to rise at a somewhat slower pace in the second half, owing chiefly to the stabilization of agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices and the weakening base-period effects of oil prices, but would likely approach near its target level later on.",
        "Core inflation, on the other hand, had continued to fall short of the 2-percent level, due mainly to the lack of demand-side pressures, and these pressures were unlikely to increase substantially for the time being, considering that the narrowing of the negative output gap was attributable to the declining potential growth rate rather than to sufficiently strong aggregate demand.",
        "Third, the improving trends in production sector slack had shown signs of faltering, with the sales to inventory ratio rising and the average capacity utilization ratio declining in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The slack in the labor force, meanwhile, had increased for the third consecutive month in June, with growth in the unemployment and time gaps more than offsetting the lack of substantial changes in the participation gap.",
        "Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, with upward pressures on long-term market rates growing due to risk aversion in reaction to the changing global monetary policy stances, the spread between long- and short-term yields had widened, while credit spreads had narrowed slightly, led by a recovery in investor sentiment following improvements in corporate performances.",
        "In the credit market, meanwhile, household lending had maintained strong growth owing mainly to increased housing transaction volume and demand prior to the implementation of real estate measures, while lending to SMEs had exhibited slow growth despite the economic recovery.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member presented the opinion that, while keeping the Base Rate unchanged at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should see if the recent export-driven economic recovery spreads to the domestic demand sector.",
        "The member noted that exports and manufacturing facilities investment in the Korean economy had expanded in line with continued economic recovery in advanced economies.",
        "The member commented, however, that the real sector had shown no marked change with core inflation indicators remaining at the mid-1% range, running below consumer price inflation.",
        "The member also observed that household debt was still continuing to grow at a worrisome level.",
        "The member stated that the most notable aspect of the past two to three months was the surge in consumer expectations, which existing analysis results implied would lead to higher private consumption for the corresponding and following quarters.",
        "However, the member assessed that the relevant indices had not been showing any marked trend of recovery in actual private consumption.",
        "In addition, the member pointed out that the sharp increase in consumer sentiment had appeared with the launch of the new government, which has been placing emphasis on household income, and thus consumer expectations may be significantly influenced by the actual implementation of the government policy.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that manufactoring and service production-related indicators in the second quarter seemed to have been somewhat insufficient to be confident that the trend of economic recovery in the previous quarter was continuing.",
        "The member particularly noted that typical domestic demand areas, such as the wholesale & retail trade and food & accommodation industries, were continuing to show sluggishness since the second half of last year.",
        "Taking these factors into overall consideration, the member judged it difficult to say that the expansion in exports seen since the second half of last year was having spillover effects on domestic demand, and also expressed a lack of confidence that the Korean economy was continuing to show the rapid pace of recovery needed for underlying inflation to accelerate to the 2% target level.",
        "The member, thus, presented the view that, while maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance, it was desirable to assess if the economy would see a sustained recovery at a pace sufficient to boost inflation.",
        "In addition, concerning the trend of sharply increasing household debt, the member added that it was necessary to actively cooperate with the relevant policy authorities by strengthening public policy regulations and macroprudential policies to prevent markets from underestimating the household debt risk.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while keeping a close watch on whether improvements in consumer sentiment would lead to a recovery in private consumption, whether household debt would stabilize, and the trend of the price path.",
        "The member noted that the rate of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth stood at 1.1% in the first quarter of this year due to large increases in exports and facilities investment, and that a possibility of a recovery in household consumption had emerged thanks to improvements in consumer sentiment.",
        "The member noted that, as a result, expectations had emerged that this year’s economic growth rate could be adjusted upward from the previous forecast.",
        "The member stated that, with strong exports and facilities investment driving growth in the second quarter, exports had increased on the back of a boom in the semiconductor market, and global trade volume had been showing improvement, but consumption had continued to mark time, despite improvements in sentiment indices.",
        "The member noted that the 2.8% growth forecast released by the Bank of Korea Research Department in July seemed to be neutral with similar upside and downside risks, given that the recovery from stagnation in consumption was still insufficient.",
        "The member went on to assess that this improvement in the economic outlook showed that the Korean economy was returning to a balanced growth path.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the price path had not been showing a commensurate change.",
        "The member noted that, while consumer prices had not differed greatly from their original projection, core inflation had actually slowed to the mid-1% range in the second quarter.",
        "The member then offered three hypotheses why the price path had been insensitive to the real economic trend.",
        "First, the formation of inflation expectations of economic agents may be adaptive, relying upon past inflation figures and failing to reflect the future economic outlook.",
        "Second, the mid- to long-term economic outlook of economic agents, which reflects their inflation expectations, may still not be bright.",
        "Third, the global low inflation environment may be influencing the price path in Korea as well.",
        "The member then noted that the second hypothesis seemed to better fit the recent Korean economy, and in this case, the appropriate monetary policy operation would be to check if the recent recovery in consumer sentiment leads to an actual recovery in consumption and take actions in response accordingly.",
        "The member, meanwhile, cited household debt as the biggest risk factor when keeping the Base Rate unchanged at the current level.",
        "The member noted that, although there was little likelihood of a household debt overhang escalating into a crisis in the financial sector, the consequent macro risk was not small.",
        "The member also raised concerns about a growing possibility that spillover effects from negative shocks, such as an economic recession or housing price declines, could expand due to heightened vulnerabilities to household income and housing price risks.",
        "The member also commented that the current interest rate decision was based on the premise that household debt growth will gradually show downward stability throughout this year and next year, owing for example to policy measures to stabilize the housing market and ensure financial soundness.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed that, with trends of recovery in the world economy and trade volume continuing, on the domestic economic front, private consumption had improved moderately from its sluggishness, and exports and investment had also remained buoyant.",
        "The member then noted that, considering these domestic and overseas factors, the Bank of Korea had adjusted the economic growth outlook for this year upward, and went on to state that, if policy effects from the government’s execution of the supplementary budget are considered, additional upward adjustments might be made.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that since there were several downside risks as well, such as China’s trade restrictions related to Korea’s THAAD deployment, stronger trade protectionism, and geopolitical risk related to North Korea, it was necessary to constantly examine the relevant developments.",
        "The member noted that GDP for this year and next year was expected to grow at the level of the potential growth rate, and consumer price inflation was forecast to increase to near the inflation target.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that, considering the downside risks to inflation, such as the weakening of the global reflation trend, it was necessary to wait and see further whether economic growth would show trends consistent with its forecast, while maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance at this point in time.",
        "The member, meanwhile, pointed out the need to keep a close watch on the possibility that financial stability issues could constrain monetary policy, through close analyses of domestic and overseas financial markets going forward.",
        "The member stressed that, although overall financial market conditions remained stable, factors making for instability, such as policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, changes in its reinvestment policy, and geopolitical risks related to North Korea, persisted.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to continuously monitor trends of foreign portfolio investment as well.",
        "The member noted that, concerning household debt, its growth was expected to slow in the second half, due for instance to the implementation of the related government measures and increases in market interest rates, but it was necessary to keep a close watch on the relevant developments.",
        "The member also emphasized that, while higher market rates may rein in the increase in household debt, they could also work to increase the household debt burdens of vulnerable groups.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, although their volatility has risen somewhat due to fluctuations in international oil prices and to changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the direction of international oil prices.",
        "- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports and investment have improved although the pace of increase in consumption has remained weak.",
        "On the employment front, the trend of year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed has slowed, and the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate have risen.",
        "The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of recovery going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year higher than the April projection (2.6%).",
        "Exports will sustain their trend of improvement, thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately, owing to improved economic agents’ sentiments.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole show the level (1.9%) projected in April.",
        "Core inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, price variable volatility has expanded somewhat, with the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate having risen considerably, in line with changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries and with increases in geopolitical risks, and long-term market interest rates having increased in concert with government bond rates in major countries.",
        "Stock prices have continued to climb, on the effects for example of the trend of solid domestic economic growth and expectations of improved performances at major companies.",
        "Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years’ levels, although the amount of year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat.",
        "In the housing market, the trends of rising sales and leasehold deposit prices have expanded, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the directions of the government's economic policies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, boosted largely by the robust growth of the US economy and favorable global manufacturing production, AEs had shown faster growth and EMEs had been recovering from their sluggishness.",
        "Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall since the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike in March.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, with the global economic recovery, exports and facilities investment had been buoyant, construction investment had been more favorable than expected, and domestic demand-oriented companies’ economic sentiment had been showing signs of recovery.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members mentioned that inflows of foreign portfolio investment had expanded, stock prices had risen and the won-dollar exchange rate had declined, but these movements had later reversed, affected chiefly by geopolitical risks.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had exceeded its target of 2 percent during the first quarter, influenced by strong growth in the prices of oil and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that the domestic real economy had continued to improve, with growth led by strong exports and facilities investment in line with the global economic recovery.",
        "The domestic economy was estimated to have grown faster than originally projected during the first quarter, as construction investment, previously forecast to undergo a correction, had shown more favorable movements than expected, and consumer sentiment and the sentiment of domestic demand-oriented companies, including those in the services sector, had been showing signs of recovery.",
        "As a result, the growth trend for the year was expected to move slightly upward from the path forecast in January.",
        "Second, inflation had accelerated, due mainly to supply-side factors, to exceed its target.",
        "Core inflation, however, had flattened and remained below 2 percent, while demand-side inflationary pressures, examined through core PCEPI and core inflation excluding regulated prices, had not fully strengthened yet.",
        "In light of this, despite the likelihood of consumer price inflation exceeding its target in the short term, there was only a limited possibility of this upward trend of inflation spreading to overall prices, and upward pressures were expected to weaken again toward the second half of the year, with the effects of supply-side factors diminishing gradually.",
        "Third, slack in the manufacturing sector was seen to have been improving, albeit slightly, with production growth continuing to outpace production capacity growth.",
        "The overall slack in the labor force had slightly improved in the labor market in March, with the unemployment and participation gaps narrowing while the time gap widened.",
        "Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, market interest rates and the spread between long- and short-term yields had been stable, while foreign portfolio investment inflows had increased.",
        "With regard to household credit, growth in bank lending had continued to slow and non-bank lending, after having maintained higher growth than usual, had been growing somewhat more slowly with the implementation of stronger credit management measures.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent to maintain the current monetary policy stance.",
        "The member mentioned that the recent recovery of global economic growth seemed to have been led by the accommodative fiscal policies of the US and some other major countries and also by the booming IT sector, and went on to state that expectations of economic recovery had been preemptively reflected in the financial markets, which had boosted consumer and investor sentiment, leading to expansions in production and exports.",
        "The member assessed that the Korean economy was highly dependent on the IT industry and thus was benefiting from the IT boom, and added that facilities investment had maintained IT investment-led growth since last year and construction investment had remained more favorable than originally forecast, and thanks to the derived effects of these trends, albeit slight, consumption seemed to have bottomed out somewhat.",
        "Taking these into overall consideration, the member forecast this year’s growth to exceed the previous projection, and took the view that, as price outlooks were unlikely to be changed much due to the GDP gap narrowing only slightly and as downside risks remained, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent during the intermeeting period and maintain the current monetary policy stance.",
        "In addition, the member stressed the need to consider the following three points in making monetary policy decisions.",
        "First, since the current trend of recovery in the Korean economy could not last long, it would be necessary to strengthen market-friendly macroprudential policies to ease the buildup of financial imbalances and improve financial stability.",
        "Second, considering that domestic and overseas investors were highly sensitive to the recently heightened geopolitical risks, there was a need to reexamine the stability of the financial system.",
        "Third, amid the recent positive external conditions, including the boom in the IT industry, it would be desirable to ensure macroeconomic policy space and promote medium-term growth, rather than adopting short-sighted approaches such as expanding investment and boosting consumption.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, concerning the global economy, advanced economies were showing expanded recovery, and emerging market economies were breaking out of their sluggishness.",
        "The member also assessed domestic economic activities to have shown improvement, as the sluggishness in private consumption had eased somewhat and exports and facilities investment had increased.",
        "The member commented that consumer price inflation had risen above the 2% inflation target, influenced by accelerating upward trends of oil prices and agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.",
        "The member also judged the domestic financial markets to have remained stable overall.",
        "The member noted that, in reflection of such improvements in economic activities, the economic growth rates for this year and next year had each been revised upward by concerns about greater downside risks, it was necessary to watch if the global economic recovery would continue as a trend.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expressed the opinion that, considering that consumer price inflation was anticipated to be below the 2% inflation target in annual terms, and that the domestic economy had thus far been growing at a modest pace, it was necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Next, the member commented that, although the trend of household debt growth had been slowing somewhat of late, the Bank of Korea should continue to monitor the household debt trend, while being aware of the relevant risks going forward, Concerning the possibility of capital outflows, the member noted that Korea had not been greatly affected, with the trend of capital inflows continuing since the US Fed’s March policy rate hike.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need to continue working actively to maintain Korea’s international credit standing, which set it apart from other emerging market economies, since geopolitical risks had been heightened of late.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged in April.",
        "The member noted that, in the real sector, a recovery in exports and the consequent large increase in facilities investment had led an overall rise in economic growth, and a slowdown in construction investment had been delayed, contrary to expectations.",
        "The member, however, commented that, although consumption had remained sluggish, the possibility seemed low that consumption would be worse than expected, as consumer sentiment indicators had been improving, due mainly to the easing of domestic political uncertainties, robust exports, and the improved profitability of domestic companies and the consequent rises in their stock prices.",
        "Accordingly, the member saw that the real economic trend in the first quarter was slightly above the January outlook released by the Bank of Korea.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that forecasts of future economic trends had become more uncertain due to geopolitical risks, such as Korea's deployment of THAAD and the North Korea nuclear issue.",
        "In terms of prices, the member noted that overall consumer price inflation was nearing its target of 2%, as a rebound in oil prices had led to a rebound in prices of industrial products, and one-off shock factors, such as avian influenza, had caused prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products to rise.",
        "The member, however, saw that the risk of the price path for this year significantly overshooting the existing path forecast was unlikely to be high, given that consumption remained sluggish and the trend of real economic growth in the first quarter was mainly attributable to strong exports and facilities investment.",
        "Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member commented that there had been two worrisome developments related to household debt, which had shown signs of stabilization this year.",
        "The member pointed out that, first, lending to households by non-bank financial institutions had been rising sharply, led by mutual credit firms, and second, optimism that the housing market would stabilize could be premature, since slower construction investment had not materialized, contrary to expectations.",
        "The member expressed the opinion in particular that in many cases a sharp increase in the supply of financial resources to a specific sector through an unorthodox financial sector was followed by insufficient credit risk management, and thus caution should be exercised to prevent unreasonable expectations about the revitalization of the housing market in the future, and the business and risk management statuses of mutual credit firms should be continually monitored for soundness.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, although some had raised concerns about instability in the foreign exchange and foreign capital markets due to an inversion of or narrowing gap between policy rates in Korea and the US, there had not been any sign of instability so far, and thus it was still possible to conduct monetary policy in reflection of the overall macroeconomic conditions in Korea.",
        "The member stated that, taking all those points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level in April, while, on the international front, keeping a close watch on the THAAD issue and other geopolitical risks and the developments related to their impacts on the Korean economy, and on the domestic front, monitoring the future household debt trend.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, attention should be paid to the extent that the gradually spreading global reflation trend would affect the Korean economy.",
        "The member evaluated that the reflation trend in the world economy was gradually spreading, as the international financial market and emerging market economies remained stable.",
        "The member also noted that, as Korea's exports rebounded with the recovery in world trade, production in the relevant manufacturing sectors had increased and facilities investment was recovering at a faster-than-expected pace.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that, although some consumer sentiment indicators had rebounded, a recovery could not easily be confirmed yet from the associated real economic indicators, particularly in the service industry, which reflects domestic demand conditions.",
        "Accordingly, the member pointed out that private consumption remained sluggish.",
        "The member, however, assessed that overall domestic demand, including investment, had not been slowing further, as facilities investment had expanded sharply and a correction in construction investment had not materialized yet.",
        "The member commented that these export and domestic demand conditions implied that short-term downside risks to the Korean macroeconomy had generally diminished.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that if the macroeconomic trend seen in recent months continued, the current negative GDP gap would narrow, thus lowering the possibility of an additional slowing of underlying inflation, which was still running below its target level.",
        "Therefore, the member presented the opinion that the Bank of Korea should maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance to ensure that underlying inflation reaches the target level, as a recovery in foreign demand would lead to improved domestic demand.",
        "The member also stated the view that it was necessary to seek a policy direction that would reduce the possibility of household debt and construction investment escalating into medium-term destabilizing factors in the macroeconomy.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.",
        "The member saw that the recovery in the world economy had been maintained, that the international financial markets remained stable overall after the US Fed's March rate hike, and that the trend of domestic economic growth had expanded further, led by exports and facilities investment.",
        "Looking at domestic economic conditions in more detail, the member first stated the opinion that the slight upward revisions to the Bank of Koreas’ economic growth forecasts for this year and next year were appropriate in consideration of the recent accelerating growth of exports and facilities investment and the improvement of economic sentiment, despite several downside risks to the future growth path.",
        "Second, the member commented that, looking at price conditions, with consumer price inflation rising above the inflation target in March, affected by increasing prices of petroleum products and prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products, it would likely fluctuate around the 2% level for the time being, but the member expected the year-on-year consumer price uptrend to slow somewhat from the fourth quarter on.",
        "Third, the member stated the need for further observation to judge if household debt growth would fundamentally slow, as non-banks' household lending was showing higher-than-usual growth and housing prices were also showing a rebound, although slower growth in banks' household lending had continued from the end of last year.",
        "Fourth, the member saw that, although the financial markets had remained stable overall, price variables and capital flow volatility could increase going forward, and particularly since a significant portion of foreign bond investment that had flowed in recently was aimed at short-term profit taking, such investment could flow out rapidly if market conditions were to change.",
        "The member also noted that the US Fed had implied a possible change in its reinvestment policy from the end of this year.",
        "The member thus called for attention to the possibility that such an implication could cause international financial markets to become highly unstable, just as when a Fed chair's implication that US quantitative easing would be tapered off caused the 2013 Taper Tantrum.",
        "The member stated that, looking at all these points comprehensively, there was no great need for a change to the existing policy stance of maintaining accommodative monetary policy to support the recovery of economic growth, while continuing to pay attention to risks to financial stability.",
        "The member then set out the view that it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level during the intermeeting period, while closely examining developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in the euro area.",
        "- The Board judges that the trend of domestic economic growth has expanded somewhat, as exports and investment have improved although consumption has remained low.",
        "The sluggishness in employment conditions has eased, with the extent of decline in the number of persons employed in the manufacturing sector having lessened and the trend of increase in persons employed in the service sector expanded.",
        "The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year slightly above the January projection (2.5%).",
        "Exports will sustain their trend of improvement, thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately as the deterioration in economic agents’ sentiment eases.",
        "However, the paces of improvement in exports and domestic demand activities are expected to be limited, owing to changes in conditions related to trade with major countries and to the weak improvement in households’ real purchasing power.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has fallen to the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at the 2% level, and for the year as a whole slightly exceed the January projection (1.8%).",
        "Core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have shown low levels, in reflection for example of stable movements in the global financial markets.",
        "After having fallen the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has rebounded, due mainly to a shift to US dollar strengthening and to geopolitical risks.",
        "The extent of growth in bank household lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in household lending by non-banks has been sustained.",
        "Housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas have risen slightly, and those in the rest of the country have held steady.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, geopolitical risks, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the global economic recovery had gained strength, with the growth momentum of the US economy recovering, and the trends of growth in the euro area, Japan and major emerging market economies all improving, boosted by global trade growth.",
        "Members also evaluated that international financial markets had remained stable, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, while private consumption still marked time, the pace of growth had expanded, led by exports and investment.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members mentioned that, despite North Korea-related geopolitical risks, inflows of foreign portfolio investment had continued, stock prices had risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had declined.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had reached its 2-percent target level in April and core inflation had fallen slightly to the mid-1-percent range.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25-percent level for the intermeeting period.",
        "First, the member anticipated that the economic growth rate would continue to be slightly above the April outlook.",
        "The member then presented the view that, although there were potential downside risks to growth, such as increased protectionism, monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and geopolitical risks, growth would likely be supported by continuing global economic recovery, improvement in economic sentiment, and the new administration’s expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Second, the member noted that consumer price inflation had remained at the 2-percent target in April as well, and this trend would likely continue for the time being.",
        "The member commented that, although core inflation had fallen slightly in April, it was unlikely to deviate greatly from 1.7-percent April projection for the year as a whole.",
        "Third, concerning financial conditions, the member noted that, although household lending in April had grown faster than most years, the pace of growth had decelerated compared to 2016.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that it was necessary to wait and see whether household lending growth would continue to slow, considering that the extent of the deceleration in household lending growth was not yet large, and that the stock of new apartments available for sale was expected to show solid growth.",
        "The member noted that, although the financial markets were showing stable movements overall, some had raised the concern that market participants’ perceptions of risks were excessively optimistic, and against this backdrop, a small shock could greatly heighten price variable volatility.",
        "Accordingly, the member pointed out the need to keep a careful watch on developments such as political uncertainties in the US, and risks related to North Korea’s nuclear tests.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted the need for close examination of the impacts of the new administration’s economic policy on the conditions for the conduct of monetary policy, such as macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.",
        "For instance, the member noted that an expansionary fiscal policy could work to reduce the need for the prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic recovery, and the government’s household debt measures could reduce financial stability risk, thus providing more room for the Bank of Korea to flexibly conduct its monetary policy in line with changes in macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Another member maintained the opinion presented at the previous meeting that, while keeping the Base Rate unchanged at its current keep a close eye on the extent to which the recent export recovery spreads to the Korean economy as a whole.",
        "The member noted that the trend of world economic recovery had been spreading since the second half of last year, and the gradual monetary policy normalization in the US was proceeding smoothly.",
        "Accordingly, the member saw that foreign demand and the relevant manufacturing production in the Korean economy were gradually increasing, led by semiconductors and petrochemical products.",
        "The member also noted that facilities investment was maintaining a faster-than-expected pace of recovery.",
        "In addition, the member judged that construction investment, which had increased rapidly for the past two years together with household debt, remained buoyant.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, if these recent economic movements continued, economic growth in Korea could exceed 2.6 percent, the forecast made in April by the Research Department of the Bank of Korea.",
        "However, the member noted that, since the recent positive changes in conditions had been led by some export industries, it was hard to say that spillover effects were spreading to the economy as a whole.",
        "The member pointed out that, while there had been a significant rebound in the consumer sentiment index, which had previously plunged from the fourth quarter of last year, consumption-related real indicators still remained weak, and such lackluster consumption demand had been acting as a constraint in reversing the trend of decline in underlying inflation, which had fallen to the mid-1% range for the past two years.",
        "Therefore, the member judged it desirable to maintain the current level of monetary policy accommodation to ensure that underlying inflation approaches the target level, as a recovery in foreign demand would be linked to consumption demand.",
        "The member noted that, in this process, it was necessary to keep a close watch on how the Korean macroeconomy would be affected in the future by the policy direction of the new administration, by any adjustment in the housing market, which is linked with household debt, and by changes in the intensity of China’s tourism restrictions on Korea.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that uncertainties regarding estimates of the GDP and inflation gaps had increased since the global financial crisis, and added that, in the case of the GDP gap, it seemed difficult to estimate it via the same method used in the past, due to fast-changing global demand, the long-term downward trend of exports and resulting slowdown in domestic demand, and the degree of preparation for population aging.",
        "The member also assessed that the link between inflation and the GDP gap seemed to have weakened, with economic rent to certain industries and businesses firmly entrenched due to the concentration of consumption expenditures on them and due to their consequent monopolies.",
        "The member argued that, as mentioned above, when these criteria are unclear, it is necessary to examine the results of recent policies before assessing their appropriateness.",
        "The member mentioned that the accommodative policy stance had been maintained to achieve the inflation target, in order to narrow the GDP gap and provide time for restructuring.",
        "The member noted that such monetary accommodation had propelled economic activities in the short term but had not led to a rise in core inflation, and financial imbalances had increased steadily.",
        "With regard to financial instability, the member noted that a substantial part of household debt had been held by those with higher credit ratings and higher incomes, and on average all income quintile groups had maintained positive net financial assets, and therefore this seemed unlikely to spread to systemic risk.",
        "However, the member went on to point out that housing market conditions should be taken into consideration since a substantial part of household debt was from housing construction, and the gap between the increased demand in the housing market through liabilities and the actual final demand would determine the degree of financial instability.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that, if the US Federal Reserve normalizes its interest rates with global demand picking up, this would boost exports, leading to upward adjustments of neutral interest rates, and if the spillover effects of exports are sufficient to increase consumption, responding with an interest rate hike could contain the buildup of financial instability without causing substantial changes to the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "However, the member went on to state that more careful considerations of exports’ spillover effects on domestic demand and of developments of financial instability were needed before adjusting the monetary policy stance, and expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged in May.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, in the real sector, exports had been stronger than expected with a boom in the global semiconductor industry, leading the strong growth in Korea’s facilities investment, particularly in the semiconductor industry.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that private consumption had remained stagnant despite strong exports and facilities investment and improvements in the consumer sentiment index, and added that whether consumption would recover would be the key to forecasting how far this year’s growth rate would exceed its April forecast of 2.6 percent.",
        "Next, with regard to inflation, the member noted that, although the real economy had been exceeding its forecast path, inflation had remained close to its original projection.",
        "The member went on to evaluate the price path for this year as thus far unlikely to greatly exceed its originally forecast path.",
        "However, the member mentioned that the need for a reexamination of the future path of consumer price inflation had grown significantly due to the sustained improvements in the real economy.",
        "In line with this, the member said that attention should be paid to whether and how much consumption, which had been stagnant, would recover, and to the global economic recovery and consequent developments of global price trends.",
        "Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member stated that, although having grown at a somewhat slower pace than in 2016, household debt maintained stronger growth than usual, and pointed out that there were concerns about the recent rapid growth of housing prices, particularly in Seoul and the surrounding area, and the substantial amount of stock of new apartments planned for sale.",
        "Going forward, the member noted that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility that expectations regarding the new government and improvements in economic sentiment could lead to instability in the housing market, while monitoring the future trends of household debt.",
        "Concerning FX swap and FX market stability, meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that overall market conditions had remained normal and stable, with capital flows and prices reflecting real economic conditions, while the sustained geopolitical risk and the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike stance had only limited effects on the flows of global investment funds into Korea and related price variables.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while keeping a close watch on whether the real economy would grow further and the trends of the price path and household debt.",
        "Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the domestic real economy had continued to show gradual improvement, boosted by sustained strong exports and facilities investment and better-than-expected housing market activities and construction investment, which together offset the sluggish recovery of private consumption.",
        "As corporate performances were improving and economic sentiment was picking up, the effects of strong exports on domestic demand, including private consumption and employment, were expected to take shape gradually, albeit in a limited manner.",
        "Second, with regard to prices, while personal service inflation had been on a gradual rise, growth in overall core inflation-related indexes had decelerated.",
        "This implied that, despite improvements in economic activities, demand-side inflationary pressures remained weak due to the limited spillover effects on inflation due to overall domestic demands, and accordingly a careful watch would be needed on future spillovers of prices and core inflation trends.",
        "Third, the slack in manufacturing production seemed to have improved, albeit gradually, with the average capacity utilization rate rebounding in line with the rate of growth in manufacturing production continuing to exceed the growth in its capacity.",
        "Meanwhile, the overall slack in the labor market worsened somewhat, as the unemployment and time gaps widened, which more than offset the narrowing of the participation gap in accordance with a year-on-year decrease in the number of potential job seekers.",
        "Fourth, with regard to financial stability conditions, short-term and long-term market rates and corporate bond spreads showed stable movements, while foreign portfolio investment inflows continued with the sustained risk appetite in the international financial markets.",
        "However, the member pointed out that it would be necessary to prepare for the risk of a shift from the low volatility regime of major asset prices to a higher volatility regime, as risk aversion sentiment against emerging market assets could strengthen again if market expectations of the Trump administration’s policies weaken and the US Fed begins to discuss in earnest plans to reduce its asset holdings.",
        "In addition, despite the government measures to strengthen supervision, household debt remained on a steep rise.",
        "Since construction activities were likely to remain favorable for the time being and the stock of new apartments available for sale was rising, it would be difficult to rule out the possibility of a continued increase in the household debt-to-income ratio.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level at this time.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the growth rate for this year was likely to exceed the April forecast of 2.6 percent, as the global economy and trade had continued to show recovery and, looking at the domestic economy, facilities and construction investment and exports had shown favorable movements.",
        "The member also mentioned that there existed upside risks, including expectations of the new government’s economic policy and a possibility that China would ease its trade restrictions.",
        "In addition, the member pointed out that consumer price inflation had risen by 1.9 percent year-on-year in April as well, remaining near its 2-percent target.",
        "However, the member argued that the current accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained, as more time seemed to be needed for private consumption to recover, the output gap remained negative, and consumer price inflation was unlikely to exceed its target for the time being.",
        "Furthermore, the member pointed out the need to bear in mind that downside risks could arise due to destabilizing factors, such as moves to strengthen trade protectionism and geopolitical risks, and the member also stated that there was a need to closely monitor and analyze the global economy.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although the domestic financial markets had remained stable overall and foreign bond and portfolio investment had continued to flow in, it would be necessary to constantly examine the effects of the US Fed’s rate hikes and geopolitical risks.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stressed that, while household debt growth seemed to have slowed gradually due chiefly to the government’s risk management efforts, the trends of housing markets, including the market for new apartments, should be closely monitored.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with for example the trend of rising stock prices continuing.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and political uncertainties in major countries.",
        "expanded, as exports and investment have improved although the pace of increase in consumption has remained weak.",
        "On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued to rise significantly year-on-year, although the unemployment rate has also risen as job search activities have increased.",
        "Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to be slightly above the path projected in April.",
        "The Board judges that consumption will likely continue its modest trend of growth, but that the trends of improvement in exports and investment should expand compared to the April forecasts.",
        "mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen slightly to the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole not diverge greatly from the April projection (1.9%).",
        "Core inflation appears likely to show a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "with stock prices rising and the volatility of long-term market interest rates showing a low level, in reflection of global financial market movements.",
        "After having risen, owing in part to the emergence of geopolitical risks, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen as political uncertainties domestically and abroad have eased.",
        "Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years’ levels, although the amount of increase has shown signs of lessening, centering around banks.",
        "Housing sales prices have exhibited slight upward movements, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the trend of domestic economic growth is likely to expand somewhat, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, conditions related to trade with major countries, the directions of the new government's economic policies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for 2017 and 2018’, discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment was that the global economy had been continuing to recover steadily and global trade had been increasing.",
        "Members also evaluated that the favorable conditions in international financial markets would continue for the time being, but FX and asset market volatility was likely to increase in line largely with changes in major countries’ monetary policies.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that exports and facilities investment had been showing growth, boosted chiefly by the favorable performances of the semiconductor and IT sectors, and consumption had maintained a modest recovery.",
        "The outlook for economic growth had been upgraded in reflection of the global trade recovery and the buoyancy of the semiconductor sector.",
        "Members noted that prices were forecast to approach the inflation target, but a little more observation was needed since there had been no clear inflationary pressures.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that the markets had been stable overall despite geopolitical risks.",
        "Members also noted that, although household debt growth was likely to slow down, there were concerns about the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent this month.",
        "The member noted that global trade and major countries’ investment and industrial production had been expanding as the cyclical recovery of the global economy took root.",
        "The member mentioned that, led by the buoyancy of the IT sector, exports and facilities investment would likely contribute significantly to Korea’s economic growth, and this trend was expected to continue next year.",
        "The member also forecast solid quantitative growth in non-IT exports and a gradual increase in related trickle-down effects on domestic demand.",
        "With regard to construction investment, the member’s assessment was that its growth rate had peaked but that it would increase slowly until next year.",
        "The member also noted that, although private sector consumption had exhibited a downward trend, the supplementary budget for this year and fiscal expansion during next year would likely boost economic activities in macroeconomic terms.",
        "The member then projected that the aforementioned external environment, trickle-down effects and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies would help GDP growth reach 3 percent this year and close to 3 percent next year as well.",
        "The member also noted that, with the Korean economy’s potential growth rate continuing to decline, the output gap was estimated to have already turned positive, and core inflation was therefore expected to near its target in the medium term.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member mentioned that household debt had increased to exceed household disposable income, reducing household consumption capacity and dragging down the potential growth rate.",
        "The member added that a large part of the negative side effects of the accommodative monetary policy stance on the real economy had been the inefficient allocation of resources, as seen in flows of capital being excessively concentrated in the real estate market.",
        "The member assessed that Korea’s economic growth was already exceeding its potential level and thus the medium-term direction of the economy appeared to be set.",
        "The member went on to state that, in order to maximize policy effectiveness, it would be appropriate to weaken the accommodative monetary policy stance somewhat, in alignment with other macroprudential policies, thereby eliminating the aforementioned side effects and achieving a balance between monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy in the future.",
        "The member took the view that, considering the need to preemptively adjust monetary policy in a situation where heightened North Korea risk had not produced any noticeable shocks on the real economy, this seemed the right time to adjust the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member added, however, that steady and fundamental structural reform was needed in order for the Korean economy to shift from a cyclical to a broader recovery.",
        "Another member presented the view that, in overall consideration of real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member then made a number of points in connection with this opinion.",
        "First, looking at the domestic real economy, goods exports and facilities investment had grown faster than expected, as the buoyancy of the semiconductor sector more than offset the North Korea risk, construction investment experienced a relatively modest adjustment, and the growth path for the second half of this year moved slightly upward, affected by the execution of the supplementary budget.",
        "As a result, the output gap was estimated to have become less negative.",
        "External demand was expected to remain favorable next year as well, led by economic recoveries in both advanced and emerging market countries.",
        "However, since construction and facilities investment was likely to go through larger adjustments and, despite increased fiscal expenditures, private consumption was forecast to show modest recovery, medium-term growth was expected to be generally consistent with the pace of potential growth.",
        "Second, with regard to inflation, consumer price inflation and core inflation had shown opposing trends; consumer price inflation had recently exceeded its target level, boosted chiefly by the base-period effect of electricity tariffs and a rise in agricultural product prices, while core inflation had been showing a modest decline since the second half of last year.",
        "Consumer price inflation was expected to fall back below its target, with the effects of regulations and one-off supply-side factors fading away toward the end of the year, and core inflation was forecast to narrow the gap with consumer price inflation, with downward pressures eased somewhat in line with the modest economic recovery.",
        "Third, the overall slack in the manufacturing sector had not shown significant improvement, as the average capacity utilization ratio fell again, with an increase in manufacturing production seen mostly in some export items such as IT products.",
        "The slack had continued to increase in the labor market as well, with the participation gap showing a sharp increase year-on-year as in the previous month, more than offsetting a slight decline in the unemployment gap.",
        "Fourth, in terms of financial stability, the Korean financial markets had shown favorable resilience despite the North Korea risk, led chiefly by improved corporate performances.",
        "In the credit market, growth in household lending by both banks and non-banks had slowed slightly, owing largely to a drop in the housing transaction volume since the implementation of housing market stabilization measures.",
        "However, this slowdown in household debt growth seemed unlikely to continue, as group loans to purchasers of new pre-sale apartments, loans for leasehold deposits, and credit loans were likely to grow steadily, and housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area were rising again.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, while raising it at an appropriate time in the not-distant future and reducing the degree of monetary easing gradually.",
        "First, looking at recent economic conditions, the member noted that the GDP growth forecast for this year, as projected by the Bank of Korea Research Department, was revised upward to 3.0 percent from 2.8 percent, while the forecast for next year remained unchanged at 2.9 percent.",
        "These figures showed that the domestic economy was maintaining sound growth despite heightened domestic and overseas uncertainties, and that the output gap, which had remained slightly negative, would turn positive soon.",
        "The member commented that, by sector, with exports remaining buoyant, the consumption recovery was expected to expand.",
        "The member also stated that, although facilities and construction investment would likely show slower growth, the growth level would be still high.",
        "Looking at price conditions, the member mentioned that, since the flattening of the Phillips curve, which implied a weaker linkage between growth and prices, had been witnessed across the world of late, Korea also was unlikely to see a large increase in underlying demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Core inflation, however, was likely to shift to a modest upward trend soon, and annual consumer price inflation for this year and the next was also forecast to show steady movements at the prices could be nonlinear depending upon the output gap, the possibility of stronger-than-expected demand-side inflationary pressures could not be ruled out.",
        "The member noted that the financial and foreign exchange markets in Korea remained stable overall, despite factors such as North Korea-related risk and changes in expectations related to domestic and overseas monetary policies.",
        "The member also commented that there was a possibility of a further slowdown of household debt growth as the government’s household debt-related policy measures were implemented going forward, but significant concerns remained about the build-up of financial imbalances.",
        "In terms of the monetary policy response to these issues, the member saw that, given the economic outlooks for this year and the next, and the risk of household debt overhang in line for instance with persistent low interest rates, the conditions were in place to reduce the degree of monetary easing gradually.",
        "The member then expressed the view, however, that, since North Korea-related risk was still having negative impacts on economic sentiment, it would be better to determine the time for a Base Rate hike after further monitoring of the development of this risk.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period, while examining whether the recent trend of economic recovery would lead to a gradual expansion in underlying inflationary pressures.",
        "The member noted that, as the world economy continued its steady recovery, led by advanced economies, demand for Korean exports had been showing strong growth.",
        "The member went on to argue that, although the effect of the Chuseok holiday should be taken into account, both export prices and volume had grown more rapidly than expected in the third quarter, thus easing the remaining concerns about the persistence of the export recovery.",
        "The member added that facilities investment was showing faster-than-expected growth, while the correction in construction investment was proceeding at a modest pace and therefore was unlikely to constrain macroeconomic recovery.",
        "The member also stated that the negative spillovers of heightened geopolitical risk related to North Korea had not yet reached a serious level.",
        "The member, however, commented that no clear sign of recovery had been detected in the labor market as labor-intensive domestic demand services industries still remained lackluster, although the recent economic recovery was heavily dependent upon the sharp increases in exports and facilities investment of some capital-intensive manufacturing industries, including semiconductors.",
        "The member judged that such labor market conditions had been constraining the recovery of private consumption, and noted that, as a result, inflationary pressures were still running below the target at the mid-1 percent range.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that household debt had soared for the past two to three years but was beginning to show slower growth since the August 2 measures, and the housing market was also showing overall stability, except for some apartment complexes being reconstructed.",
        "The member judged it advisable to maintain the current level of accommodative monetary policy for the time being in consideration of domestic economic conditions, which were lagging somewhat behind the global economic cycle.",
        "The member also found it desirable to keep a close watch on whether the foundation for economic recovery would spread to domestic demand, leading to further inflationary pressures, while examining whether risk related to household debt, which had increased sharply in line with the boom in the real estate market, would gradually diminish.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member saw that the world economy and trade had continued their overall trends of improvement, which had led the strong growth of the Korean economy.",
        "The member noted that, although facilities investment was showing robustness in line with the sharp increase in exports, there were concerns about the deterioration in service exports, which was partly due to the drop in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Korea.",
        "The member commented that private consumption was continuing its modest recovery trend, thanks for example to execution of the supplementary budget.",
        "The member also stated that, although the extent of deceleration in construction investment was not as large as expected considering the implementation of the August 2 measures to stabilize the housing market, there was a possibility that the deceleration would continue next year due to a reduction in the government’s SOC budget.",
        "The member noted that the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised the growth forecast for this year upward to 3.0 percent, while maintaining next year’s forecast at 2.9 percent.",
        "It also expected consumer price inflation to rise to around 2 percent for this year and 1.8 percent for next year.",
        "If these economic outlooks materialized, the output gap would likely turn positive from the second half of next year.",
        "The member asserted that there still was a need for additional examination of the impacts of various uncertainties, such as North Korea-related risk, a deterioration in trade conditions stemming for instance from Korea’s deployment of THAAD, and the household debt problem.",
        "On the domestic demand front, the member noted that it was also necessary to further monitor the trend of recovery in private consumption, the degree of sluggishness in construction investment and their impacts on economic activity and employment.",
        "Particularly, considering the recent low level of core inflation, there was a need to check if the price path would approach the 2-percent target next year as expected.",
        "Based on the economic outlook over a one- to two-year horizon, the member judged that the time to address the buildup of financial imbalances stemming from accommodative monetary policy was approaching.",
        "The member, however, stated that a premature change in the monetary policy stance would be just as economically burdensome as a belated resolution of financial imbalances.",
        "The member thus found it necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance for the time being, while waiting to see whether economic activity would show solid improvement.",
        "With respect to financial stability, the member expected household debt growth to continue to slow, helped by the government’s real estate measures.",
        "The member, however, expressed concern about the sustained upward trend in apartment prices in some areas.",
        "The member argued that, although the financial and foreign exchange markets remained stable overall, if North Korea-related risk continues, attention should be paid to its possible effects on capital outflows.",
        "The member went on to call for close monitoring of the impacts of the possibility of a year-end policy rate hike by the US Fed on emerging market economies.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged for the intermeeting period, but it could be necessary to raise the Base Rate soon in overall consideration of the following factors.",
        "On the real economic front, the member noted that, with the growth trend in advanced economies such as the US and the EU improving, the global trade recovery was spreading to advanced economies from emerging market economies.",
        "The member stated that this had led to double-digit growth in exports in Korea, led by semiconductors, thus causing an expansion in the growth of related facilities investment.",
        "The member commented that there was an increased possibility that the shift to an increase in world trade volume represented a trend, and thus the upswings in exports and facilities investment in Korea, which were currently limited to semiconductors, would likely expand to other major export items.",
        "This was assessed as an important determinant for the growth path of the Korean economy in the second half of this year and next year.",
        "On the domestic side, the member asserted that, although construction investment was slowing, consumption was estimated to continue modest growth, even despite remaining uncertainties.",
        "The member judged that the Bank of Korea Research Department’s upward revision to the economic growth outlook for this year from 2.8 to 3.0 percent had been made in consideration of these factors.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member stated that, in contrast with real economic activity, there had not been any particular change in inflation, and thus the Bank of Korea Research Department’s consumer price inflation projections for this year and the next were 2.0 and 1.8 percent, respectively, neither of which deviated greatly from the previous forecasts.",
        "The member noted that there had been no clear materialization of inflationary pressures, although the output gap was expected to turn positive.",
        "The member went on to argue that this point had the following implications.",
        "The member noted that the factors that had caused a decline in the real neutral interest rate, including the world economic slump and a decline in households’ propensity to consume, were gradually disappearing, and so if the Base Rate were held at the current level, the degree of monetary easing was highly likely to be automatically increased.",
        "The member thus found it necessary to raise the Base Rate to prevent any negative side effects from this.",
        "The member, however, commented that the lack of clarity with respect to inflationary pressures, and the likelihood of the real neutral interest rate increasing at a modest pace, implied that the monetary policy stance should also be shifted at a gradual pace going forward.",
        "On the financial stability front, the member judged that the government’s August policy measures to stabilize household debt had taken effect, as household lending was stabilizing, with banks’ household lending growth slowing significantly in September.",
        "The member, however, asserted that there still was concern in the international financial markets, with the CDS premium rising steadily, albeit slightly, largely owing to geopolitical risks from North Korea’s nuclear tests.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member judged that there was a growing need for a hike in the Base Rate, due mainly to the stronger global trade recovery and the sustained moderate recovery in private consumption.",
        "The member, however, did not find it desirable to shift monetary policy without providing sufficient notice, as inflationary pressures had not materialized and there still remained geopolitical risks stemming for instance from the nuclear tests.",
        "The member thus noted that it was necessary to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period, while confirming the materialization of the most recent economic outlook and raising the Base Rate soon.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point raise.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example, although government bond rates have risen in line mainly with changes in expectations related to the monetary policy normalizations of major countries.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.",
        "- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports and facilities investment have sustained their high rates of increase and private consumption has also picked up moderately.",
        "Employment conditions appear to be sustaining their trend of moderate improvement, although the pace of increase in the number of persons employed has slowed somewhat owing to temporary factors.",
        "Going forward it is forecast that the domestic economy will maintain its solid trend of growth.",
        "The GDP growth rate for this year is expected to be higher than the July projection (2.8%), and that for next year also to show its potential level.",
        "Exports seem likely to sustain their buoyancy, thanks largely to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately due to the expansion in fiscal spending for instance.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will be in the upper-1% range for some time, in line chiefly with the disappearance of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year, and then gradually approach the target level.",
        "Core inflation will meanwhile remain in the mid-1% range for the time being, before gradually rising from next year.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets price variable volatility has expanded.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, due mainly to changes in expectations concerning monetary policies at home and abroad and to geopolitical risks.",
        "Stock prices have risen, on expectations of improvements in corporate performances for example.",
        "Household lending has sustained its higher rate of increase than in past years, but the amount of increase has lessened somewhat.",
        "Although housing sales prices have shown signs of rebounding slightly in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, their uptrend has in general slowed since the government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative policy stance while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "In this process it will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that it had sustained its modest recovery, led by the US, and the growth momentum of emerging market economies had been improving, due for instance to rising commodity prices and trade growth amid stable financial conditions.",
        "Members also evaluated that international financial markets had been stable overall, with interest rates exhibiting slower growth and stock prices rising as anxiety eased.",
        "Members, however, assessed that the Trump administration’s economic policy directions and the potential policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve had been causing global financial market volatility to increase.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, while manufacturing production and facilities investment had continued to improve thanks to the recovery in exports, private consumption had remained weak, due for instance to a contraction in consumer sentiment.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members judged that market interest rates and stock prices had held steady with the stabilization of the international financial markets, but the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had remained highly volatile.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the 2% target level in January, in line mainly with oil price base effects and sharp increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and in particular on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.",
        "The member assessed that, while the trend of recovery in the world economy had been strengthening and the international financial markets had remained stable overall, the domestic economy had showed a modest growth trend, boosted by continued improvements in exports, which had more than offset sluggish consumption.",
        "Going into more detail, the member first stated that although there were high uncertainties in domestic and overseas economic conditions, the domestic economy was expected to continually hold to the January forecast path.",
        "The member then went on to present the opinion that concerns about the possibility of an economic crisis, raised by some, were premised on various risk factors materializing simultaneously, and thus such concerns did not seem reasonable.",
        "Next, the member anticipated that, although consumer price inflation in January had risen to the 2% target level, inflation for the year as a whole was unlikely to diverge greatly from the January projection (1.8%), as prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products stabilized.",
        "Meanwhile, looking at financial conditions, although a movement toward a slower increase in bank lending to households had continued in January 2017 from December last year, this was attributable in part to seasonal factors, and thus, it was difficult to say at this stage that household lending growth would fundamentally slow.",
        "The member also noted that the won-dollar exchange rate had fluctuated of late, but this reflected the high openness of the Korean FX market, and thus the negative perceptions of economic agents with respect to high exchange rate volatility should shift toward acceptance of this reality as normal.",
        "Last, the member noted that, although the decoupling of the monetary polices of major countries had continued, other major country central banks were showing signs of narrowing the degrees of their monetary easing, and the member called attention to the point that if there are changes in major countries’ monetary policy stances, additional Fed rate hikes may have greater-than-expected impacts on the domestic and international financial markets.",
        "Taking these points in overall consideration, the member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and in particular on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed that, in terms of the real economy, the trend of In particular, construction investment had shown a gentle correction instead of plunging as initially anticipated, but the consumption slump was fairly significant, with consumption remaining on the decline month-on-month since November last year.",
        "The member went on to point out that consumption could pose downside risks to economic growth going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, as exports had grown at a faster pace for the fourth consecutive month since November last year, due mainly to increased demand in the global semiconductor market and recoveries in petroleum product exports in line with rising oil prices, there was a heightened possibility that this could represent a trend going forward.",
        "The member, however, commented that the Trump government’s protectionist trade stance was lurking as a risk factor.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member assessed that the path for the real economy for this year would not diverge greatly from the Bank of Korea Research Department’s January outlook.",
        "In terms of prices, the member noted that consumer price inflation in January stood higher than expected at 2%, but this was attributable to one-off supply shocks such as rising prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products in line with the outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease, as well as to rising oil prices.",
        "The member accordingly judged that there was little risk of the price inflation path far exceeding the path forecast in January.",
        "Given an empirical analysis showing that inflation expectations in small open economies are affected by global price movements, the member anticipated that the recent trend in the world economy of moving away from low inflation was likely to serve as a positive factor in lessening the burden on domestic monetary policy related to achieving the inflation target.",
        "Last, in terms of financial stability, the member assessed that household debt growth was stabilizing, with household lending growth having decreased significantly in January 2017 as in December last year.",
        "The member, however, noted that, considering that housing transactions are usually in full swing from March and act as a demand-side factor for lending to households, it was appropriate to keep a close eye on actual developments in household debt to determine whether it has been stabilized.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member mentioned that, in implementing monetary policy going forward, attention should be paid to the recent inflation trend while taking into consideration predictable causes of economic uncertainty.",
        "The member assessed that, although consumer price inflation had risen significantly in January, inflation in 2017 was unlikely to deviate far from the January forecast of 1.8 percent, and went on to argue that, based on the forecast that supply-side inflation pressures would not be large, it would be possible to maintain accommodative monetary policy in consideration of downside pressures to the economy.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted the growing need to maintain monetary accomodation due to the worsening employment situation following corporate restructuring, and mentioned that preventing employment quality from declining would be important to prevent household debt problems from worsening.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member expressed the view that, although the increase in household debt had continued to slow in January as in December last year, it was a little too early to assess that its growth had slowed, considering that January was typically a slow month for the real estate market and thus did not usually register large increases in household debt.",
        "The member added that a close watch should be kept on whether the slowdown in household debt growth would continue from March onwards.",
        "The member went on to stress that the international financial markets had been stable overall and attention should be paid to potentially destabilizing external factors.",
        "Meanwhile, one member took the view that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, it would be appropriate to estimate the effects on Korea’s macroeconomy from domestic demand and exports, which had shown conflicting directions since the fourth quarter last year.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had continued to exhibit a moderate recovery, crude oil and other commodity prices had rebounded, and asset prices had shown an upward trend in advanced countries, which had helped Korea’s exports shift to an increase and acted as a factor supporting a rebound in manufacturing production and facilities investment in related industries.",
        "However, the member expressed concerns about a number of factors that could weigh on domestic demand: growth in construction investment had slowed as the real estate market had begun to stabilize in line with stronger government regulations and the rebound of market interest rates; the consumer sentiment index had plunged; retail sales and services production had slowed down; and employment had declined following structural reform in vulnerable industries.",
        "Concerning prices, the member assessed that consumer price inflation had reached the 2-percent target in January in line with the relatively fast growth in import prices, but core inflation had remained at the mid-1-percent level, and therefore it seemed unlikely that demand-side inflation was increasing.",
        "In this regard, the member expressed the opinion that future monetary policy should be implemented based on a thorough analysis of how the conflicting trends of export demand and domestic demand since the fourth quarter of last year would affect Korea’s macroeconomy.",
        "The member went on to argue that the analysis should focus on whether the recovery in demand from exports, boosted by reflation in the global economy, would sufficiently offset the sluggishness of domestic demand caused by domestic economic problems so that the negative output gap could be resolved and underlying inflation could rise gradually to its target of 2 percent.",
        "One member took the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25 percent this month.",
        "The member stated that the US-led global economic recovery was gradually gaining momentum and global prices seemed to have shifted to an increase, centering around commodity prices.",
        "The member added that there remained, however, substantial uncertainties regarding normalization of the global economy and expressed concerns that US rate hikes could lead to sudden financial market unrest and to US dollar liquidity crunches in some EMEs.",
        "With this global situation spreading to Korea, the member mentioned that the following three points should be considered: First, the member pointed out that the fact that improvement in the global economy had boosted the recovery in Korea’s exports was a positive development, but it was unclear whether this recovery would continue, and its spillover effects on overall domestic demand could be limited.",
        "Second, the member mentioned that increasing volatility in line with the market-determined exchange rate was a great asset to Korea as it faced uncertainties.",
        "The member particularly assessed that, as overseas investment was expanding in accordance with investment diversification, increased savings in preparation for the lengthening of life expectancy and reduced domestic-overseas interest rate differentials, upward and downward exchange rate pressures decreased in the regional spot markets, despite the current account surplus, while the domestic market responded more sensitively to the global dollar value and global investors.",
        "Third, the member expressed the view that maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy would share the same goal with resolving macroeconomic imbalances, since boosting domestic demand could help reduce an excessive current account surplus.",
        "In conclusion, the member’s assessment was that Korea’s monetary policy stance should be adjusted in line with changes in economic conditions, such as the global economic recovery, growth in Korea’s exports, increased domestic demand, domestic and overseas inflation, and developments in the global financial markets, and also according to the consequent channel of the natural rate of interest, and went on to assess that as several uncertainties remained there was currently no great need for an interest rate adjustment within the foreseeable future.",
        "One other member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that concerning the domestic real economy, with export volumes as well as export unit prices showing recovery, manufacturing production and facilities investment had continued to improve and construction investment had also shown favorable movements, while growth in domestic demand, including that in the services sector, had been slowing due to the sustained sluggishness in private consumption.",
        "The member went on to note that short-term upside and downside risks had seemed to be overall in balance, and uncertainties surrounding the medium-term growth path had remained very high.",
        "Second, the member mentioned that inflation had accelerated to reach its target, led mostly by supply-side factors including a surge in agricultural and livestock product prices and the base-period effect of oil prices.",
        "Concerning future inflation, the member forecast that upside risks would somewhat predominate in the short term, but with the effects of supply-side factors gradually diminishing, inflation would not deviate far from the January forecast path in the medium term.",
        "Third, the member noted that although production slack had grown recently, production had then exhibited signs of picking up somewhat, with exports showing recovery and manufacturing’s production growth exceeding its production capacity growth for the second consecutive month, more than offsetting a slight decline in the average capacity utilization rate of the manufacturing sector in December.",
        "As for the labor market in January, the member pointed out that the overall slack in the labor force had not shown any significant change, with the unemployment gap increasing and the participation gap decreasing month on month, but the recent trend of improvement had clearly slowed.",
        "Fourth, with regard to financial stability conditions, the member stated that foreign bond investment had shifted to a net inflow and the term premiums for long-term bonds and corporate bond credit spreads had remained stable.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that growth in household debt appeared to be slowing somewhat, particularly in the banking sector, due mainly to a drop in housing transaction volume and strengthened risk management, but lending by non-bank financial institutions had shown faster growth than in previous years owing chiefly to the base-period effect of bank lending.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period while securing policy space.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, as the trend of rising stock prices has continued and stock price volatility has diminished as well.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in the euro area.",
        "moderate growth, as exports have improved although the recovery in domestic demand activities has been weak due to a slump in consumption.",
        "Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the extent of decline in the number of persons employed having widened in the manufacturing sector and the trend of increase in persons employed in the service sector having slowed as well.",
        "The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and expects growth to be generally in accord with the path projected in January.",
        "Compared to the January forecasts the Board judges that consumption will likely fall somewhat below the level projected, due to a continuing deterioration in economic sentiment for example, but that exports and facilities investment will improve more than forecast thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery.",
        "mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has risen to the upper-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at a level close to 2%, but for the year as a whole not diverge greatly from the January projection (1.8%) as the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products recover their trends of stability.",
        "Core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "and long-term market interest rates have subsided as the stability in the global financial markets has continued.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen to a large extent, owing mainly to a shift to US dollar weakening in line with the new US government’s policies related to the exchange rate.",
        "The extent of growth in bank household lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in household lending by non-banks has been sustained.",
        "Housing sales prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country have remained generally steady.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment was that the global economy had been continuing to recover and the global trade recovery had been expanding.",
        "Members also evaluated that the global financial markets had been showing stable movements overall.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that private consumption was continuing to recovery moderately, with exports sustaining their trend of solid recovery and facilities investment maintaining favorable movements.",
        "Members also assessed that the trend of real economic growth had been sustained, with the North Korea risk and the possibility of deterioration in trade conditions with China easing somewhat and sentiment indices improving.",
        "Members noted that inflation had fallen slightly short of the 2-percent target, but it was forecast to gradually approach the target level and fluctuate at around 2 percent.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members stated that the markets had been stable overall.",
        "Members also noted that, although the household lending growth was slowing somewhat, it was still high compared to past years, and thus a close watch should be kept on the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate by One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.5 percent this month.",
        "The member noted that, in the real sector, the pace of economic growth was accelerating, boosted for instance by strong exports, favorable facilities investment, and the sustained moderate recovery in private consumption, and the real economy had been sustaining its trend of solid growth even after October.",
        "The member saw that the expanded recovery in global trade, in particular, amid strengthened improvements in world economic activity had been driving the positive movements of the Korean economy.",
        "The member went on to comment that there was a possibility of further improvements in the external real economic environment, thanks for instance to improved conditions related to trade with China.",
        "The member evaluated that, since private consumption had been continuing to improve modestly, a faster recovery in private consumption could be expected, but strong exports were still having limited spillover effects on domestic demand.",
        "The member then projected that GDP growth for 2017 was very likely to exceed the Bank of Korea Research Department’s October outlook of 3.0 percent.",
        "With respect to inflation, meanwhile, the member stated that inflationary pressures had still not yet clearly materialized, and with the price path showing little reactivity to real economic trends, low inflation had recently been a common problem for not only Korea, but also major advanced economies, and had been the focus of discussion and concern for monetary authorities.",
        "With respect to the causes of this phenomenon, the member explained that inflationary pressures might be small, despite faster growth, since the output gap was still close to zero; inflationary adjustments might be restrained due to intensified global competition and e-commerce growth; and persistently low inflation might have caused a fall in inflation expectations.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that, since all these factors seemed to be at work to some extent in Korea, the rise in inflation was very likely to be gradual going forward.",
        "The member noted that there were two implications related to the policy rate decision in light of macroeconomic trends.",
        "First, real economic trends implied that the factors that had caused a decline in the real neutral interest rate since the global financial crisis were gradually disappearing, and thus if the Base Rate were held at the current level, the degree of monetary easing would likely increase automatically.",
        "Therefore, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate in reflection of this point.",
        "Second, given no clear materialization of inflationary pressures, the monetary policy stance should also be shifted at a gradual pace while checking the movements of the price path, and it should be constantly reviewed whether price inflation was approaching the target level in a stable manner.",
        "The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall consideration, the factors favoring a hike in the Base Rate as discussed at the last Monetary Policy Board meeting had been confirmed by economic trends, and so it was appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent.",
        "The member added that the Board should also consider an additional Base Rate hike in the future, but in choosing the timing for the additional hike, the focus should be placed on the price path rather than real economic trends.",
        "Another member agreed to some extent with the recognition that, with respect to the recent macroeconomic trends, the time was approaching to reflect on the accommodative monetary policy which had been continuing for the past years, and to give careful thought to the future monetary policy direction.",
        "The member expressed the view that, while the accommodative monetary policy thus far had been working as a factor causing faster growth in household debt, it was assessed to have contributed greatly to easing deflation concerns by limiting the possibility of further deterioration in domestic economic activity amid difficult economic environments at home and abroad.",
        "The member noted that Korea’s export recovery was gradually solidifying due to the consolidation of the world economic recovery, and there were positive factors for domestic demand, such as the government’s plans for expansionary fiscal policy and the easing of concerns about the North Korea risk.",
        "The member thus assessed downside risks to the macroeconomy to be diminishing somewhat overall.",
        "The member, however, noted that there was significant spare capacity in the labor market, that aggregate demand was still not sufficient as underlying price inflation was running well below the 2-percent target level, and that the spillover effects of the export recovery on domestic demand, employment and prices were relatively unlikely to be great, since the recovery was concentrated in some capital-intensive industries, such as semiconductors.",
        "The member stated the opinion that, given these factors, it still seemed uncertain as to whether the Korean economy had reached a state of soundness that necessitated an immediate reduction of the degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The member pointed out that a rapid tightening under these conditions could cause a risk of difficulties in converging underlying price inflation to the target level, and could also work to reduce maneuvering room for a flexible interest rate policy going forward.",
        "The member noted that the continuation of accommodative monetary policy could impose a burden by allowing financial imbalances to accumulate, represented by household debt growth, but assessed that the current composition of household debt was unlikely to undermine the soundness of major financial institutions and thereby threaten the overall financial markets.",
        "The member then commented that a close watch should be kept on changes in the housing market, which had contracted since the August 2 measures, and changes in household debt should also be closely monitored.",
        "The member went on to emphasize that, from a more fundamental point of view, financial stability should be pursued first through macroprudential policy, and financial stability would be furthered by reducing as much as possible the chance of undermining price stability, which is the primary objective of monetary policy.",
        "The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the month, while monitoring the degree of positive effects of recent changes in conditions on the Korean economy, given the need for a cautious approach to changing the monetary policy stance at this juncture.",
        "The member went on to express the opinion that an adjustment to the degree of the monetary policy accommodation should be decided prudently such that the convergence of underlying price inflation to the target level is not undermined.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent this month.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had maintained its trend of recovery, and investment and exports had induced improvement in consumption, although such improvement had been relatively limited.",
        "The member also stated that, due to several structural problems, it was unclear how long this trend of recovery would last.",
        "The member mentioned that the Korean economy had continued to exhibit growth in line with its forecast path, exports and investment seemed to have led consumption gradually, and it was the right time to reexamine the appropriateness of the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In particular, the member presented the view that there was a need to examine the trade-off between the pace at which financial imbalances widened and the speed at which the inflation gap narrowed.",
        "First, concerning the output gap, the member noted that, according to the estimation of the potential growth rate in terms of both consumption and incomes, the output gap was seen to have already turned positive.",
        "Second, with regard to financial imbalances, the member argued that financial liabilities had been growing rapidly under the accommodative monetary policy, and that if the degree of policy accommodation exceeds the level that the economic structure can utilize optimally, this could lead to inefficiency of resource allocation.",
        "Third, regarding the inflation gap, the rate of growth in prices of items influenced by domestic demand pressures had already remained in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent, but that of items whose prices were determined by items such as industrial and agricultural, livestock & fisheries products had been fluctuating around the target of 2 percent.",
        "The member also pointed out that, as domestic demand pressures were expected to grow steadily next year while the average OECD inflation rate was forecast to somewhat exceed 2 percent due largely to a rise in global commodity prices, inflation was likely to fluctuate at around its target of 2 percent, and added that the survey on inflation expectations had also shown that economic agents seemed to be well aware of the The member expressed the view that, in conclusion, it would be appropriate to reduce monetary easing somewhat while price stability was being secured to some extent, in order to prevent financial imbalances from expanding further and harmonize monetary policy with the government’s fiscal policy to be implemented going forward.",
        "The member went on to argue that, with such policy harmonization, it would be desirable to anchor the Korean economy at its potential growth rate, which had decreased, so as to promote medium-term price stability.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent from the current 1.25 percent this month.",
        "The member stated that, looking at the recent economic situation, the domestic economy seemed to have sustained a strong recovery, boosted by the global economic recovery.",
        "The member mentioned that, compared with the October forecast, the GDP growth rate for the third quarter had been higher than projected, major downside risks such as North Korea-related geopolitical risks and the possibility of a continued worsening of trade relations with China had eased, and sentiment indexes for economic agents in the private sector seemed to have been improving.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, despite this economic situation, inflationary pressures had not yet appeared, considering the global low inflation due to structural factors, the time lag in the transmission of business activities to prices, and the current output gap remaining at near zero, as Fed Chair Yellen had acknowledged when she referred to low inflation as a core inflation were forecast to remain close to their target of 2 percent on average this year and the next.",
        "The member noted that, looking at financial markets, market interest rates and stock prices had risen, the won had been strengthening, and household debt had continued to exhibit a slowdown in growth.",
        "The member stated, however, that household debt still remained high and, as showed by the results of the systemic risk survey conducted in the second half of 2017, continued to be considered the largest risk factor facing the Korean economy.",
        "Next, regarding how monetary policy should respond to this situation, the member noted that the Korean economy had maintained strong growth at or slightly exceeding its potential growth level, and inflation was overall unlikely to deviate far from its target.",
        "The member went on to state that an excessive degree of monetary easing could trigger credit growth and push up asset prices, imposing burdens on promoting financial stability, and in this regard it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate slightly by 25 basis points.",
        "One member assessed that it would be necessary to adjust the degree of monetary easing and raise the Base Rate to 1.50 percent from the current 1.25 percent.",
        "With regard to the timing of the rate hike, the member expressed the view that it would be more desirable to monitor financial and FX market conditions at the end of the year and raise the rate early in 2018 when the economic forecasts start to take shape, but the member also agreed with the idea of moving the rate hike forward a month or two by raising the rate this month.",
        "The member went on to stress that, after raising the rate, it would be necessary to take time to closely examine financial stability conditions, including trends of business activities, inflation and household debt.",
        "The member assessed that, with the global economy continuing to improve, the Korean economy had maintained its trend of recovery led by exports, and private consumption had been recovering at a modest pace.",
        "The member added that the Korean economy was expected to sustain GDP growth at its potential level in 2018 and 2019, with the recovery of private consumption solidifying, household income conditions picking up, and employment conditions showing gradual improvement, particularly in the services sector.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had been fluctuating around its target of 2.0 percent for this year and core inflation had remained below 2 percent, but if the economic recovery continued next year, underlying inflation was expected to rise gradually.",
        "The member also took the view that the economy seemed to have reached the point where the degree of monetary accommodation could be reduced, as the output gap had been originally forecast to turn positive in the second half of 2018 but was likely to do so earlier, boosted by the recent faster-than-expected GDP growth, and the inflation gap was expected to narrow with consumer price inflation and core inflation having nearly reached their targets.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member noted that it was now necessary to cope with the accumulation of financial imbalances caused by the recent accommodative monetary policy, and stressed that if the need to maintain the accommodative policy in terms of business activities and inflation had decreased somewhat, more attention should be paid to dealing with the buildup of financial imbalances, such as household debt.",
        "The member took the view that reducing the degree of monetary easing could raise concerns about the household debt burdens of vulnerable borrowers, but the member expressed the hope that the aggressive measures announced by the government to address the problems facing vulnerable groups would take effect.",
        "With regard to financial and FX markets, the member mentioned that, while stock prices and market interest rates had risen, the exchange rate had fallen significantly, affected chiefly by the current account surplus caused by strong exports, and added that some had raised concerns that the rapid appreciation of the Korean won would negatively affect exports and other real economic sectors.",
        "The member went on to stress the need to closely monitor FX market trends going forward.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent from the current With regard to the real economy, the member noted that the growth momentum had been strengthening gradually; strong external demand had led exports and facilities investment, and private consumption had exhibited modest recovery, boosted chiefly by the effects of the supplementary budget and improved economic sentiment.",
        "The member also assessed that consumer price inflation had slowed and fallen below its target, due mainly to temporary supply-side factors, while core inflation had rebounded from the previous downward trend and overall remained close to the path forecast in October.",
        "In terms of slack in the production sector, the member mentioned that the average capacity utilization ratio had continued to decline, with production growth resulting from strong exports seen in some industries only, and as a result there had not been significant improvements in overall production slack, despite the economic recovery.",
        "The member went on to state that, in the labor market, with growth in the participation and time gaps more than offsetting a decrease in the unemployment gap, the slack in the labor force had increased but the pace of its growth had slowed for the second consecutive month.",
        "Looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that, despite government measures, group loans to apartment purchasers, leasehold deposit loans and credit loans had steadily grown and maintained stronger growth than in normal years, and that corporate loans had also increased particular ─ and the real-estate exposures of private sector credit had continued to increase accordingly.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in overall consideration of real economic and inflation trends and financial stability conditions, the fact that the upward movement of the growth path had helped eliminate the negative output gap earlier than expected and brought about a rebound of core inflation indicated that it was appropriate to slightly adjust the degree of monetary easing in comparison to the neutral interest rate.",
        "The member went on to state that, despite this adjustment, the real interest rate remained below the neutral interest rate and the finance-neutral natural interest rate, leading to the conclusion that accommodative financial conditions could be maintained.",
        "The member also argued that, as comprehensive household debt measures would take effect gradually with a time lag, the household debt-to-income ratio that had already restricted consumption would continue to rise for the time being, and mentioned that the risk of total private sector credit, including corporate loans, being concentrated in real estate-related areas was likely to remain high.",
        "With regard to monetary policy operation, the member argued that there was a growing need to preemptively consider the possibility that the buildup of financial imbalances could restrict appropriate consumption channels, leading to inefficient resource allocation and undermining the bank intermediary function in the medium and long term, having negative impacts on future economic welfare.",
        "Concerning the future monetary policy direction, the member took the view that it would be necessary to maintain the current monetary easing stance until inflation became firmly entrenched and the forecast that inflation would converge to its target became stronger.",
        "The member went on to point out that whether, and how fast, additional Base Rate adjustments should be made needed to be carefully determined in consideration of changes in core inflation, the degree of private consumption recovery and the effects of changes in the global financial cycle on the real neutral interest rate.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Dongchul Cho expressed clear opposition to the idea of raising the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and argued for holding it at its current level.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%, for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "The global financial markets have shown stable movements, with stock prices displaying moderate upward trends for example.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.",
        "has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have sustained their high rate of increase.",
        "The trend of improvement in employment conditions has shown signs of weakening somewhat, with the pace of increase in the number of persons employed in the service sector having slowed for example.",
        "Going forward, the Board expects that domestic economic growth will be slightly above the rate projected in October, as domestic demand activities including consumption and facilities investment continue their trends of moderate improvement, and exports also sustain their buoyancy thanks largely to the pickup in the global economic recovery and the improved conditions related to trade with China.",
        "consequence mainly of declines in the extents of increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and the disappearance of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been rising slightly in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has stayed at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will be in the mid-1% range for some time and then gradually approach the target level.",
        "Core inflation will also rise gradually.",
        "expectations related to monetary policy, the domestic financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with stock prices continuing to rise in line for example with improvements in corporate performances.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has meanwhile fallen, owing chiefly to the strengthening recovery of the domestic economy.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending is slowing somewhat, but is still sustaining a high level compared to past years.",
        "Housing sales prices have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, although their uptrend has in general slowed since the government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the recovery of the global economy had generally been sustained, and world trade had also been showing improvement.",
        "Members also evaluated that in the international financial markets, volatility in price variables had increased, influenced for instance by geopolitical risks and changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, although exports had remained buoyant and consumption had maintained its trend of modest increase, it was necessary to be mindful of uncertainties, including geopolitical risks.",
        "The trend of economic growth was generally not expected to deviate far from the path forecast last July.",
        "With regard to prices, meanwhile, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the 2-percent level, boosted mainly by increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and by the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year, while core inflation had remained in the 1-percent range.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members mentioned that price variable volatility had expanded, mostly due to increases in geopolitical risks.",
        "Members noted that attention should be paid to the accumulation of financial imbalances, as household lending had continued to sustain its high rate of increase.",
        "Further observation was also needed with respect to the effects of the government’s policy measures related to real estate and household debt.",
        "posted on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month, while analyzing uncertainties related to economic activities and prices, and evaluating the possibility of increased burdens from financial stability issues.",
        "The member noted that international trade had continued to show a clear trend of recovery with the global economy continuing to improve.",
        "However, in contrast to such favorable global economic conditions, uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy had expanded since the release of the July outlook, due mainly to a deterioration in trade conditions with China stemming from a conflict with China related to Korea’s decision to deploy THAAD, and risks related to North Korea.",
        "The member commented that, although exports had been continuing to show a solid recovery, factors such as the deterioration in trade conditions with China had been working to increase the negative impacts on both goods and services exports, thus requiring ongoing monitoring of trade with China on an item-by-item basis.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, in the job market as well, factors such as the decline in the number of Chinese tourists were likely to limit the employment expansion in the services sector, and a relatively large-scale correction in the construction market would inevitably have negative impacts on employment in the construction sector.",
        "The member noted that, in general, economic growth and prices in the second half of this year would likely be consistent with their July forecasts, but various upside and downside risks had been growing of late.",
        "The member thus expressed the need to keep a close watch on whether the output gap could be closed earlier or later than originally forecast, and stated that consideration should be given to economic conditions not only of next year, but also of the following years.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that, in terms of financial stability, concerns about recent household debt growth and possible capital outflows in line with mounting geopolitical risks had grown since the July meeting.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the government’s policy measures were likely to slow the increase in household debt, their effects might appear slowly, due mainly to an expected increase in housing availability.",
        "The member then stressed that the sharp increase in geopolitical risks related to North Korea called for stepped-up monitoring of foreign capital flows and foreign exchange market trends.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to continuously examine the impacts of expected changes in major country monetary policies on EME markets.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level in August, in overall consideration of a number of points.",
        "First, the member noted that although the real economy was showing export-oriented and facilities investment-led growth, the buoyancy of exports had been confined to the IT industry, mainly in semiconductors, and since such strength was attributable to increases in unit export prices rather than growth in export volume, it was not likely to stimulate much additional production in related industries.",
        "The member stated that with the expected slowdown in construction having been offset by the contribution of facilities investment to growth, household consumption had been continuing its modest trend of growth at the lower-2 percent range.",
        "The member noted that, although there still remained uncertainties about improvements in exports and consumption, the Bank of Korea’s economic growth rate forecast of 2.8 percent was neutral, and considering the secular decline in the potential growth rate, the output gap seemed to be close to zero.",
        "With respect to prices, the member expressed the view that the increase in consumer price inflation to the lower-2 percent range had been led by temporary increases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, but core inflation was still running at the mid-1 percent range, and it was expected to run somewhat below the 2-percent target this year.",
        "The member then addressed the pattern of inflation running below the target despite an accommodative monetary policy in which the Base Rate was set lower than the neutral interest rate, pointing to two possible causes of this phenomenon.",
        "The first was a structural factor where the neutral interest rate suggested by the potential growth rate on the demand side was much lower than that on the supply side.",
        "The second factor was a possibility that the actual inflation expectations of economic agents had fallen substantially.",
        "The member stated that both reasons seemed to be affected not only by domestic factors, but also by global factors.",
        "The member noted that the output gap was close to zero and consumer price inflation was nearing 2 percent, which suggested a heightened need for narrowing the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member, however, commented that the causes of low inflation had not yet been resolved.",
        "The member thus found it necessary to exercise caution in choosing the timing for adjusting the Base Rate, in order to carry out monetary policy in a manner consistent with the management of inflation expectations.",
        "With respect to financial stability, the member observed that household debt accumulation had increased the exposure of households to real estate price fluctuation risks, and thus there was an increased possibility that a drop in real estate prices could trigger macro risks, such as a decline in household consumption and contraction in the real economy, through the medium of debt.",
        "To stabilize household debt, the member judged it desirable to respond with micro-policy instruments first, considering that the overheating of real estate markets differed depending upon the region and its characteristics.",
        "With respect to the August 2 measures focused on preventing overheating in the new housing market and curbing the related buildup of mortgage lending, the member judged them as appropriate considering the rapid increase in household debt, particularly in the new housing market and smaller-sized apartment transaction market in the Seoul Metropolitan region over the past two years.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, in this regard, the signs of a slowdown in construction investment were positive from a financial stability perspective.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that the global economy had maintained its trend of recovery and the global trade volume had been improving slightly.",
        "The member also mentioned that the US Fed would likely normalize its monetary policy despite uncertainties regarding whether inflation could draw close to its target, and suggested that this was because the US labor market was strengthening and there were concerns about negative side effects from prolonged low interest rates.",
        "The member pointed out that Korea’s export volume had rebounded along with the global trade volume and had then started to show slower growth again.",
        "Korea’s financial markets had been generally stabilizing, while the FX market and foreign investment had been responding sensitively to geopolitical risks.",
        "The recovery of the domestic economy had not yet solidified, despite the sustained construction investment and the recently favorable facilities investment.",
        "Considering the effects of the supplementary budget, however, the member did not expect the economy to deviate far from the path forecast last July, and core inflation had remained within the mid-1 percent range while consumer price inflation had slightly exceeded its target.",
        "Core inflation was low despite monetary easing, a fact that the member attributed to a number of factors, including the structural weakening of Korea’s exports and domestic demand due to changing global demand for trade goods, geopolitical factors, population aging, the slowdown in household income growth and increased savings in line with the surging household debt and income imbalances.",
        "With all of this taken into consideration, the member assessed that the current real economic growth rate was not falling short of its potential.",
        "The member stated that in this situation, accommodative monetary policy had not led to a change in the medium-term trend of growth and inflation, and financial imbalances had been swelling excessively.",
        "In addition, a substantial portion of household debt had flowed into the housing market, suggesting that there was a strong likelihood of oversupply in the housing market from the end of this year to the year after next, a period when the number of newly completed apartments would rise sharply.",
        "In light of this, leverage did not seem to have been used effectively.",
        "Considering this situation, the member judged that the Bank of Korea would have to adjust its monetary policy stance in line with monetary policy normalization by advanced countries, but the situation was not sufficiently urgent to justify a change in course amid steadily escalating geopolitical risks.",
        "More time was needed to observe developments of the global economy and financial markets, movements of household debt, and the effects of the recent government measures to stabilize the housing market.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy seemed to have sustained a strong recovery and was expected to continue to improve as forecast in July this year ─ although geopolitical risks related to North Korea and the changing relationship with China could act as negative factors, the global economic recovery and the government’s supplementary budget implementation were expected to serve as positive factors.",
        "Turning to inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation had risen to slightly exceed its target of 2 percent, but this was expected to be short-lived owing to a lack of demand-side pressures driven by economic recovery.",
        "The member pointed out that the volatility of price variables in the financial and foreign exchange markets had increased, affected mainly by the North Korea risk and changes in expectations of major country monetary policies.",
        "The North Korea risk, in particular, had caused foreign portfolio investment to shift to a net outflow recently, despite Korea’s favorable external soundness.",
        "Although these changes were expected to have only limited impacts, the member urged that a close watch should be kept on how the high uncertainties of the North Korea risk would affect the financial and foreign exchange markets as well as the real economy.",
        "With regard to household lending, its growth was expected to slow, affected by the government measures to stabilize the real estate market and to curb household debt growth, but there remained deep concerns about the buildup of financial imbalances, including the sharp rise in household lending and the already high household debt ratio.",
        "Next, regarding how monetary policy should respond to this situation, the member pointed out that reducing the degree of monetary easing could be considered in economic and financial stability terms.",
        "Given the recently heightened uncertainty surrounding the growth path, the fact that further easing was not urgently needed in terms of inflation, and the effects of the government measures to curb household debt, however, the member stated that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time.",
        "Meanwhile, while closely examining developments of domestic and overseas economic conditions, attention should be paid to the degree and pace of monetary easing so as to maintain price and financial stability over a medium-term horizon.",
        "One member assessed that, in overall consideration of financial stability conditions and the real economic and inflation trends, it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "First, with regard to the real economy, the member stated that, although construction and facilities investment had gone through a gradual correction, the economy was estimated to have sustained growth generally consistent with the pace of potential growth, with exports maintaining a favorable recovery and private consumption continuing to recover gradually.",
        "The growth path for the second half of the year was not expected to deviate far from the path forecast last July, but upside and downside risks surrounding it were seen to have increased somewhat from a month earlier.",
        "Second, looking at inflation, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had risen slightly above its target, affected chiefly by a rise in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and by the effects of temporary electricity tariff cuts last year.",
        "Toward the fourth quarter of this year, however, inflation was expected to decline slightly to around the target level, with the base-period effects from temporary supply shocks and regulations fading away.",
        "Core inflation, meanwhile, had remained flat below 2 percent, and despite the recent economic recovery, demand-side inflation pressures were not seen to be significantly increasing in terms of various indicators such as core PCEPI and core inflation with regulated prices excluded.",
        "Third, with respect to the manufacturing sector, the member stated that the average capacity utilization ratio had rebounded and the sales to inventory ratio had remained low, but since export volumes and production had not exhibited solidly based growth, more time was needed to observe developments of the slack in the production sector.",
        "In the labor market, the slack in the labor force had continued to increase, with growth in the time gap more than offsetting the lack of substantial changes in the unemployment and participation gaps.",
        "Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that stock prices had fallen and market interest rate volatility had increased, due to the emergence of the North Korea risk and also to the net outflows of foreign portfolio investment, particularly of short-term funds such as those held by banks and global funds.",
        "In the credit market, meanwhile, corporate lending had not exhibited substantial growth despite the economic recovery, while household lending had maintained strong growth exceeding the nominal growth rate, led mainly by a rise in housing transactions and demand for lending prior to the implementation of stronger regulations.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, taking into consideration the recent overall macroeconomic conditions, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "First, the member stated that the relatively fast pace of economic recovery during the first quarter of the year seemed to have slowed somewhat since the second quarter.",
        "Although global trade growth had been accelerating, Korea’s export volume growth had been faltering since the second quarter.",
        "The worsening conflicts with China, in particular, had been having increasing negative impacts on Korea’s exports to China, and China’s continued travel regulations were weighing heavily on Korea’s services production growth.",
        "Meanwhile, despite a hike in the Consumer Expectation Index, indicators related to real-sector consumption had continued to exhibit only modest improvements, while construction investment was entering a correction phase after having surged over the last couple of years.",
        "Going forward, the member found it difficult to expect faster economic recovery for the time being, considering the negative effects of conflicts with China and the slowing trend of construction investment.",
        "The government’s supplementary budget was likely to expand aggregate demand, but its effects were difficult to predict, and geopolitical risks related to North Korea were recently increasing.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation was exceeding 2 percent, influenced by hikes in prices of some agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and the electricity tariff cuts last year, but with one-off factors excluded, there were no signs of an increase in demand-side inflation pressures.",
        "Housing prices had also surged in Seoul and some other regions, but on a nationwide average basis, their growth remained at a level similar to consumer price inflation.",
        "The member also noted that household debt had continued to grow at a worrying pace, but considering the effects of the real estate measures announced on August 2 this year and the announcements of additional household debt measures, it seemed necessary to keep an eye on developments of related indicators.",
        "In this regard, the member found it advisable to maintain the current monetary easing stance so as to support the uptrend in prices and help achieve the inflation target, while keeping a close watch on whether household debt growth would make a soft-landing.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economic recovery has continued to expand.",
        "Global financial market volatility has meanwhile increased somewhat, due mainly to changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries and to geopolitical risks.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and geopolitical risks.",
        "has continued, as exports have sustained their high rate of increase and consumption has recovered moderately although investment has temporarily slowed.",
        "Employment conditions have improved moderately, with the employment-to-population ratio having risen as the trend of year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, centering around the manufacturing sector.",
        "Going forward domestic economic growth is expected to be generally in accord with the path projected in July.",
        "The Board judges that consumption will likely continue its moderate trend of recovery, due to the improvement in employment condition and to the execution of a supplementary budget.",
        "Facilities investment will likely be above the levels forecast in July, due to expanded IT industry investment.",
        "Exports are expected to fall below the July projection, however, as service exports have slowed owing to a decline in the number of foreign tourists, while construction investment will probably also be less than forecast, in consequence of real estate market stability.",
        "mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and with the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole show the level (1.9%) projected in July.",
        "Core inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "with stock prices, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate and long-term market interest rates having fluctuated to considerable extents, in line with increases in geopolitical risks.",
        "Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years’ levels, although the amount of year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat.",
        "In the housing market, the trend of rising sales prices has slowed since the government’s announcement of housing market stabilization measures.",
        "□ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."

        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic Developments' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, most members agreed that emerging markets maintained favorable movements and advanced economies including the US continued to recover, although their paces of growth had slowed somewhat.",
        "However, some members assessed global economic uncertainty to be increasing further, given the instability of certain economic indicators in advanced countries and their moves toward fiscal policy tightening.",
        "As for recent domestic economic developments, most members' assessment was that the domestic economy remained on a steady upward path, led by stronger exports and improved domestic demand.",
        "One member expressed the view that, with the GDP gap turning positive, the economy had entered a fully-fledged expansionary phase.",
        "In this connection, most members noted that manufacturing production continued to rise and that exports maintained solidly-based growth with the turn for the better in external economic conditions.",
        "They also evaluated the recovery in the private sector, such as in facilities investment and consumption, as becoming more pronounced.",
        "However, some members commented that, taking into account the fact that services production had shifted to a decrease and that the index of leading economic indicators had posted a decline for the fifth consecutive month, economic uncertainties still existed, as before, and this needed to be monitored more cautiously.",
        "are posted in English on the Bank of Korea web site.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, most members forecasted that the economy would remain on the rise and that the trend of sound growth would continue.",
        "One member, meanwhile, anticipated that the growth rate would fall somewhat in the second half of the year, in reaction to the strong growth during the first half.",
        "With respect to employment, members considered the employment situation markedly improved, as shown by the sharp increase in the number of persons employed, particularly in the private sector.",
        "One member, however, pointed to the possibility of the trend of improvement being restricted from the second half onward, owing to restructuring in some industries and the termination of the government's public sector 'Hope and Work Project' job-creation program.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, some members pointed out that long-term market interest rates had risen considerably, reflecting the improved economic situation, although stock price and foreign exchange rate volatility had increased under the influence of destabilizing external factors.",
        "With regard to consumer price inflation, many members forecast that, although having remained in the mid-2% range during the first half, it would accelerate further, as demand-pull pressures would mount in accordance with the faster-than-expected economic recovery and rising cost-push pressures due to hikes in import prices and public utility charges.",
        "In particular, one member pointed out that attention needed to be paid to the fact that it usually took a long period of time for inflation expectations to stabilize once they had risen, due to their trait of persistence.",
        "In connection with the real estate market, some members mentioned that it remained sluggish, with housing sales prices falling at a faster pace in Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "One member meanwhile argued that the depressed real estate market in the Seoul metropolitan area had significantly raised delinquency rates at savings banks which had heavy exposure to project financing loans, that might damage their asset quality.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members agreed that a change in the monetary policy stance could not be postponed any longer, given the current situation in which the domestic economy continued on an upward track and inflationary pressures were mounting.",
        "Some pointed out the possibility that maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, set under the assumption of zero growth, could give rise, in a situation in which GDP was expected to grow at around 6% annually, to a number of economic distortions such as rises in asset prices and increases in leverage, along with delays in household and corporate restructuring and a consequent weakening of potential growth.",
        "Some members spoke of the need to secure the policy capacity to respond to a new economic shock, if the downside risks to growth should become acute.",
        "Some other members noted in addition that, given the time lag before interest rate policy had an effect, it was necessary to take preemptive monetary policy measures, as there was a possibility of consumer price inflation exceeding the 3% midpoint of the inflation target from the second half of the year.",
        "In particular, some among them pointed out that if the central bank missed the right timing, overheating of the economy and higher prices could appear, and this might increase the costs of raising interest rates, such as by requiring an expanded degree of policy rate adjustment.",
        "Other than that, an opinion was expressed that raising the Base Rate meant adjusting the degree of the accommodative policy stance step by step to bring it back to a neutral level, and would not mean a shifting of the monetary policy stance toward tightening.",
        "The opinion was also raised that the shock from the policy rate adjustment was unlikely to be grave, as market expectations of a policy rate increase had already formed to some degree.",
        "Another member, on the other hand, expressed the view that it was desirable to keep the accommodative monetary policy stance in place for the time being, given that prices were currently relatively stable, the real estate market was depressed, and the uncertainties surrounding the domestic and foreign economies were deepening.",
        "Prior to the members' arguments regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance present at the meeting, who explained the government's position on and assessment of the current economic situation and its view on mutual savings banks' handling of PF loans and corporate restructuring.",

        "- In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries such as the US have largely continued their recovery trend.",
        "The risks that international financial market unrest due to the government debt problems in some European countries and heightened volatility of growth in economic activity in major countries recur at any time cannot be ruled out.",
        "- The upward trend of domestic economic activity has been maintained.",
        "Exports have held to their strong upward track, domestic demand such as consumption and investment has steadily increased and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.",
        "Domestic economic activity is expected to continue on an upward track, even with the presence of overseas risk factors.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has so far remained in a range of somewhat above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upturn in economic activity.",
        "In the real estate market, housing sales prices have declined in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have sustained a highly upward trend.",

        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Many members evaluated the global economy as having generally kept up a moderate pace of recovery, with emerging countries continuing to lead the recovery and advanced economies also showing some improvements.",
        "Members’ assessment of the future outlook diverged, however ― with some members expressing skeptical views citing concerns about fiscal crisis in European countries, the high unemployment rate in the US and a fall in industrial production, while others anticipating that the additional quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve would reduce the risks of a double dip recession or deflation in the US economy.",
        "Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members' judgment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path, with daily average exports hitting a record high and consumption growing, although certain indicators including facilities investment had temporarily exhibited slowing rates of increase.",

        "Some members assessed the domestic financial markets as having remained stable overall, with foreign currency funding conditions appearing generally smooth, amid a declining exchange rate and rising stock prices due mostly to the sustained inflows of foreign investment funds.",

        "As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that the government saw prices as the most essential element for stability in the lives of ordinary people, and was consequently concentrating its efforts to contain concerns over price instability, by monitoring prices and improving its response systems, while focusing on early stabilization of the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products including vegetables.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister also revealed that active efforts were being made to formulate pre-emptive measures for coping with external factors causing uncertainty, including excessive capital inflows and offshore speculative transactions.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members agreed that it was necessary to raise the Base Rate, since the sustained economic upturn had caused a build-up of demand-pull pressures, while upside risk to the price path had expanded greatly with the run-up in commodity prices, the high price and wage growth in China, and the continuing expansion in global liquidity.",

        "One member mentioned that the GDP gap was estimated to be escaping its negative state.",
        "In this connection, most members noted that manufacturing and services production continued to rise and exports were also favorable, with export performance data on a daily basis hitting a record high in May, boosted by the global economic recovery.",
        "They pointed out in addition that the lackluster month-on-month performance of some domestic demand indicators such as facilities investment and consumption in the second quarter had been due to a technical base period effect following their large increases during the first quarter, and deemed overall domestic demand to still remain brisk.",
        "However, some members commented that, taking into account the fact are posted in English on the Bank of Korea web site.",
        "that growth in domestic demand was slowing and leading economic indicators were also continuing to decline, there was a likelihood of change in the phase of the business cycle and attention needed to be paid to this matter.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, many members forecasted that the trend of stable growth in Korea would not be under great threat during the second half of this year, although downside growth risk might increase to some extent in the case where the fiscal crises in some European countries caused increases in domestic and international financial market volatility.",
        "With respect to employment, members considered that the employment situation showed pronounced improvement, pointing to the examples of employment in the private sector returning to its pre-global financial crisis level in April and the sharp fall in the unemployment rate in May.",
        "One member, however, forecasted a somewhat limited recovery in the employment sector, noting the facts that restructuring of the small scale services industry, including the wholesale and retail and restaurants & hotels sectors, was continuing, and that the government's job creation schemes were being cut back or replaced by the end of June and the capacity to absorb young employees had weakened.",
        "Many members noted that the domestic financial markets had shown instability, as foreign portfolio investment funds had flown from the markets dramatically, and stock prices and the KRW/USD exchange rate had become much more volatile, influenced by the fiscal crises in some European countries and the growing geopolitical risk on the Korean peninsula.",
        "One member meanwhile assessed there to be great likelihood of distortions in market fund flows caused by herd behavior, since short-term funds were abundant in the financial markets, and he pointed to the need to step up monitoring of market fund flows.",
        "As to consumer price inflation, many members judged that, although it was below the inflation target, it was still higher than the expected level and there was a high possibility that it could exceed the target level at year-end, as consumer prices were rising gradually due to hikes in public utility charges and mounting demand-pull pressures in line with the economic recovery.",
        "One member noted that major indicators of demand-pull pressures, including the GDP gap rate, the manufacturing capacity utilization ratio and the employment rate, had already converged on or surpassed their long-term average figures.",

        "One member meanwhile argued that there were concerns about a possible vicious circle, in which the sluggish real estate market might worsen financial conditions in the construction industry, which would increase the delinquency rate of savings banks holding heavy project financing loans and damage their asset quality, consequently leading to a further increase in the downside pressures on real estate prices.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "Many members judged conditions to be have reached the stage where adjustment of the degree of monetary policy easing was appropriate, given the national economys having gotten back on track and the growing upside risks to prices.",
        "Some pointed out the possibility that maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, to which it had been steeply cut to counteract the crisis, might give rise to serious side effects such as herd behavior in the markets, adding that if this should undermine market confidence in the monetary authorities, they would have to shoulder a very heavy cost burden.",
        "Some members mentioned that it was advisable for the central bank to take preemptive monetary policy measures in an effort to mitigate potential inflationary pressures and prepare for new risks that might arise in the second half of the year.",
        "Some other members meanwhile argued that, given the relatively stable consumer prices, the central bank should wait and see how the global financial market unrest would progress before taking preemptive measures to adjust interest rates, since there was great uncertainty due to the fiscal problems in Southern European countries.",
        "Many members meanwhile noted that, even though not making an upward adjustment of the Base Rate this month, the central bank should send the markets a clearer signal of a possible interest rate increase than in the previous month, in order to prevent herd behavior.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that, although the fiscal crisis in Southern Europe was hardly likely to lead to a global financial crisis, reforms in the financial and foreign exchange markets should be energetically pursued now, so that the domestic economy would be able to cope with such crises in the future.",

        "Regarding the future outlook, most members raised concerns that the re-emergence of uncertainty in external conditions might be a downside risk factor to Korean economic growth.",
        "One member noted that attention needed to be paid to the downside risks arising from the scaling back of the government's support measures such as ending the tax breaks for passenger car purchases and the capital gains tax exemption on sales of houses.",
        "Meanwhile, there was another view that, as consumption and investment growth were expected to exceed their original forecasts along with the improved domestic and global conditions, the sign of self-sustained recovery in the private sector would become more evident, unless global economic conditions deteriorated sharply.",
        "Concerning production activities, members noted that, as demand recovered, manufacturing production increased at a faster pace and service production also swung back to an increase.",
        "With respect to employment, most members considered the Korean labor market was likely to remain subdued.",
        "And one member, in particular, claimed that the employment situation would stay far below the normal level for the time being, even if the government's job creation measures were again put in place.",
        "Most members commented that exports would continue to increase and facilities investment were also showing a gradual recovery.",
        "One member, however, mentioned that there was a high likelihood of export conditions might be significantly affected by the growing uncertainties concerning the KRW/USD exchange rate and the future directions of the Chinese economy.",

        "As for the domestic financial markets, most members noted that the volatility of stock prices and KRW/USD exchange rate had risen, affected by external risk factors.",
        "One member mentioned, however, that market interest rates had remained stable, which may be due to market participants' weakened expectations of an upward policy rate adjustment.",
        "Meanwhile, another member emphasized that attention should be given to the possibility that there might arise doubts on the reliability and effectiveness of monetary policy if the gap between short and long-term interest rates, which had widened substantially of late, persisted for a long time.",
        "Although members agreed that the corporate and household sectors are financially in good shape overall, some pointed out the likelihood that the ending of the government's financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and banks' strengthening of risk management might aggravate funding conditions for SMEs with poor credit ratings.",

        "Many members shared the view that domestic demand including private consumption and investment was showing gradual improvement.",
        "However, one member suggested that there was a possibility of a contraction in domestic facilities investment and construction investment, resulting from a decline in foreign direct investment and the lackluster real estate market, and that consumption was also unlikely to show much improvement because households' burden of principal and interest repayment had increased with their growing debt levels.",
        "As for the domestic financial markets, the majority of members noted that stock prices had risen and the KRW/USD exchange rate had declined, influenced by an expansion of foreign portfolio investment fund inflows.",

        "With regard to prices, a number of members anticipated that the rise in the consumer price index would accelerate, as pressures on the demand side would mount with the economic recovery in the second half of this year and pressures on the supply side, such as from the run-up in global commodity prices, would also build.",

        "Many members commented that the pace and scale of monetary policy easing should be adjusted appropriately before the prolongation of the current low interest rate stance brought about economically harmful consequences, including delays in corporate and household restructuring, growing indebtedness, expansions in speculative investment / consumption, etc.",
        "Some members mentioned that a signal of early normalization, to some degree, of the Bank of Korea Base Rate should be sent to the financial markets to help to form rational market expectations, as the wide-spread perception of financial market participants that the current monetary policy stance would be maintained for a long time would lead to a growing possibility of economic instability arising from distortions in market fund flows.",
        "Other members, however, said that caution was needed in shifting the policy stance dramatically, citing as grounds that uncertainties still surrounded domestic and overseas economic conditions, that the low-interest rate policy had not caused pronounced economic imbalances so far, and that the predominant opinion among financial market participants was that the Bank of Korea Base Rate would be held at its current level for the time being.",

        "Some members pointed out that the previous month's upward adjustment had been the first in 17 months, and that if a further rise were made the following month in succession, this fast pace of increase might shock the market, regardless of the size of adjustment.",
        "In particular, one member suggested that attention needed to be paid to the possibility that consecutive upward adjustments might lead to unexpected side effects, sparking concerns of a drastic correction in the housing market, which had recently shown sustained downward movements, and dampening economic agents' sentiment severely.",

        "Some members, however, judged that uncertainties still existed in the economy, pointing to examples of leading economic indicators staying on a downward track for the third consecutive month and to the possibility of higher volatility in the global financial market impacted by the fiscal problems in Southern European countries.",
        "Concerning production activities, members commented that most production indexes had exhibited recoveries.",
        "With respect to employment, many members considered that the employment situation had shown gradual improvement, but one member forecasted that it would take a considerable period of time for the employment situation to get back to its normal level, as employment in the private sector had not shown any evident improvement due to the weakened capacity of the service sector to absorb employees.",

        "Concerning the domestic financial markets, many members noted that the movements of price variables like stock prices, interest rates and exchange rates, had shown increased instability, as flows of foreign investment capital were becoming more volatile affected by the fiscal crisis in Southern European countries and the possibility of appreciation of the Chinese yuan.",

        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions related to changing the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members mentioned that, although Korea had been showing the fastest economic recovery among OECD member countries, and its major economic indicators, including economic growth, had therefore returned to their pre-global financial crisis period levels, the normalization of interest rates had been pushed back owing to the uncertainty surrounding external conditions.",
        "They agreed that, since the jitters in the financial and foreign exchange markets caused by sovereign debt problems in Southern European countries had not eased sufficiently this month, it was necessary to wait for the time being and see how the issue would be resolved.",

        "They expressed the view that a signal of a possible upward policy rate adjustment should be sent to the financial markets this month, to change the unilateral market expectations that the Bank of Korea Base Rate would remain unchanged at its current level for a considerable time.",
        "One member said that the costs incurred from economic imbalances resulting from a delay in lifting the rate could far outweigh the costs from a renewed economic contraction caused by the upward rate adjustment, and said it was also needed to secure policy capacity in advance, when the economic situation was better, to brace for the possibility of a re-emerging economic slowdown caused by the spread of global financial market unrest in the future.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, as financial market volatilities would occur naturally in the process of resolving the global financial crisis, such risks should be accepted somewhat, and should moreover be utilized as opportunities to strengthen the Korean economic fundamentals.",
        "Meanwhile, some members emphasized that, although prices were relatively stable, the real estate market was in a recession and the uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas financial markets were increasing.",

        "Some members pointed out that the recent sharp drop in long- and short-term interest rates was attributable to market participants' weakened expectations of an upward policy rate adjustment, together with massive foreign capital inflows to the bond market which had brought about a significant decline in yields on corporate and other credit bonds.",

        "One member judged that adverse side effects of the accommodative macro policy, such as a growing risk of household and corporate loan insolvencies were gradually emerging, as the prolonged period of low interest rate policy had led to more relaxed perceptions of and attitudes toward risk on the parts of economic agents.",

        "It is anticipated to be stable for some time given the recent movements of international raw material prices.",
        "In the real estate market, transactions have remained inactive even though prices have risen moderately.",
        "- In the financial markets, stock prices have rebounded and the Korean won has appreciated in line with alleviation of international financial market unrest, such as the government debt crises in some european countries.",
        "Mortgage lending has increased slightly due to seasonal factors.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity.",
        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Many members commented that, although the global economy remained generally on a track of recovery, uncertainty about world economic conditions was still high, as the central banks of major advanced countries were expanding quantitative easing in response to the slowdown of economic recovery.",
        "Some pointed out that a sharp conflict over exchange rates between major advanced countries and emerging countries could act as a new risk factor for the global economy.",
        "Concerning recent domestic economic developments, most members' assessment was that the domestic economy remained on an upward path, led by strong exports and improvements in domestic demand including consumption and facilities investment.",
        "However, some members assessed the growth momentum to be weakening to some extent, as production activities in manufacturing and service industries showed signs of flattening out and the coincident composite index shifted to a decrease.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic economy would remain on an upward track, while pointing out that concern still existed that a slower recovery in the global economy, high exchange rate volatility, and a sharp run-up in global commodity prices might act as downside risk factors for its growth path.",
        "With respect to employment, some members evaluated the employment situation as continuing to improve, with the number of persons employed in the private sector having shown a month-on-month increase of 20,000 in August.",
        "Some members assessed the domestic financial markets as having remained stable, with sustained inflows of foreign investment funds causing a fall in bond rates and a rise in stock prices, while the foreign currency funding situation appeared generally smooth.",
        "Many members pointed out that consumer price inflation in September stood above the midpoint of the intermediate inflation target at 3.6%, affected by the soaring prices of vegetables and other agricultural products resulting from unusual weather conditions.",
        "Some forecasted that, considering the likelihood of mounting demand-pull pressures exerted by the economic upturn, and of hikes in global commodity prices and public utility charges, consumer prices would show a rapid rate of increase going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, other members mentioned that, with core inflation remaining low at under 2%, if the authorities strive to control inflation expectations from rising and to stabilize short-term supply and demand of agricultural products, then the likelihood of an overall rise in the price level could be minimized.",
        "As to the real estate market, most members noted that housing prices had continued to fall in Seoul and its surrounding areas while continuing to rise in the provinces, and that leasehold deposits were on the rise nationwide.",
        "Prior to the members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, who explained the government's assessment of the current economic situation, the trend and outlook for prices, foreign capital investment trends and so on, and then left the meeting.",
        "With regard to the recent economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister assessed the economy as basically continuing its recovery, and attributed some poor showing of a few real economic indicators to temporary factors.",
        "He pointed out that some new external factors making for uncertainty were emerging, however, including the intensification of disputes among countries over exchange rates and signs of a renewed run-up in global grain prices.",
        "As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that a number of short- and long-term schemes to stabilize supply and demand would be drawn up and put into place, given the recent rise in prices due to supply-demand factors including the vegetable price hikes stemming from unseasonable temperatures.",
        "He anticipated, however, that even if vegetable prices might well stabilize in a short time, the general price level was expected to be somewhat high in the coming months, influenced by a base period effect and so on.",
        "Meanwhile, with regard to foreign investment capital, the 1st Vice Minister said that, since inflows of foreign capital might accelerate in the event of additional liquidity supply by major advanced countries, their trends should be closely monitored and countermeasures against them would be taken if needed.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members agreed that, although the Base Rate needed to be restored to a normal level before long, in view of the high economic growth and inflation rates, it should be left at its current level this month considering that economic uncertainty at home and abroad remained high and that tension between countries over foreign exchange rates had recently been escalating further.",
        "In particular, one member expressed the opinion that a rise in the Base Rate could widen the gap between domestic and overseas interest rates and accelerate capital inflows, leading to a sharp fall in exchange rates.",
        "This might then gravely undermine exports.",
        "One member argued, however, in view of the abundant international liquidity, that even keeping the Base Rate on hold might not lead to a reduction in foreign investment fund inflows or the disappearance of downward pressure on exchange rates.",
        "He added that, on the contrary, the danger of policy failure might be increased because of the inadequate preemptive policy response to inflation risks.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, members agreed by majority vote to hold the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level.",
        "However, Mr. Choi, Dosoung clearly dissented from this decision and argued that the Base Rate should be raised by 0.25%p.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period.",
        "- In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their moderate recovery trend, even though the pace of the recovery in the US economy has slowed somewhat.",
        "Looking ahead, there exists the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic activity and exchange rates in major countries acting as a risk factor for the global economy.",
        "- The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained.",
        "Even though consumption has faltered, exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has increased.",
        "And, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend.",
        "The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying upward track, even in the presence of external risk.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has increased due to a sudden rise in farm product prices, and in the future, upward pressures on the demand side are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in activity.",
        "In the real estate market, housing sales prices have continued to decline in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have maintained their increase.",
        "- In the financial markets, stock prices have risen, the Korean won has appreciated, and market interest rates have declined in response chiefly to the expanded inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds.",
        "The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened due to the increase in the numbers of newly occupied apartments, even though house transactions have been inactive.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth under the accommodative policy stance.",
        "In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Domestic and Overseas Economic Developments' and on 'Financial Markets', the Monetary Policy Committee With regard to the global economy, most members agreed that there still existed a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the global financial markets, including the possibility of commercial real estate loan defaults in advanced countries and the possibility of credit rating downgradings of some heavily-indebted countries in the euro zone.",
        "Particularly, one member expressed the view that, even though global economic recovery was expected to become more evident, advanced markets might not get back on track in a short time owing to delays in improvement in the employment conditions, to weakened policy effects, to persistent large fiscal deficits, etc.",
        "Another member meanwhile argued that the possibility of global economic recovery was also gradually increasing, thanks to the signs of improvement in U.S. employment and housing indexes, which had until then been a source of deep concern.",
        "As for recent domestic economic developments, members estimated that, following the strong growth seen during the second and third quarters, the Korean economy remained on an upward track to show slightly positive growth in the fourth quarter, boosted by the steady improvements of exports and domestic demand.",
        "One member voiced the opinion that, during the course of the global financial crisis, unlike advanced countries which increased their fiscal spending mainly directed toward the financial sector for bailouts, the Korean government had directed it toward current and capital expenditures.",
        "This contributed to an increase in aggregate demand, and as a result Korea has shown the fastest economic growth among all OECD members.",
        "In particular, the member noted that the increasing of tax benefits available on the Bank of Korea web site.",
        "related to purchases of housing and automobiles, sectors which have high economic volatility, was seen to have kept the economy from shrinking dramatically.",
        "Meanwhile, some members expressed the view that the recent continued growth was attributable to the completion of inventory adjustments and to the increased demand for new cars boosted by the system of tax incentives for scrapping old models, which made the recent growth somewhat far from an endogenous recovery of growth momentum driven by the private sector.",
        "One member pointed out that general public business sentiment had not improved much due to the sluggish employment situation.",
        "With regard to the current account, one member expected it to remain in surplus, but on a substantially reduced scale owing to an increase in imports drawn in by the domestic economic recovery and to a decrease in the KRW/USD exchange rate.",
        "As to the future outlook, many members expected the domestic economy would grow even faster, boosted by the rise in consumer and investor sentiment and improvement in the global economic climate along with the continued expansionary macro-economic policy stance.",
        "However, one member pointed out the possibility that the degree of contribution of fiscal stimulus to growth might fall greatly from the second half of the year, since it would be difficult for the government to expand its spending significantly this year due to concerns about fiscal soundness.",
        "Another member pointed out that with the delayed recoveries of the U.S. and other advanced economies, a hike in global oil prices and household loan defaults might have a negative effect on the domestic economic recovery.",
        "Another member anticipated that the private sector would not show strong growth momentum for the time being, owing to the stubbornly sluggish employment conditions and to a base-period effect from the increased demand for automobiles last year.",
        "With regard to production activities, many members commented that production remained on the rise, a trend attributable to steady growth in exports and to a sustained, although limited, increase in private consumption.",
        "Particularly, one member suggested that the recent slowdown in the speed of production growth was attributable to the base-period effect from the rapid recovery from the second quarter of the previous year, and that it had been somewhat expected.",
        "As to employment, some members mentioned that, although the domestic economic recovery was gathering pace, the employment situation in Korea remained sluggish owing to the rise in the share in the economy of the IT-manufacturing sector with its relatively weak job creation effect.",
        "One member expected that the employment situation would not improve for the time being, due to the government's scaling down of its employment support measures and to its promotion of corporate restructuring.",
        "One member expressed the view that the recent increase in facilities investment was attributable to replacement investment, such as for the trading in old cars, and that this might only have a limited effect on enhancing the growth potential of the domestic economy.",
        "The member added that, since the growth potential of the Korean economy would inevitably weaken if the facilities investment and employment situations - key elements of growth potential - remained sluggish for a longer period of time, policy efforts are needed to remove structural obstacles restricting facilities investment.",
        "He also said that not only expansionary macro-economic policy measures but also micro-economic policy efforts were required to improve the employment situation.",
        "Meanwhile, most members agreed that the recent hike in long- and short-term market interest rates and stock prices was attributable to stronger expectations of economic recovery.",
        "One member suggested the view that, since a rise in long- and short-term market interest rates led to a widening gap between these rates and the policy rate, and consequently weakening the Base Rate's effectiveness as a policy rate, at the time of policy rate determination, consideration should be given to the fact that expectations of an early upward policy rate adjustment are not yet clear in the market.",
        "Some members mentioned that, despite the Kumho Group's filing for a debt workout, corporate and household fund-raising was proceeding smoothly.",
        "One member pointed out that, despite the strengthened debt-to-income regulations, the number of home mortgages taken out was accelerating led by group mortgages.",
        "A different member suggested the view that uncertainties associated with loan-to-deposit regulations might increase, as substantial changes were expected to take place in banks' fund-raising and fund operation.",
        "The member added that interest rates might rise and the burden of principal and interest repayment might accordingly increase in the near future, which would very likely lead to bankruptcies of households with heavy debt burdens and limit the recovery of consumption.",
        "Another member said that, since financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises would decrease from this year onward, while there was also a possibility of further corporate restructuring being carried out, closer examination of the funding conditions of these enterprises was needed.",
        "With regard to prices, most members anticipated that the consumer price index would accelerate temporarily in January, influenced by a global oil price rise, but then decelerate to its previous level for the time being in line with the sluggish job market and an easing of demand side pressures.",
        "One member commented that attention needed to be paid to the growing possibility of higher uncertainty surrounding prices engendered by the recent exchange rate.",
        "A different member expressed the view that pressure on the demand side would gradually mount, as the negative output gap would almost diminish from a mid-term perspective.",
        "Most members shared the view that real estate prices would remain stable for the time being, with the upward trend slowing due to the imposition of stricter loan regulations.",
        "They expressed the opinion, however, that, given supply and demand factors such as the fall in supply of houses available and the rise in demand in line with economic recovery, there was a possibility that housing prices would show instability.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.",
        "Most members agreed that the main tasks of this year's monetary policy were to adjust the pace and scale of monetary policy easing appropriately, in order to help sustain the economic recovery as well as to avoid economic imbalances.",
        "They shared the view especially that strong efforts were needed to choose the timing of policy adjustment.",
        "One member, in particular, mentioned that there should be extensive discussion as to whether the current Base Rate level of 2%, at which it had been maintained in response to negative and zero growth, was appropriate for an economic environment in which five percent GDP growth is anticipated.",
        "Despite this gradually growing necessity to raise the Base Rate level, however, the monetary policy direction should, for the time being, be determined based upon consideration of the economically harmful effects arising from sustained low-interest rates and the risk of economic downturn resulting from normalization of the interest rate level.",
        "With this view in mind, most members agreed that the current economic recovery was not yet solid enough to allow an immediate shift in the policy stance.",
        "Meanwhile, one member noted that, with the easing of the recent global financial crunch, global money was flowing rapidly into emerging markets, which showed relatively robust economic recoveries, and requested a proper response to the massive influx of foreign portfolio investment funds into Korea which started last year.",
        "With regard to this issue, some members said that it was necessary to closely monitor the foreign exchange market, whose volatility had increased greatly recently.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, all members agreed on maintaining the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and passed a resolution to this effect[3)].",
        "The remarks of the senior minister of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance present at the meeting[4)] were as follows : Committee is firmly established, in terms of system and practice, and that it is time for the government and the central bank to undertake constructive policy cooperation.",
        "Against this backdrop, it is important for a government representative to attend meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee, the top decision - making body on monetary policy in Korea, in order to strengthen policy cooperation.",
        "strengthened economic fundamentals and the crisis response measures, the economy is recovering rapidly and showing stability in terms of the financial markets and the external sector.",
        "However, it is still hard to take an optimistic view on the economy since some uncertainties still persist, such as the delay in recovery of the global economy and the upward movement of oil prices.",
        "In addition, the private sector - for example, consumption and investment does not have sufficient endogenous economic resilience to recover, and the improvement in employment conditions had been unsatisfactory.",
        "Based upon this understanding, the government plans to come up with measures that focus on successfully overcoming the crisis and laying the foundation for growth.",
        "For that reason, it plans to make efforts to boost structural reforms and expand growth potential by setting job creation as the top priority of this year's economic policy, while maintaining an expansionary macro policy stance for the time being.",
        "In addition, the government sees it as necessary to thoroughly examine the risk factors of the Korean economy and respond to them preemptively.",
        "In this regard, it plans to reduce the risks arising from changes in the interest the Bank of Korea's Monetary Policy Committee.",
        "rate burden by inducing a diversification of benchmark rates for mortgage loans and increasing the proportion of long-term fixed rate home loans.",
        "Furthermore, the government will do its utmost to respond preemptively to risk factors by closely monitoring the global financial markets, global money flows, and asset price movements, all of which have recently shown widening fluctuations.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend, which is expected to be maintained.",
        "Exports and domestic demand have continued to increase thanks to the progress of the global economic situation.",
        "There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the risk of delay in a full-fledged recovery of the major advanced economies.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has accelerated its rising pace, led by petroleum products and is anticipated to be further heightened temporarily by the influence of the heavy snowfalls.",
        "The upward trend of real estate prices has slowed.",
        "- In the financial markets, long-term and short-term market interest rates and stock prices have shown a sharp run-up in line with the improvements in economic activity.",
        "Mortgage lending has grown on a steady scale.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity."

    "2019": [
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook for 2019 (revised),[2)]_ _FX and International_ members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that the pace of global economic growth had continued to slow and that the rate of global trade growth had declined, affected largely by the US-China trade dispute.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members judged that volatility of price variables, such as interest rates in major countries, had increased temporarily but then stabilized with risk-off sentiment easing in accordance chiefly with a reduction in major country policy uncertainties.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that private consumption growth had slowed and exports and facilities investment had been also sluggish, particularly in the semiconductor and other IT sectors.",
        "The members forecast that, although the economic outlook for this year had been adjusted slightly downward with first-quarter growth more sluggish than originally expected, the growth momentum would improve going forward as the effects of expansionary fiscal policy gradually increased and semiconductor demand picked up.",
        "Meanwhile, some of the members took the view that, despite the recent downward adjustment to the economic outlook, the downside risks seemed to outweigh the upside risks.",
        "Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had declined substantially due to supply-side factors, including the government’s stronger social-welfare policy and declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, amid modest demand-side pressures.",
        "However, members expected inflation to show modest growth going forward, affected largely by increases in some public utility charges.",
        "Meanwhile, the majority of members stressed the importance of the anchoring of inflation expectations, and expressed the view that it would be necessary to closely analyze the recent low inflation and focus on communication concerning underlying inflation.",
        "Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members assessed them to have stabilized overall, although the volatility of price variables, such as long-term interest rates, had expanded somewhat.",
        "Members also noted that growth in household lending had continued to slow, influenced by strengthened micro-level regulations and the reduced degree of monetary easing.",
        "However, the majority of members emphasized the need to keep a close watch on financial imbalances, which remained at a high level.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member stated that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and take time to examine whether the global economy, including the US economy, would rebound, while also watching the trends of the domestic economy, employment, household debt and the real estate market.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the global economy had exhibited slower growth than originally forecast in January and that this trend could continue for some time.",
        "The member noted that the US economy, in particular, had been slowing overall and it would be necessary to closely examine the extent to which the economy would rebound from the second quarter.",
        "In the global financial markets, stock prices had been rising since the beginning of April and currencies of emerging market countries, except for some vulnerable countries, had exhibited stable movements.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member forecast that government spending would maintain strong growth, but the growth of private consumption would become modest, facilities and construction investment would continue to undergo corrections, and exports would grow more slowly than a year earlier.",
        "The member expressed particular concern that exports and facilities investment had remained sluggish, particularly in the semiconductor sector.",
        "The member expected exports and facilities investment to start to pick up from the second half with the semiconductor industry improving gradually, but the pace of recovery in facilities investment to be slower than originally forecast.",
        "Looking at employment, which had been recently recovering somewhat, the member noted that employment in the services sector was anticipated to improve, while that in the manufacturing sector was forecast to remain lackluster for the time being, and careful monitoring was required in this regard.",
        "The member took the view that, although a supplementary budget that the government had been working on would make up for the sluggishness of the domestic economy to a certain extent, the domestic economy would not be able to avoid the effects of the global economic slowdown.",
        "However, the member also forecast that, if concerns about external destabilizing factors, such as the US-China trade dispute, were resolved, this could work as an upside risk to economic growth in the second half.",
        "The member took the view that outlook for consumer price inflation this year had been adjusted downward to a larger extent from the January forecast, and that the current monetary easing stance should be maintained since demand-side inflation pressures were unlikely to be large going forward.",
        "The member’s assessment of financial stability was positive.",
        "The member evaluated that the stock market had remained bullish and the supply of funding to the corporate sector had been seamless amid a favorable credit market.",
        "The member added that household debt had remained stable thanks largely to strong government measures.",
        "However, the member stressed the need to continuously examine the trends of household debt and the real estate market to determine whether concerns regarding financial imbalances would be clearly resolved.",
        "Finally, the member mentioned that after the March FOMC meeting the market had expected the US Federal Reserve not to raise its policy rate for the time being, but some forecast the Fed to make further rate hikes next year if the US economy picked up in the second half of this year and inflation neared its target.",
        "In light of this, the member noted that it would be necessary to thoroughly analyze the US economy and financial market.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting, since inflation had continued to slow and the domestic and overseas economic slowdowns had been becoming more evident amid sluggish global trade.",
        "With respect to the real economy, the member judged that the domestic economy had been slowing more rapidly than expected, as on the external side the global economy had continued to decelerate and on the domestic side there was a correction in facilities investment, driven by external factors, as well as signs of a slowdown in private consumption.",
        "The member pointed out that global trade-related indicators directly affecting the domestic economy had been plunging recently, while the outlook for modest slowdown of US economic growth had strengthened.",
        "The member went on to state that it would be necessary to keep an eye on whether the sluggishness of global trade would be temporary.",
        "The member assessed that facilities investment had been shrinking further than expected due to the overall sluggishness of exports centering around the IT sector, and that private consumption growth had continued to slow since the second half of last year with households’ propensities for consumption failing to maintain recovery.",
        "The member noted that the Bank of Korea Research Department had adjusted its growth forecast slightly downward from 2.6 percent to 2.5 percent in expectation of a recovery in the growth rate from the second quarter, but whether this expectation would actually materialize was substantially uncertain.",
        "The member added that there remained some downside risks to the inflation forecast as well, given the real economic and inflation trends.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that core inflation had remained in the lower-1 percent range for a long period of time, and this sluggishness or gradual decline in inflation was likely to continue rather than be resolved this year, which was a matter of concern to the monetary policy authorities.",
        "The member took the view that, from a long-term perspective, inflation had started to decline in around 2012 and, in statistical terms, this was explained substantially by the decline in underlying inflation resulting mainly from global factors such as oil prices.",
        "However, the member also argued that attention should be paid to the increasing role of domestic factors in recent times, including service charges.",
        "The member expressed the view that the decline in inflation caused by domestic factors could and must be managed by active policy responses, and stressed that long-lasting low inflation could cause inflation expectations to decline.",
        "The member added that, if inflation expectations declined to the 1 percent level, the current Base Rate level would likely become similar to or higher than the neutral interest rate, and argued that attention should be paid to changes in inflation expectations as they could directly affect the degree of monetary easing even if the Base Rate remained unchanged.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to resolve to some extent the accumulated upward pressures on administered prices so that the overall inflation rate could increase to near its target this year.",
        "On the other hand, the member stated that, considering the low inflation trends and the gradual decline in the real neutral interest rate resulting mainly from population aging, the gap between the Base Rate and the neutral interest rate was narrowing rapidly, and that, in light of this, further rate hikes were not likely to become the future direction of monetary policy.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the member’s evaluation was that some changes were witnessed to the previous year’s trend of household debt growth being led by leasehold deposit loans and credit loans extended by banks.",
        "The member added that leasehold deposit loans continued to be extended briskly but their growth rate showed signs of stagnating and growth in credit loans had reversed to a decrease in the first quarter this year, and went on to state that, if growth in leasehold deposit loans continued to be curbed, the overall rate of household debt growth would likely continue to decline gradually.",
        "One other member took the view that, considering inflation and financial stability conditions and the government’s expansionary policy stance, it would be important to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance to anchor inflation expectations and curb the widening of financial imbalances, and that in light of this it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The member evaluated that consumer price inflation had recently stood at the mid-0 percent level, but underlying inflation had held steady when accounting for the trends of sticky prices and prices of items sensitive to business cycles.",
        "However, the member also expressed the view that, as some indicators of inflation expectations had been weakening, it would be necessary to adopt a mix of macroeconomic policies reflecting the following points so that low consumer price inflation would not be prolonged.",
        "First, the member stressed the importance of an accurate understanding of the current inflation trend.",
        "The member argued that an appropriate strategy was needed to anchor inflation expectations, as the sustained low consumer price inflation appeared to have stemmed substantially from administered prices as well as global and structural factors.",
        "Second, the member argued that it would be necessary to rethink the causes underlying the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "The member stated that financial imbalances seemed to have worsened in Korea due to increased leverage amid a weakened virtuous circle of the economy, and that attention should be paid to the possibility that, if demand is stimulated through monetary policy alone without fundamental problems being resolved, the buildup of financial imbalances, along with inflation, could accelerate in another way.",
        "The member also took the view that debt growth and inefficient investment could ultimately act as downward pressures on growth and inflation and, in this regard, it would be necessary to examine policy effects over a more medium-term horizon.",
        "Third, the member stressed the need to look at the cases of advanced countries experiencing difficulties on the inflation front.",
        "The member stated that, since the global financial crisis, Europe and Japan had strengthened communication based largely on negative interest rates and quantitative easing, but inflation in these regions had continued to fall short of targets for more than a decade, suggesting that there might have been changes in the dynamics among interest rates, currencies, liquidity and asset prices.",
        "Finally, the member predicted that the volume of tax revenues would correspond with the budget and that fiscal policy would shift to a very expansionary stance.",
        "With the aforementioned matters taken into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member expected that the sustained accommodative stance, combined with the expansionary fiscal policy, would contribute to driving demand-side pressures and maintaining inflation expectations.",
        "The member also suggested that monetary policy could create a stable environment in which consumption and investment would be based on economic fundamentals, consequently curbing the widening of financial imbalances, and that fiscal policy could have stronger effects by selectively supporting specific areas.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed this policy mix as appropriate in terms of macroeconomic balance, as an expansion of Treasury bond issuance was unlikely to weigh on the market and fiscal policy-led stimulation of demand could narrow the current account surplus, reducing excessive upward pressures on the Korean won.",
        "One member, meanwhile, noted that, given the current macroeconomic conditions, the possibility of marked improvement in the slowdowns of economic activity and prices was not high.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that it was necessary to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level at the present meeting, while paying more attention to buffering against downside risks to the macroeconomy in the conduct of monetary policy going forward.",
        "Concerning the recent Korean economy, the member’s assessment was that the buoyancy seen for the last two years in the semiconductor sector had ended, resulting in an overall weakening of macroeconomic indicators.",
        "The member first saw that export growth, which had been heavily dependent upon the semiconductor industry, was declining significantly, and the decrease in facilities investment had become more pronounced, led by the IT sector.",
        "The member added that private consumption, which had shown relatively favorable movements, had been slowing since the second half of last year, accompanied by an overall contraction in the macroeconomy.",
        "The member noted that the government’s active fiscal policy alone was serving as a buffer against a contraction in private-sector economic activity.",
        "The member’s assessment was that consumer price inflation had sharply slowed to the mid-0 percent range in the first quarter, due to declines in oil prices and agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had declined to around 1 percent, sustaining the downward trend seen since impacts on the economic recovery, by working to increase actual interest burdens.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, although there were both upside and downside risks to the future outlook, it was not easy to expect tangible reversals of the current slowdowns of economic activity and prices.",
        "As positive points, the member mentioned the relative stability of international financial markets, thanks for instance to changes in the monetary policy stances of major advanced economies, and the increasing possibility of an agreement in the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the ongoing decline in trade growth stemming from the slowdown in the world economy would weigh on the Korean economy.",
        "The member also presented the view that, although the declining demand for semiconductors seen since the fourth quarter of last year had eased of late, it would be difficult to expect that last year’s unprecedented buoyancy of the semiconductor sector would return.",
        "The member expressed the view that, on the domestic front, slowdowns in household debt growth and the housing market were highly likely to continue due to the implementation of strong macroprudential policy.",
        "The member thought that fiscal policy could be expected to have some degree of counter-cyclical buffer effects, as the government was pursuing a large fiscal expansion.",
        "Another member noted that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level, since financial conditions remained accommodative and there still were concerns about financial imbalances, despite downward adjustments to the growth and inflation outlooks.",
        "The member noted that the 2019 GDP growth outlook by the Bank of Korea Research Department had been revised slightly downward from the January forecast, which appeared to reflect more-sluggish-than-expected exports and facilities investment.",
        "The member saw that weaker global growth and a contraction in global trade, stemming for instance from the US-China trade conflict, and a slowdown in the semiconductor industry had exerted huge negative impacts on the Korean economy, which was heavily dependent upon semiconductor exports and the Chinese economy.",
        "The member, however, noted that the possibility had increased of some form of agreement being reached in the US-China trade negotiations, that many experts were forecasting a recovery in the semiconductor sector from the second half onward, and that the effects from an expansionary fiscal policy were expected to increase gradually.",
        "Given these points, the member projected the growth momentum to improve going forward.",
        "As a result, the member expected the Korean economy to show a trend of growth, not greatly deviating from its potential rate, again in the second half of this year and next year.",
        "With respect to inflation, the member commented that the outlook for consumer price inflation for this year was revised downward to 1.1 percent, which appeared to be attributable to an increase in downward inflationary pressures stemming from non-cyclical factors, such as lower prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and the government’s stronger social-welfare policy.",
        "The member expected inflation to increase, albeit modestly, due mainly to rises in some public utility fees going forward.",
        "The member, however, saw that, given structural downside risks to prices, such as population aging, globalization, and innovations in distribution, inflation could run below its target for a considerable time.",
        "The member noted that such persistent low inflation was observed commonly in most major countries, and for central banks adopting inflation targeting, this added to the difficulties in monetary policy operation and public communication.",
        "The member commented that, particularly since the Bank of Korea had decided to strengthen its responsibilities of explaining inflation assessment to the public, by for instance regularly publishing a report reviewing its operation of the inflation targeting starting from this year, every effort should be made in this regard.",
        "Last, the member found financial conditions to remain accommodative, in overall consideration of major price variables in the financial markets and of credit and liquidity conditions.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that it was necessary to keep in mind that there still were great concerns about the household debt level, a major risk to financial stability.",
        "Another member noted that, given recent developments in the policies of major countries and financial conditions, the growth slowdowns of the domestic and global economies were not expected to deepen further from the second quarter onward, while financial imbalances in the domestic economy were still high.",
        "The member thus presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate on hold at the present meeting, while closely monitoring overall macroeconomic and financial market conditions for the time being.",
        "The member expressed the view that global growth had continued to slow, with the pace of slowdown estimated to have been deeper than previously expected in the first quarter.",
        "Yet, given that policies in major countries and financial conditions had been moving in relatively favorable directions, the member noted that the global growth slowdown was more likely to stabilize eventually, if not rebound, than lead to a full-fledged downturn phase.",
        "The member commented that the reduced uncertainty about major country policies had been easing global financial conditions via the retreat of risk aversion, which in turn could work in favor of policy flexibility of the countries where external conditions were not considered sound.",
        "The member also noted that some survey indicators had been showing signs of improvement of late.",
        "The member saw these changes as positive, but pointed out that, since the US-China trade negotiations had not yet been finalized and global manufacturing and investment still remained sluggish, it was necessary to constantly keep an eye on the relevant developments.",
        "The member added that major countries’ policy responses were focusing on short-term stimulus measures, not structural improvements, and thus uncertainties surrounding the medium- to long-term growth path still remained high.",
        "The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that there had been ongoing concerns about a possible domestic economic downturn, as a global economic slowdown had been underway, led by industries upon which Korean exports heavily rely on.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although growth in the first quarter was estimated to have slowed significantly, sluggishness in some indicators, including export and employment indexes, had been moderating from the middle of the first quarter onward when controlling for seasonal and irregular factors, and the growth contribution of fiscal expenditures had been rising further.",
        "The member, however, added that it was necessary to take some time to monitor whether these movements would lead to a meaningful rebound.",
        "The member saw consumer inflation as likely to remain muted throughout the first half of this year, due to the base effect from last year.",
        "The member, however, expected it to pick up from the second half onward, given recent movements of prices of oil and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and planned hikes to public utility fees.",
        "The member also noted that the rate of increase in the business cycle-sensitive price index and the rate of inflation expected by the general public had been stable.",
        "The member noted that, on the financial stability side, risk from the buildup of financial imbalances had been easing gradually, due to an ongoing slowdown in growth of household lending and real estate-related lending, but the level of financial imbalances was still high.",
        "The member emphasized the need for keeping a constant eye on the relevant developments, in consideration of the volumes of apartments allotted and newly built this year in the Seoul Capital area.",
        "The member saw that, although domestic and international financial markets had been stable since the beginning of this year, there still were concerns about economic conditions and uncertainties surrounding policies of major countries.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that attention should be paid to the possibility of increased market volatility.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved unanimously by the members.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision `□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets increased temporarily.",
        "Government bond yields in major countries have fallen considerably, in line mainly with concerns about the global economic slowdown and changes in expectations about the monetary policies of such countries, while the exchange rates of some vulnerable emerging economies have risen significantly.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit.",
        "`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has moderated somewhat as consumption growth has temporarily slowed, facilities and construction investment have continued undergoing adjustments and export growth has continued to slow.",
        "The sluggishness in employment conditions has partially lessened, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "Going forward the Board expects that consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually toward the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue.",
        "GDP is forecast to grow at the mid-2% level this year, slightly below the level projected in January (2.6%).",
        "`□` Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the low- to mid-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below the second half of this year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "`□` The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has expanded slightly.",
        "Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have rebounded after having fallen, affected by movements in the global financial markets in line with projections of weakening growth in major countries and expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation.",
        "After briefings by staff on “Recent Economic Developments,”[2)] “FX and International Finance Trends,” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that there were somewhat growing concerns about slower global growth, particularly in the euro area and China.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members mentioned that volatility had continued to decrease, due to eased risk aversion stemming for instance from lowered expectations of additional rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the adjustments in facilities and construction investment had continued, exports had seen a greater decline, and employment conditions in the private sector had continued to be sluggish.",
        "Members, however, expected economic growth not to diverge significantly from its potential level, as private consumption had continued to grow modestly and fiscal spending had served as a buffer against the risk of a rapid slowdown.",
        "Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had declined sharply, due mainly to a decline in petroleum product prices, and expected that it would fluctuate for some time below 1 percent amid modest demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Given recent international oil price movements and the government’s plan to raise public utility charges, however, members noted that downward inflationary pressures on the supply side would gradually weaken.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed them to have stabilized overall, thanks to the easing of risks in the external sector.",
        "Members noted that household lending growth was continuing to slow, influenced for instance by the government’s policy measures to stabilize the housing market and by the hike in the Base Rate.",
        "Members commented, however, that close attention should be given continually to the risk of financial imbalances building up, considering the continued demand for group loans and leasehold deposit funds.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member stated that the growth rate of the domestic and global economy had continued to slow, yet not deviating from the expected ranges, while inflation had decelerated further.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting and continue to monitor future changes in conditions at home and abroad a little longer.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, since the last MPB monetary policy meeting, the sluggishness of manufacturing output and investment had deepened in major countries while service activity and consumption had remained healthy.",
        "The member also saw that risk aversion in the financial markets and anxiety among economic agents had eased, thanks primarily to lessened concerns about US monetary policy normalization and to the ending of the US government shutdown.",
        "The member went on to assert that in the past, such developments often formed a virtuous circle with the real sector economy through improved consumer and business sentiment, with some time lag.",
        "The member thus judged them to be positive changes.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that since there still were high policy uncertainties in major countries, including the US-China trade negotations, it was necessary to maintain a closer examination of changes in these issues.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that concerns about growth outlook had heightened, with the unemployment rate up sharply and exports down further.",
        "The member, however, saw that exports weakness partly owed to the unfavorable price effect in petroleum and tech products, also attributing the rise in jobless rate to irregular factors related to the government’s job creating policy for the elderly.",
        "The member also expected fiscal expenditures to serve as a buffer against the risk of a sharp slowdown in the growth rate.",
        "Meanwhile the member raised concern that Korea’s export environment itself may have been changing, given that the slowdown of global growth has been concentrated in tradable sectors, which could be related to the protectionsim in major countries.",
        "Also, the member added that, on the domestic front, the sluggishness of private sector’s employment had persisted in the wake of various microeconomic policies that could affect structural changes in the labor market.",
        "These altogether raised caution in estimating the potential growth rate of the domestic economy, the member pointed out.",
        "The member assessed consumer price inflation to have slowed greatly and thought it would likely run considerably below 1 percent for some time.",
        "However, given recent international oil price movements and the government’s plan to hike public utility charges, the member forecast that downward pressures on the supply side would ease gradually.",
        "The member also found it noteworthy that, unlike consumer prices, business cycle-sensitive price indexes had been on the rise, while inflation expectations and core inflation excluding administered prices had been stable.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the member’s assessment was that risks of a buildup in financial imbalances were easing somewhat, with lending growth related to housing and real estate slowing generally.",
        "The member, however, saw that growth in sole proprietor loans was still high, and group loans and loans for leasehold deposits had maintained solid growth.",
        "The member thus mentioned that it would be necessary to monitor future developments a bit more.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting, since economic improvement in the private sector or a meaningful rebound of inflation did not seem likely in the short run.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, the member judged that the government’s active fiscal policy was serving as a buffer against the trend of slowing business activity in the private sector.",
        "The member noted that the government’s direct consumption had surged and private consumption associated with fiscal support had continued its moderate growth, but investment indicators had been declining rapidly.",
        "The member also took the view that with the corporate sector apart from the semiconductor industry showing poor performances overall, the steep rise in employment-related costs made it difficult to rule out the possibility of the employment slump persisting.",
        "The member also noted that there were signs of possible adjustments in household debt and the real estate market, influenced for instance by strong macroprudential policy.",
        "The member assessed uncertainties in external conditions to be reduced somewhat, with tensions in the international financial markets easing considerably after the US monetary policy authorities expressed flexibility regarding their policy stance, and with expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations growing.",
        "The member, however, noted that concerns about a global economic slowdown remained and a super boom in the business cycle of the semiconductor industry was entering a correction phase, and thus it was necessary to pay attention to the future developments.",
        "Looking at prices last year and this year, the member commented that consumer price inflation had seen major changes in line with severe fluctuations in oil prices, but core inflation with one-off factors excluded had already fallen to the lower-1 percent range last year.",
        "The member expressed the view that, since core inflation with administered prices excluded was not running above the mid-1 percent level, aggregate demand-side pressures were implied to be low.",
        "The member judged that underlying price inflation was unlikely to rebound significantly for some time, as business conditions in the private sector did not appear likely to improve in the short run.",
        "In consideration of the macroeconomic and financial market environments mentioned above, the member judged that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting, and expressed the opinion that future monetary policy should be based on the directions of additional indicators related to economic activity and inflationary conditions.",
        "One other member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.75 percent level at the current meeting, as there had been no significant changes in the Base Rate operating conditions and there were high uncertainties concerning developments in the international financial and economic environments.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, the member judged that there were growing concerns about a weakening of growth momentum, as exports had been sluggish, affected largely by a slowdown in the growth of the global economy and trade and also in the global semiconductor industry.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that private consumption had maintained gradual growth, and the government’s transfer expenditure expansion and measures to revitalize domestic demand were expected to have positive impacts on private consumption, adding that semiconductor exports were likely to recover from the second half of this year.",
        "In light of these factors, the member expected the domestic economy to stay close to the path forecast in January and not to deviate far from its potential level.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation was forecast to fluctuate below 1 percent for the time being, and this low inflation had caused substantial difficulties for policy communication under the inflation targeting framework.",
        "However, the member noted that central banks in major countries had been recently experiencing these difficulties as well, and that a substantial part of the low inflation had been attributable to supply-side factors or the government’s measures to stabilize people’s livelihoods, and went on to state that these factors should be dissociated from demand-side factors, which are the primary concern of monetary policy.",
        "Going forward, the member forecast consumer price inflation to rise to the mid-1 percent level in the second half, affected chiefly by increases in public utility bills and the expiration of a fuel tax cut.",
        "The member, however, argued that, in this process, consumer price inflation would be likely to exhibit high volatility in monthly terms due mainly to a base-period effect, which could cause confusion in the formation of inflation expectations.",
        "Looking at the financial markets, the member’s evaluation was that, despite continued concerns about slower growth, the financial markets had emerged from last December’s instability and started to pick up significantly as risk-off sentiment had been eased, mainly because of weaker expectations of the US Fed’s further rate hikes.",
        "The member forecast that it was highly uncertain whether a positive scenario―continued improvement in financial conditions weakening concerns about a real economic slowdown―or a negative scenario―sustained concerns about a real economic slowdown leading to a correction in the financial markets, as witnessed in December last year―would unfold.",
        "With regard to household lending, meanwhile, the member expressed the view that it was necessary to keep an eye on the risk of an accumulation of financial imbalances, since household lending had continued to exhibit slower growth but there remained demand for collective loans and for leasehold deposit funds.",
        "The member took the view that, taking into consideration the aforementioned macroeconomic and financial stability conditions, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting, and carefully decide whether to make further adjustments to the degree of monetary policy accommodation while comprehensively evaluating changes in macroeconomic and financial stability risks based on financial and economic indicators and economic forecasts henceforth.",
        "One member noted that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level at this meeting, since global economic growth had continued to slow, the growth path for this year was seen to face high downside risks, and inflation had remained low at around 1 percent.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was that on the external side global economic growth had continued to slow, and on the domestic front exports and investment related to external factors had been going through corrections.",
        "Looking at the US economy, the member judged that real economic indicators were favorable overall, but given indicators such as the spread between long- and short-term yields, economic prospects in the financial markets had not improved.",
        "The member, meanwhile, evaluated the euro area economy to have shown a downward trend of the growth path, with the German economy, which had been the axis of regional growth, showing noticeably slowed growth while Brexit and other sustained uncertainties going on.",
        "With regard to China, meanwhile, the member mentioned that real economic indicators had remained sluggish, but the recent stabilization of the financial market and the upward movements of M2 and other liquidity growth rates could be seen as positive changes.",
        "In reflection of the global economic trends mentioned above, the member assessed that Korea’s exports and investment had been going through corrections since the end of last year.",
        "The member judged that customs-cleared exports had been falling in line chiefly with the decrease in semiconductor prices, and with regard to investment, facilities investment had been going through an adjustment, particularly in the IT sector while construction investment had been undergoing a underlying correction as well.",
        "The member evaluated that private consumption had seemed to maintain growth that was modest but not strong enough to drive economic growth.",
        "The member took the view that the global financial markets had been somewhat stable overall, but high uncertainties remained regarding the growth paths of the global real economy and trade, and in this regard, with the effect of the contribution of government spending to growth excluded, there remained downside risks to the growth path of the Korean economy for this year as well.",
        "Concerning prices, the member noted that consumer price inflation had declined due mainly to slower growth in agricultural product prices and a shift to a decrease in oil prices, and core inflation had remained low at the 1 percent level since the second half of last year.",
        "The member mentioned that, considering the domestic and external real economic environments and the trends of oil prices and of the exchange rate, it would be difficult to expect inflation pressures for this year to surpass those of last year, and went on to state that the current situation indicated that downside risks to the January forecast by Bank of Korea Research Department had been growing.",
        "The member noted that core inflation in Korea had remained at the upper-1 percent level until 2017, curbing the downward trend of underlying inflation, but it had started to show different movements from 2018, remaining at the lower-1 percent level for a long period of time and went on to state that this trend was forecast to continue this year as well, which was a matter of concern to the monetary policy authorities.",
        "Meanwhile, the member pointed out that the recent low inflation had also been attributable to policy efforts to curb growth in administered prices.",
        "The member pointed to a need to keep in mind that the policy efforts to curb administered prices to promote the stability of people’s livelihoods could also have unintended effects such as a decline in inflation expectations, and went on to argue that, in terms of stable macroeconomic management, it would be desirable to relieve the upward pressures on administered prices to a certain extent and help the overall inflation rate rise to near its target.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting, as the economic situation at home and abroad had not changed much since the January meeting, nor had domestic demand pressures affecting underlying inflation, and it was necessary to gradually resolve the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "The member took the view that the global economy seemed to be stabilizing at the potential growth rate, which was lower than that of the pre-crisis period.",
        "The member noted that, with the US Federal Reserve less likely to raise its policy rate further, uncertainties in the global financial markets had been recently decreasing somewhat.",
        "However, the member judged that the structural problems had accumulated over a long period of time, particularly in advanced countries and that emerging economies’ current rate of growth was unlikely to be sustained because of their structural dependence on advanced countries.",
        "The member stated that Korea’s export growth had far exceeded global economic growth until the financial crisis, but had recently been increasing at a rate similar to that of the world economy, and judged that, as Korea’s export-oriented economic structure had shifted to focus on domestic demand, its potential growth rate had declined accordingly.",
        "The member also explained that investment related to real estate, construction and IT, which had once led economic growth, had continued to undergo corrections, which had seemingly contributed to a fall in the domestic economic growth rate to a level near the downwardly adjusted potential growth rate.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to remain close to the original forecast, although the future growth path faced both upside risks such as accommodative fiscal policy and downside risks including sluggish employment.",
        "The member evaluated that consumer price inflation had declined significantly since December last year but underlying inflation had remained largely unchanged since January.",
        "The member stated that sticky prices with administered prices counted out stood at the mid-2 percent level, and inflation expectations, although having recently weakened somewhat, remained above 2 percent and seemed to have anchored at the inflation target to some extent.",
        "The member mentioned that core inflation with administered prices excluded, however, remained flat at the mid-1 percent level, and explained that this was because leasehold deposits/monthly rents and industrial products, both highly weighted in the index, had contributed 0 percent over the past several months due to the oversupply of housing and weaker global prices, respectively.",
        "The member forecast that core inflation, even when the administered prices were counted out, would remain flat at the mid-1 percent level for the time being, as leasehold deposits and monthly rents as well as industrial product prices were likely to show weak growth for some time.",
        "The member assessed that the pace of accumulation of financial imbalances, caused by the concentration of funds in the real estate market, had been slowing recently, but the degree of accumulation remained higher than that of other countries.",
        "The member took the view that leverage in the Korean economy had increased over the past few years through various ways, including guarantees as well as lending, and inefficient investment and higher debt resulting from excessively increased leverage might put downward pressures on medium-term growth and inflation, threatening the achievement of the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The member also argued that, in order to resolve the accumulation of financial imbalances, a financial market environment should be created in which asset prices and risks are not distorted but are determined based on fundamentals.",
        "One other member expressed the view that, although concerns about downside risks to the global economy had grown somewhat, the Korean economy had continued to show growth not deviating far from the level forecast in January and inflation pressures were unlikely to be large for the time being.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level while continuing to monitor real economic and financial stability conditions.",
        "With respect to the global economy, the member evaluated that concerns about downside risks had grown somewhat larger since the January forecast.",
        "The member projected that the US economy would be favorable overall, while the euro area economy was likely to show weaker growth than the forecast in January due to sluggish German economic indicators and political uncertainties.",
        "The member pointed out that the Chinese economy was forecast to slow, and close monitoring was needed in that regard.",
        "The member also noted that international oil prices had recently rebounded while the pace of global trade growth had been slowing, and attention should be paid to the possible effects of these changes in external conditions on the Korean economy.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member took the view that the continued corrections in facilities and construction investment and the faster decline of exports were causes for concern, although private consumption had maintained modest growth despite sluggish employment.",
        "The member noted that the recent export sluggishness had been attributable partly to negative effects from certain items and regions, such as falls in semiconductor and oil prices and the slowdown in China’s domestic demand, and it should be closely analyzed how much these factors could be improved going forward.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to examine whether export sluggishness had been attributable to the weaker global competitiveness of Korea’s manufacturing sector.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that major industries such as manufacturing and construction had continued to experience sluggish employment and the wholesale & retail and lodging & restaurant industries had continued to face difficulties.",
        "In that regard, the member stressed that it would be necessary to closely monitor the effects of these factors on private consumption going forward.",
        "As mentioned above, the member assessed the Korean economy as maintaining growth not deviating far from the level forecast in January, despite the global economy having slowed somewhat, and expected the government sector to continue to play an active role this year as well and support growth to a certain extent.",
        "The member evaluated that there were growing downside risks to inflation, with consumer price inflation standing at 0.8 percent in January.",
        "The member expressed the view that continued monitoring of movements of international oil prices and administered prices including public utility charges would be needed going forward.",
        "The member added that demand-side inflation pressures were likely to remain modest, and in light of this, the current accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained.",
        "With respect to financial stability, the member assessed that the situation appeared more positive than last year.",
        "The member stated that the domestic financial markets had been stable and household debt had exhibited slower growth affected largely by strong government measures, and expected this trend to continue this year.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that it would be necessary to keep an eye on the trends of real estate prices and household debt growth for some time before judging whether an environment had been created in which financial imbalances could be clearly resolved.",
        "Finally, the member stressed that factors such as the possibility of the US Federal Reserve adjusting the speed of its policy rate hikes had played a huge role in promoting stability in the global financial markets, and it would be necessary to keep a careful watch on future developments of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy direction.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved unanimously by the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "pace of global economic growth has continued to slow somewhat.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets has continued the trend of decrease seen last month, as expectations of an adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s pace of monetary policy normalization and of progress in the US-China trade negotiations have heightened.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit.",
        "growth not diverging significantly from its potential level, as consumption has continued to grow modestly, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have continued and export growth has slowed.",
        "Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the number of persons employed having increased only slightly.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January.",
        "Consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually toward the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue.",
        "consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and reductions in the extents of increase in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the low- to mid-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1%, slightly lower than the path projected in January, and then run at the mid-1% level from the second half of this year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "risen mainly on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated within narrow ranges.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have fallen slightly.",
        "that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, global trade growth had continued to slow and economic growth in major countries had shown sluggishness in line with the escalation of trade conflicts between major countries and an increase in geopolitical risks.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members judged that preferences for safe-haven assets had strengthened in reflection of these heightened uncertainties.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, with the trend of decline in exports stemming from the contraction in global trade continuing, facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo adjustments.",
        "Members voiced concerns that, as household and business sentiments were contracting, growth in private consumption showed signs of weakening.",
        "Members judged that the downside risks to the future growth path had increased in light of these domestic and international conditions.",
        "Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low at around the mid-to-upper 0% range, as supply-side factors had acted as downward pressures and demand-side inflationary pressures had weakened.",
        "With demand-side inflationary pressures remaining low, members forecast consumer price inflation to decline further, influenced by the base effect of sharp price increases for some items last year, but then to gradually rise to the 1% range.",
        "Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that volatility had increased greatly with long-term interest rates falling significantly and the stock market slumping.",
        "Members also saw that household debt had been continuing to show much slower growth in the first half of 2019.",
        "Given that apartment prices were shifting to increases in some areas and the slowdown in household lending was gradually moderating, however, members judged that continued attention should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "Meanwhile, members’ assessment was that, in the foreign exchange markets, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had risen considerably and exchange rate volatility had increased, but external soundness indicators remained favorable.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period, while two members called for a 0.25 percentage point cut.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current The member saw that, as trade disputes had escalated and political uncertainties had heightened since the previous MPB meeting, volatility in the global financial markets had increased and the trend of low growth had become further entrenched.",
        "The member noted that uncertainties surrounding service industries, which are assessed to have been drivers of employment and consumption in major countries, looked to have increased, due to ongoing sluggishness in the IT sector and the continued scaling down of manufacturing production.",
        "The member’s assessment was that major countries were responding to this situation with accommodative monetary policies, and these policy responses were inevitable from the perspective of inflation targeting.",
        "The member, however, noted that even some central bankers had raised doubts about whether such responses could be fundamental solutions to the current problems.",
        "The member pointed out that, given that political uncertainties and the structural weakening of the virtuous circle of income and investment caused the demand slump, there was uncertainty as to the extent of macroeconomic policy responses that should be taken and to the amount of costs that would be incurred as a result.",
        "The member explained that these doubts had been raised because accumulated financial imbalances may have already been expanded due to interest rates, which should play the most important role in resource allocation, remaining low for a long period.",
        "The member assessed that growth had weakened in Korea as well, due to a combination of structural problems and global issues.",
        "The member saw that economic growth was below its potential level, due to a re-correction in the real estate market and a delay in the recovery of IT industry activity.",
        "The member noted that inflation remained low in reflection of these domestic and international conditions, and price indices showing demand-side pressures remained flat in the upper-1% range.",
        "Although expected inflation had declined slightly in August, as in July, the member expressed the view that for the time being it was necessary to monitor what impacts the recent rate cut and expansionary fiscal policy would have on expected inflation in the future.",
        "Taking the following points into consideration, the member expressed the view that it seemed proper for the Korean economy to use an expansionary macroeconomic policy mix with a focus placed on fiscal policy.",
        "The member first saw that sluggish demand was attributable to structural factors.",
        "The member commented that, in a situation in which resources are not allocated flexibly due to a number of structural factors, or in which corporate debt ratios are already high owing to prolonged and continued low interest rates, a fiscal policy that selectively supports vulnerable groups could be more efficient.",
        "Next, the member pointed out that the possibility of capital becoming concentrated in the real estate market was still high.",
        "The member noted that fiscal policy is more effective in stimulating demand while reining in financial imbalances.",
        "Last, the member presented the opinion that stimulation of demand through fiscal policy could contribute more to a reduction in exchange rate volatility than that through monetary policy.",
        "The member saw that the won was seeking a new equilibrium in reflection of several downside risks to the Korean economy, and as the won was in sync with the yuan, volatility had expanded.",
        "The member meanwhile assessed that, when making a simple comparison among major OECD countries with respect to the combined effects on GDP growth of fiscal stimulus for this year and of recent policy rate changes, Korea was implementing the most expansionary macroeconomic policy.",
        "The member judged this policy stance to be appropriate for the moment, but emphasized that close attention should be paid to the possibility that the US-China trade dispute and Japan’s export regulations could be prolonged or further expand.",
        "Finally, the member emphasized that not only large-scale fiscal expansion but also efficient targeting of expenditure sectors were essential to ensure the efficiency of such a policy mix.",
        "The member added that it was urgent to strongly implement mid- to long-term reforms for more fundamental structural problems, thus securing national competitiveness and seeking the creation of value added in new areas.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current The member diagnosed that the Korean economy was in a considerable slump.",
        "The member saw that exports were continuing to decline significantly, due to a correction in semiconductor activity and to a contraction in international trade stemming from the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member’s assessment was that this was working to cause a decrease in facilities investment through a slump in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The member also judged that, while construction investment had not been showing any sign of breaking out of its current correction, private consumption growth had been slowing of late.",
        "The member’s assessment was that demand in the private sector had stagnated overall, and weak growth dependent entirely on expansionary fiscal policy was continuing.",
        "The member mentioned that inflation was declining in reflection of shrinking aggregate demand.",
        "The member saw that consumer price inflation ran at 0.6% in the first half of this year and could decline to around 0% in the second half, albeit temporarily.",
        "The member’s assessment was that underlying price inflation with temporary factors excluded had remained at around 1% recently, far below the target.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, given recent economic conditions, it was difficult to see what could be a force driving up inflation in the near future.",
        "The member voiced concern that changes in the domestic and international economic environments had been worsening further since the last MPB meeting.",
        "The member’s assessment was that downside risks to the Korean economy had heightened further due to an escalation of the US-China trade dispute, rising tensions with Japan, and emerging concerns about the US economy, which had maintained solid growth.",
        "The member also expressed the view that fiscal policy alone would have limited capacity to sustain growth without any medium-term recovery in private-sector demand, as tax revenue growth stagnated in line with the economic decline.",
        "The member diagnosed that, given recent economic conditions, growth for this year could run below 2% and it was difficult to be optimistic about economic recovery for next year.",
        "Accordingly, the member took the view that it was desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.50% to 1.25% to secure a buffer against the trend of sluggish demand in the private sector.",
        "The member saw that, judging the monetary policy stance using standard methodology, the and the expected benefits from deferring the necessary policy adjustment were unclear.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that securing economic recovery in the medium- to long-term would require not only short-term macroeconomic policy but also strengthened policy efforts to enhance competitiveness in the private sector.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that there had even been some concerns about a global recession due to the continuation of slower growth in the world economy.",
        "The member assessed domestic growth to be weakening in sync with such global economic conditions.",
        "The member saw that, given the Korean economy’s high economic openness and its heavy dependence on exports, a deterioration in external conditions could have greater impacts, which seemed to have been reflected in the fact that Korea had recently seen a larger decline in stock prices and more severe currency depreciation than major countries.",
        "The member judged slower global growth to be mainly attributable to so-called slowbalization, or the slowing of globalization.",
        "The member’s assessment was that decades of progress in globalization, while having generated substantial negative side effects, had also greatly contributed to sustained growth in the world economy based on the international division of labor according to comparative advantages and on the free movement of goods, services, capital, technologies and labor.",
        "The member, however, noted that, the recent slowbalization was heightening concern that economic prosperity backed by expanded international trade and market opening could be reversed.",
        "The member saw that slower growth in the world economy looked to be inevitable for some time, due to contractions in trade and investment.",
        "The member voiced concern about the possibility of a negative feedback loop whereby the consequent deteriorated financial and real economic indicators and dampened household and corporate sentiments would affect consumption and investment.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that monetary and fiscal policies should be expansionary to mitigate the negative impacts of external shocks.",
        "The member, however, added that, if the global supply chain weakened further and the movements of goods and production factors were constrained further—in other words, if a structural supply shock occurred—macroeconomic policies for adjusting aggregate demand would not be a fundamental solution.",
        "The member noted that it was necessary to respond to the contraction in consumer and investment sentiments by operating accommodative monetary policy to cope with slower growth, although monetary policy would not be a fundamental solution.",
        "The member commented that the Base Rate had been lowered at the last MPB meeting from this perspective.",
        "The member saw that it was desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting, since it was necessary to give balanced consideration to the burden on the financial stability side, including the following issues: the recent faster growth in banks’ household lending; the shift to an increase in apartment prices and increased expectations for higher apartment prices, particularly in Seoul; and the expanded volatility of global capital flows.",
        "One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at 1.50% at this time.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, since the previous meeting, trade conflicts between major countries and geopolitical risks had been growing and the growth momentum for the global economy had continued to soften.",
        "The member evaluated that, although growth had been slowing relatively gradually, this decline in the growth rate had been seen mostly in the manufacturing and investment sectors that are closely related to global trade and the Korean economy, and went on to express concerns that global manufacturing and investment were not highly likely to show meaningful improvement in the second half of this year.",
        "Most importantly, the member mentioned that attention should be paid to the contraction of corporate sentiment amid the extremely unstable policy environment that would affect performance of the tradables sector.",
        "The member assessed that the US and other countries with favorable external soundness had been implementing accommodative monetary policies and some of them had been undergoing fiscal expansion, but the recent strengthening of the flight to quality in the financial markets was limiting the transmission channels of these policies.",
        "The member went on to argue that uncertainty surrounding the future growth path remained high in this regard.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had maintained weak growth due to a combination of structural and cyclical factors.",
        "The member evaluated that the significant rebound in the real GDP growth rate during the second quarter had been attributable mostly to increased government spending while the contribution of the private sector had decreased, and that in this respect, the rebound in real GDP could not been seen as an encouraging result for the growth outlook for the second half.",
        "The member noted that recent monthly indicators suggested that corporate and consumer sentiment had been weakening, investment had continued to go through a correction and private consumption had been growing at a somewhat slower pace.",
        "Concerning exports, the member stated that the decline in the export volume had slowed somewhat entering the third quarter, but due to growing uncertainties surrounding external conditions, exports would remain sluggish for the time being, with their volatility increasing significantly.",
        "The member assessed that there was a growing possibility of the future growth path falling below the July forecast, especially in line with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the strengthening of Japan’s export restrictions, and added that this could weaken demand-side inflation pressures and act as a factor increasing the time needed for consumer price inflation to get back to the target level.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that the spread of global risk-off sentiment had increased financial market volatility significantly, and the policy implications of the rising won-dollar exchange rate could be examined from various perspectives.",
        "The member took the view that, as the depreciation of a country’s currency has a significant impact on its export competitiveness and inflation in both theoretical and empirical terms, the won’s depreciation during a phase of economic slowdown could work to partly ease the downside risks to the economy and inflation.",
        "On the other hand, however, the member noted that there had been many instances during times of insufficient external soundness when the won depreciated rapidly following external shocks, resulting in financial instability and economic welfare loss.",
        "The member assessed Korea’s external soundness as currently being substantially favorable, but considering that the current account surplus had been decreasing gradually and the external debt ratio had been showing a modest increase, the member emphasized that it would be necessary to pay keen attention to and monitor various indicators related to external soundness.",
        "In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that growing financial market volatility and uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas economic conditions had substantially increased the possibility of a realization of the downside risks to growth and inflation that were of concern in the July forecast.",
        "However, given that a certain degree of downside risk had already been taken into consideration in the course of making a rate-cut decision at the previous meeting, that the effect of a Base Rate cut spreads with a time lag, that expansionary fiscal policy had been adopted for counter-cyclical purposes, and that the slowdown in the growth rate had been attributable in part to structural factors, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at 1.50% at the present meeting while taking more time to examine whether the current policy mix would effectively serve as a buffer against downside risks to the medium-term growth and inflation paths.",
        "Another member took the view that an adjustment to the Base Rate policy was needed to keep up with changes in economic conditions, and in this regard it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate to 1.25% at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic and external environments had deteriorated since the previous meeting.",
        "On the external side, the member noted that, while the continued slowdown in global trade had been negatively affecting major countries’ real economies, uncertainties involving the US-China trade dispute and other existing risk factors had been growing and new geopolitical risk factors including protests in Hong Kong had emerged.",
        "In this regard, the member pointed out there were growing concerns that the global economy would continue to slow or fall into an even worse slump, unlike the original expectation that the economy would recover in the second half of this year.",
        "The member also judged that the longer-than-expected sluggishness of global trade and the consequent global economic slowdown, combined with geopolitical factors, had recently been affecting economic sentiment negatively.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that capital in advanced market countries was shifting from stock to bond markets, and emerging market countries were seeing their financial asset prices falling and exchange rates showing greater volatility due to capital outflows, suggesting the strengthening of a flight to quality in the international financial markets.",
        "The member assessed that, as the global economic environment had been deteriorating more than expected, Korea’s export slump had been worsening somewhat, and facilities investment, which is closely related to exports, had also remained lackluster.",
        "The member also expressed concerns that private consumption, having increased gradually in the first half, was exhibiting signs of slower-than-expected growth in the second half.",
        "The member evaluated that the continued strong growth in nominal wages was a positive factor, but it seemed to be having only limited effects on improvement in consumer sentiment as well as income conditions of households as a whole.",
        "In comprehensive consideration of these trends, the member assessed that there were increasing downside risks to the Research Department’s July growth forecast of 2.2% for this year.",
        "The member noted that inflation had remained very low, and from a long-term perspective, it had remained below the target of 2% since 2013.",
        "The member also assessed that, since the beginning of this year in particular, core inflation and consumer price inflation had both remained within the 0% range, entering a new phase of sluggishness.",
        "The member expressed concerns that inflation was increasingly likely to remain weak next year as well, due to the growing likelihood that Korea’s economic slump would be prolonged.",
        "The member stressed that it would be necessary to take aggressive measures to manage inflation expectations, considering that sustained low inflation could lead to a decline in inflation expectations.",
        "More specifically, the member expressed the view that, aside from adjusting the Base Rate, which is the central bank’s direct monetary policy instrument, more aggressive communication policy instruments, such as the forward guidance introduced by major central banks facing similar problems, should be explored and their use should be considered.",
        "The member assessed that, despite the recent increase in international financial market unrest, the trends of CDS premiums and other indicators pointed to the strength of Korea’s international credit standing.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the won’s depreciation reflected mainly changes in the macroeconomic conditions at home and abroad and was not serious enough to raise concerns about a fall in Korea’s international credit standing.",
        "The member added that flexible fluctuations in the exchange rate would be necessary for nominal macroeconomic variables to return to normal in an economy where interest rate policy is implemented under an inflation targeting regime.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that, in cases where underlying inflation pressures had built up with respect to items for which prices are administered, which account for a substantial part of Korea’s consumer prices, it would be desirable in terms of stable macroeconomic management to actively consider reflecting these factors in price-setting policy.",
        "In summary, the member judged that the economy and inflation had remained sluggish, in line with the worsening of economic conditions led by the global trade slowdown, and assessed downside risks as having increased somewhat compared with the July forecast path.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the Base Rate policy should be adjusted to keep up with changes in economic conditions, and that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate to 1.25% in this regard.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.50% level at this meeting and take more time to observe real economic conditions as well as domestic and overseas financial market trends.",
        "The member assessed that uncertainties in global economy had been increasing, affected largely by the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member noted that US consumption and employment indicators had been exhibiting favorable movements, while the Chinese economic slowdown had been becoming evident.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the prolongation of the US-China trade dispute could have negative spillover effects on the Korean and global economies.",
        "Moreover, the member noted that various geopolitical risk factors were spreading simultaneously and stressed the need to closely monitor these developments.",
        "The member mentioned that, in line with the sluggishness of the global economy and trade, Korea’s facilities and construction investment as well as exports had continued to go through corrections.",
        "The member judged that the situation concerning private consumption, having exhibited modest growth, had worsened with retail sales declining for the second consecutive month, and added that private consumption growth was highly likely to fall below the previous forecast in this regard.",
        "The member also noted that, amid the sustained sluggishness of semiconductor exports and China-bound exports, there were some concerns about the possibility of facilities investment, previously expected to rebound from the second half, remaining lackluster until the year-end.",
        "The member also expressed concerns that the worsening Korea-Japan conflict, along with the US-China trade dispute, would add to downside risks to growth.",
        "The member argued that, although employment had been showing improvement due mainly to a base-period effect, it was a little too early to be optimistic about employment, as it had continued to worsen in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The member forecast that inflation could be even lower than the July forecast in the second half.",
        "The member mentioned that this would be affected by supply-side factors, such as the stabilization of agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices, but the fact that core inflation was also running within the 0% range was worrisome.",
        "The member expressed the view that it would be necessary to maintain accommodative monetary policy given that downside risks to the consumer price inflation forecast had been increasing amid growing uncertainties concerning the domestic economy in line with global economic instability.",
        "The member judged that, in the domestic financial markets, long-term interest rates had declined significantly, reflecting expectations of an economic slowdown, and the stock market had also been sluggish.",
        "Concerning household debt, the member noted that growth in household debt had slowed greatly in the first half, affected largely by strong government measures.",
        "The member added, however, that attention should be paid to fact that household debt had generally increased at a faster pace in the second half and went on to argue that continuous monitoring was needed of growing household debt in line with increasing real estate transactions resulting from recent real estate price rises in some regions.",
        "With regard to the international financial markets, the member mentioned that various opinions had been suggested regarding the possibility of additional rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and with the US Treasury yield curve having inverted, there had been a keen interest in how the Fed saw the US economy and in which direction it would operate monetary policy.",
        "The member emphasized that developments related to the Fed’s monetary policy should be monitored closely given their significant impacts on Korea’s financial markets, while attention should be devoted to making sure that foreign exchange market volatility would not increase excessively.",
        "The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and external economic conditions mentioned above, it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50% at the present meeting and take more time to monitor real economic conditions and financial market developments at home and abroad.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho, Dongchul and Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at its current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "`□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has slowed as trade has contracted.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets has increased.",
        "Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen significantly in line mainly with the US-China trade dispute and concerns about the consequent global economic slowdown.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued.",
        "Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "With respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board judges that the uncertainties concerning the growth path forecast have further increased, owing chiefly to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "`□` Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the 2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time at the lower-0% level as downside risks to the path projected in July have increased, and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from next year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "`□` The high volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has continued, in line mainly with concerns about the US-China trade dispute, geopolitical risks, and the consequent economic slowdowns at home and abroad.",
        "Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen significantly, while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably.",
        "The slowdown in household lending growth has weakened somewhat, while housing prices have continued their downtrend but have risen in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "`□` Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while closely examining any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.",
        "It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, major countries had shown stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter, but underlying growth had continued to exhibit a slowing trend, and trade growth had also slowed.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members judged that, as risk aversion had increased, due for instance to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute, stock prices had fallen and the currencies of emerging economies had depreciated.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that private consumption had continued to grow albeit slowly, although facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo adjustments and exports had remained sluggish.",
        "Members expected growth to rebound, aided by the pickup in the government sector in the second quarter, although the growth trend had been sluggish in the first quarter.",
        "Members, however, saw that uncertainties concerning the forecast path had risen, due chiefly to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low, running below 1%, due to the combined effects of structural and cyclical factors.",
        "Members saw that there were some upside risks such as the exchange rate and international oil prices.",
        "Members, however, assessed the downside risks to the projected path of inflation to have increased somewhat, given the recent inflation trend as well as the government’s social-welfare policies and its policy measures to stabilize people’s livelihoods.",
        "Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that market interest rates had fallen significantly and the stock market had been sluggish, but credit market funding conditions had remained stable.",
        "Members, meanwhile, noted that household debt had been continuing to show slower growth, but a significant number of apartments were scheduled to be available for sale and to be newly occupied.",
        "Members, thus, found the need to keep a close watch on the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member stated that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, despite concerns about weakening inflation expectations, as it was desirable to sustain the current accommodative monetary policy stance given the expansionary fiscal policy, which was being pursued in consideration of a number of structural problems and the current policy operating conditions.",
        "The member noted that, since last monetary policy decision meeting, inflation had remained in the mid-0% range and some indicators of inflation expectations had been responding to this.",
        "In addition, the member expressed the view that downside risks to external conditions looked to have expanded and the trend of domestic growth to have weakened, but more accurate assessments could be made using the relevant indicators in the second quarter.",
        "The member found that price inflation in Korea had fallen to a low level compared to those in major countries because the negative contribution of administered prices had continued and the effects from oil price movements had been asymmetric.",
        "The member, however, added that a trend of decline, albeit moderate, in prices of personal services with administered prices excluded implied a possible weakening of pressures on the demand side.",
        "The member evaluated that the weakening of demand-side pressures was attributable to a decline in the potential growth rate to the mid-2% range or lower.",
        "The member noted that significant changes had been seen in the Korean economy, including a rapid rebalancing of the economic structure toward domestic demand-driven economy and an acceleration of population aging.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member assessed that adjustments to over-investment in construction and a delay in facilities investment related to the IT sector were increasing downward pressures on the economy.",
        "Concerning private consumption, however, the member saw the need to monitor the relevant developments a bit longer, but assessed it to have continued its steady growth in the first quarter as well, given base effects related to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the irregular execution of government spending at the beginning of the year.",
        "The member mentioned that, although financial imbalances had been narrowing, they were still wider than those of other countries.",
        "The member judged that, despite ample liquidity, demand for funds to expand production capacities was not great, due to the weakening of the virtuous circle of the economy.",
        "The member expressed the need to take action under a broad framework of structural reforms, including macroprudential policy as well as a mix of fiscal and monetary policies, in an effort to increase the potential growth rate and to ease downside pressures on the economy.",
        "The member noted that, if demand was stimulated through monetary policy alone without these efforts, the buildup of financial imbalances, along with inflation, could accelerate in another way, thus possibly incurring social costs.",
        "The member expected that fiscal policy would contribute considerably to economic recovery, due to a large year-on-year increase in the managed fiscal deficit.",
        "The member also expected selective support for vulnerable groups to increase.",
        "The member judged that a policy response to minimize the negative side effects of macroeconomic policy would be a combination of maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance and, in terms of fiscal policy, ensuring timely execution of this year’s budget.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need to keep a close eye on the developments in the domestic economy, as downside risks to external conditions had increased, as exemplified by the delayed recovery of the global IT-related cycle and the continuation of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member added that, while considering whether to adjust the macroeconomic policy stance in accordance with changes in relevant conditions, efforts should also be made to seek various policy measures to enhance the efficiency of monetary policy and reduce its adverse effects.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting, while continuing to examine the development of external risks, such as the US-China trade dispute, and continuing to monitor whether the trend of growth in the domestic economy would recover.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, with respect to the global economy, the downside risks to growth had been increasing since the April forecast.",
        "The member commented that, as the US-China trade negotiations had unexpectedly failed to find a way to reach an agreement, the economies of the two countries had become unstable and concerns about the negative impacts on the economies of other countries had grown.",
        "The member added that, with political uncertainties such as Brexit serving as downside risks to the European economy, world trade growth was slowing.",
        "The member saw that, in the international financial markets, price variables, such as interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, were showing instability.",
        "As market volatility was highly likely to heighten for some time, the member judged that thorough preparations were needed.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that negative growth had been recorded in the first quarter due to a decrease in the contribution of the government sector.",
        "The member also saw that, up until recently, adjustments to facilities and construction investment had continued and exports had remained mired in a slump.",
        "The member commented that the Bank of Korea’s baseline forecast was that from the latter half of this year, exports and facilities investment would rebound along with a recovery in the semiconductor sector and a resolution of the US-China conflict.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that there was also a concern that the intensity of the economic recovery would be weaker than expected.",
        "The member noted that employment growth had slowed somewhat in April, but expected employment to improve compared to the original forecast on an annual basis.",
        "The member stated that it was necessary to pay continued attention to the deterioration in employment conditions in the manufacturing sector, and to the employment situations in the wholesale & retail and lodging & restaurants sectors.",
        "Given these points, the member stated that it had become more important to judge if the Korean economy would recover in the second half of this year in line with the Bank’s forecast.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to closely observe growth in the second quarter and make an accurate forecast of second-half growth.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had remained lower than previously forecast.",
        "The member stated that this was undoubtedly due to a combination of structural and cyclical factors, but added that, since the economy was sustaining a negative output gap, it was necessary to maintain an accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member noted that, on the financial stability side, household debt growth was slowing, due mainly to strong government household debt measures, and market interest rates had been declining greatly in the financial markets, while there was a slump in the stock market.",
        "The member, however, judged the funding conditions in the credit market to have remained stable.",
        "Noting the recently heightened synchronization between the Korean won and the Chinese yuan, the member emphasized that it was necessary to closely monitor developments in the financial and foreign exchange markets through which the impacts of the US-China trade conflict on the real economy could be amplified.",
        "One other member took the view that, since domestic and international economic conditions were not favorable and downside risks to the economy had been materializing, it was desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points at the current meeting to buffer against the slowdowns in price inflation and business activity in the private sector.",
        "The member saw that, with respect to the domestic economy, the adjustment to construction investment had been sustained and the declines in exports and facilities investment were continuing.",
        "Accordingly, the member’s assessment was that economic activity generally had weakened and growth in private consumption was gradually slowing.",
        "The member judged that overall growth had been fluctuating in accordance with the degree of the growth contribution of the government sector, with growth in the private sector being almost at a standstill since the fourth quarter of last year.",
        "The member took the view that, looking at biannual statistics, the slowdown in the Korean economy had become more evident since last year.",
        "The member expected that economic growth for the first half of this year was unlikely to rise well above 2%, even with a possible rebound in the second quarter.",
        "The member added that the downturn in the nominal growth rate had been steeper, and there was a growing possibility that it would fall to the 1% level, falling below the real economic growth rate in the first half of this year.",
        "The member judged that future economic conditions would not be favorable.",
        "The member commented that, amid the ongoing slowdown in the global economy, exports had not been showing any sign of recovery, and it had become more difficult to expect a recovery in exports in the immediate future, due to recently growing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member added that it was also difficult to expect a significant rebound in private consumption due to ongoing employment sluggishness and the slowing pace of increase in household income.",
        "The member expected increased fiscal spending to serve as a partial buffer against the trend of economic downturn.",
        "The member, however, took the view that it was uncertain whether such an increase would lead to a rebound in private-sector activity.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that consumer price inflation was decelerating further to the mid-0% range, in line with the contraction in economic activity.",
        "The member took the view that the decline to the lower-1% level of core inflation with “prices of administered items” excluded, in particular, implied that the recent slowing of inflation was not attributable to one-off disturbances.",
        "The member commented that if the current economic downturn continued, underlying inflation could run well below its target for a long time.",
        "The member went on to voice a concern that this could undermine the credibility of the inflation targeting regime, thus greatly hampering future monetary policy.",
        "With the aforementioned economic conditions taken into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to 1.50%.",
        "The member noted that, at this time, the Research Department’s April forecast looked to have significant downside risks, and even if the forecast materialized, it was still difficult to see the Base Rate of 1.50% as low relative to economic fundamentals.",
        "The member went on to note that any delay in changing the Base Rate, on the other hand, would lead to accumulated economic and social losses stemming from increased idle resources.",
        "The member added that policy measures to enhance macroprudential stability, including the DSR regulations, should be implemented in a consistent and steady manner going forward, since they could gradually reduce potential risks to the financial markets stemming from household debt.",
        "One member, meanwhile, presented the view that although downside risks to the growth forecast had increased, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and take time to examine changes in domestic and external conditions, as growth and inflation were expected to improve gradually.",
        "Looking at the recent changes in domestic and external conditions, the member assessed downside risks to the growth and price paths as having increased somewhat from the April forecast.",
        "The member mentioned that global economic and trade growth had been slowing, the US-China trade dispute had intensified unexpectedly, and there were concerns that semiconductor demand might pick up later than expected.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, with the risk aversion tendencies in the domestic and overseas financial markets having strengthened, stock prices had fallen and EME currencies including the Korean won had weakened, and as a result, household and corporate economic sentiment had weakened.",
        "On the other hand, however, the member noted that major international organizations forecast next year’s global economic and trade growth rates to be much higher than this year’s and that the prevailing forecast was that the US-China trade dispute would be resolved in some way, although there were concerns about its prolongation.",
        "The member stated that the volume of semiconductor exports had been showing faster growth, demand for DRAM chips was likely to increase gradually, and government fiscal spending, having been sluggish in the first quarter, had been growing centering around investment, and the member expected the growth contribution of the government sector to rise.",
        "The member mentioned that this forecast implied that the factors that had negatively affected the domestic economy in the first quarter would not do so or would even positively affect the Korean economy going forward.",
        "As for the price path, the member’s assessment was that, although factors such as the government’s welfare policies would act as downside risks, there were upside risks as well, such as global oil prices and exchange rates, and the member forecast consumer price inflation to rise gradually to run in the low- to mid-1% range in the second half of this year.",
        "The member also noted that, although consumer price inflation remained low, the general public’s inflation perceptions and expectations were seen to be slightly higher than the 2% target.",
        "Taking into overall consideration the above-mentioned factors, the member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level and monitor how domestic and external conditions would change, since growth and inflation were highly likely to show upward movement as forecast in April this year, despite downside risks.",
        "The member also mentioned that continued attention to the risk of financial imbalances was needed, since bank lending to households had expanded somewhat in April and May and a substantial number of apartments were scheduled to be available for sale and to be newly occupied, although household debt growth had significantly slowed recently.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged at this meeting and keep an eye on the related developments, since uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had mounted and caution about heightening volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets was needed.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had achieved better-than-expected growth in the first quarter, particularly in major countries, but this growth was unlikely to be sustained as improvement in the growth rate had been mostly seen in non-manufacturing sectors and one-off factors had made a substantial contribution.",
        "The member also judged that uncertainties surrounding the medium- to long-term growth path had increased, with the US-China trade conflict further worsening and financial market volatility heightening.",
        "The member stated that risk aversion was spreading at a modest pace thanks to major countries’ policy responses to potential downside risks, but expressed concern that if the trade conflict were to be prolonged going forward, corporate investment would remain sluggish due to uncertainties, substantially limiting global trade and manufacturing activities.",
        "The member mentioned that there were growing concerns in the financial markets about the possibility of economic downturn, as Korea’s GDP growth had shifted to negative in the first quarter of this year and destabilizing external factors had emerged.",
        "However, since the decline in GDP in the first quarter had been attributable substantially to the volatility of the contribution of the government sector, the member expected a substantial rebound of the growth rate in the second quarter, considering fiscal plans for this year and fiscal spending to date.",
        "In addition, the member forecast the growth contribution of the private sector to increase somewhat, as the export volume was shifting to modest growth and the sluggishness of the manufacturing sector was showing signs of easing somewhat.",
        "However, with the US-China trade dispute escalating again and consumer and corporate sentiment shrinking, the member judged that the uncertainty of the growth forecast for the second half and onwards had increased even further.",
        "Meanwhile, the member found it noteworthy that the economic slowdown had been attributable partly to structural factors.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, on the external side, trade protectionism had been causing changes to the world trade order and global value chains, dampening intra-regional trade and increasing production costs.",
        "On the domestic front, the member expressed the view that, as the working-age population had been decreasing and labor market-related institutional arrangements had been changing, it would be necessary to enhance productivity and improve the economic activity participation rate to maintain the growth potential.",
        "The member added that, since domestic and overseas economic conditions were undergoing rapid structural changes, a more careful approach should be adopted with respect to the estimation of the potential growth rate and the output gap.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation, although having remained at a low level in April as well, had increased slightly, and expected that the easing of supply-side downward pressures would last for some time, boosting inflation even further.",
        "The member added that this forecast was also supported by the fact that increase in inflation indicators not heavily affected by supply-side factors, such as the price index of items sensitive to business cycles, had continued to outpace consumer price inflation.",
        "Looking at the financial conditions, the member noted that volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets had increased significantly with the US-China trade dispute deteriorating again.",
        "The member presented the view that there was only a limited possibility of sudden capital outflows, with external soundness indicators remaining favorable, but attention should be paid to the gradual decline in the current account surplus amid high external uncertainties.",
        "The member also commented that the risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances should be monitored carefully, as there were strong demand for household loans in line with the increased number of apartments scheduled for sale and occupation.",
        "One other member argued that, although there was a need for a Base Rate cut given the increased downside risks to the growth path and the sluggishness of inflation, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period, as it would be advisable to signal a change in the policy stance in advance.",
        "With respect to the real economy, the member noted that on the external side conditions were becoming worse as the global economy had continued to decelerate and the US-China trade dispute had been escalating, and on the domestic side there was a growing likelihood of growth slowing even further with the first-quarter growth rate coming in below the original forecast.",
        "The member judged that the US and eurozone economies had exhibited higher-than-expected growth in the first quarter, but looking at the underlying trends, the US economy had been slowing gradually and the eurozone economy had remained sluggish.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the US-China trade dispute had been intensifying while the global goods trade volume had not been showing any sign of rebound after its plunge in the fourth quarter of last year, adding to the risk that global trade would remain lackluster this year.",
        "The member noted that Korea’s exports and investment had been undergoing adjustments since the end of last year, in reflection of the global economic trend, and household consumption had also exhibited slowing growth since the second half of last year.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the economy had been expected to slow this year, due largely to the negative effects of declining semiconductor prices, but the –0.34% GDP growth rate during the first quarter had been worse than expected.",
        "The member judged that it would be difficult to view the growth path of the domestic economy as consistent with the Bank of Korea’s April forecast of 2.5%, considering that no clear improvement had been seen in indicator trends and external conditions had been deteriorating with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "With regard to inflation remaining low, the member’s assessment was that, even if the recent weakening of the Korean won worked to increase inflation, there was a growing likelihood of this year’s inflation coming in below 1%, considering the inflation trend so far.",
        "More specifically, the member noted that the remarkable sluggishness in the domestically-generated inflationary pressure indicator and in the price growth of items sensitive to the business cycle implied that the sluggishness of aggregate demand-pull pressures had been driving the slowdown in inflation.",
        "In terms of financial stability, meanwhile, the member evaluated that housing prices had remained on a downward path and household debt growth had continued to slow.",
        "More specifically, the member’s judgment was that group loans and individual mortgage loans had remained stable, but banks’ leasehold deposit loans had maintained strong growth similar to last year, leading total household loan growth.",
        "In terms of leasehold deposit loans, the member presented the view that, since there were policy factors causing increases, such as the exemption from DSR regulations and guarantees by housing guarantee companies, if household debt should be stabilized further, it should be done through macroprudential policy, not monetary policy.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Dongchul Cho expressed clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at its current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Dr. Inseok Shin agreed with keeping the Base Rate unchanged from its current level, but disagreed with the phrase in the Monetary Policy Decision stating that “the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level.” Monetary Policy Decision - The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets has increased.",
        "Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen while the currencies of emerging economies have depreciated, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "- The Board judges that the domestic economy has recovered slightly from its slowdown in the construction investment have continued undergoing adjustments and exports have been sluggish.",
        "On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has lessened while the unemployment rate has increased.",
        "Going forward the Board expects the domestic economy will grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from the path projected in April.",
        "Consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually in the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue.",
        "However, uncertainties concerning the forecast path have risen, chiefly due to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has slightly risen within the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the smaller decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from the second half of this year, but downside risks to the projected path have increased somewhat.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "- The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased, in line mainly with movements in the international financial markets and concerns about economic slowdowns at home and abroad.",
        "Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen significantly while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook for the Second Half of 2019,[2)]_ _FX and_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, looking at the global economy, trade growth had slowed significantly and major countries except the US had shown weaker economic growth, amid the prolongation of uncertainties caused by trade conflicts between major countries and by shifts in their policies.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members judged that interest rates in major countries had continued to decline in expectation of the US Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, while the volatility of major exchange rates had increased.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, along with sluggish exports, facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo adjustments, while private consumption had continued to grow albeit slowly.",
        "Members judged that the Bank of Korea’s downward adjustments to the growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 reflected the situation that the pace of domestic economic growth had been slower than expected.",
        "Members also noted that changes in domestic and external conditions, including growing global economic uncertainties, the global trade slowdown in line with the spread of trade protectionism, and Japan’s export restrictions, could act as downside risks to the growth path.",
        "Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had remained low, running below 1%, due to the combined effects of structural and cyclical factors.",
        "Members forecast demand-side inflation pressures to remain at a low level for the time being.",
        "Finally, as to the domestic financial markets, members saw that market interest rates had fallen significantly and the stock market had been sluggish, but credit market funding conditions had remained stable overall.",
        "Members also judged that, while household debt had been continuing to show slower growth, continued attention should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, while one member argued for holding it at its current level.",
        "One member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.75% to 1.50%.",
        "The member judged that the domestic economy had continued to slow overall since last year.",
        "The member’s diagnosis was that, as the semiconductor industry had continued to go through a correction and the negative spillover effects of shrinking global trade in line with the US-China trade dispute had become apparent, the downward trend of exports had been spreading to other items.",
        "The member evaluated that the worsening of export sluggishness amid already-shrinking domestic demand affected largely by a correction in construction investment had been slowing down growth in the private sector significantly.",
        "In this regard, the member expected the overall economy to remain lackluster for the time being, even when accounting for the government’s active fiscal policy.",
        "In particular, as the trade conflict between Korea and Japan had been intensifying recently, the member’s judgment was that there remained downside risks to the 2019 growth forecast, which the Research Department had adjusted downward this time.",
        "The member also mentioned that the nominal GDP growth rate, representing the rate of growth in the income of all economic agents, had slowed dramatically to 3.1% last year and was forecast to slow much further this year.",
        "In particular, the member expressed concerns that it was difficult to expect the corporate sector to regain its growth momentum for the time being, as its disposable income had declined by more than 5% last year, despite the booming semiconductor industry, and was likely to decrease to a greater extent this year.",
        "The member noted that, in line with the decline in economic activities, consumer price inflation and core inflation had remained in the upper-0% range, far below the target.",
        "Considering that it would be difficult to expect the economy to recover within a short period of time, the member saw only a slight possibility of the current underlying trend of a slowdown in inflation reversing in the second half of this year.",
        "Considering these economic conditions mentioned above, the member stated that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.75% to 1.50%.",
        "Although it was difficult to expect a 0.25 percentage point cut to lead to tangible economic recovery at this point in time, the member expected the rate cut to act as a buffer against further slowdowns in economic activities and inflation that could occur if a Base Rate adjustment were delayed.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that it would be advisable to steadily strengthen prudential policy to prevent moral hazard, thereby reducing potential risk factors in the financial markets that might stem from household debt.",
        "Another member took the view that a shift in the Base Rate policy stance was needed to cope with the changing economic conditions and, in this regard, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate to 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "Looking at the real economy, the member’s assessment was that the slowdown in global trade growth had become a trend while exports and facilities investment had become more lackluster, and as a result, an economic slowdown had become apparent, with the growth rate far below the potential growth rate.",
        "With regard to major economies, the member mentioned that, while the US had maintained relatively favorable growth, the euro area had remained sluggish and Chinese economic growth had been gradually decelerating.",
        "The member added that global trade growth, which affects the Korean economy more directly, had been slowing at a much faster pace than the global real economic trend.",
        "In these external conditions, the member’s evaluation was that Korea’s exports and investment had undergone a wider range of corrections in the first half of this year, leading a slowdown in overall growth.",
        "The member noted that the decline in facilities investment had accelerated to record a two-digit rate of decrease in the first half, and goods exports had reversed to a decrease in terms of both value and volume.",
        "The member also assessed that, as the real economic slump had led to sluggish employment, particularly in the manufacturing sector, household income growth had slowed and heightened uncertainties had dampened household consumer sentiment.",
        "As a result, the member estimated that the lackluster private consumption of the first quarter had continued in the second quarter.",
        "In light of the economic downturn and newly emerging risk factors such as Japan’s export restrictions, the Research Department’s downward adjustment of its previous growth forecast had been inevitable.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member forecast consumer price inflation for this year not to exceed the upper-0% level, given its movements so far and the recent economic trend.",
        "The member expressed the view that Korea’s inflation to date had been affected substantially by factors such as global factors and administered prices that are not closely related to domestic monetary policy.",
        "Taking a more detailed look at the recent inflation, however, the member assessed that a pattern had become more evident: aggregate demand-pull pressures had been sluggish in line with the economic downturn, leading to a slowdown in inflation.",
        "In terms of financial stability, meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that household debt growth had continued to slow.",
        "The member forecast that, although leasehold deposit loans and group loans by the banking sector had remained on the rise, there were no unique factors that would contribute to a further acceleration of household debt growth, and in light of this, it would gradually stabilize downward this year to a level no higher than 5%.",
        "In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that, with domestic demand sluggish in line with a substantial slowdown in global trade, Korea’s real economic downturn was progressing rapidly and inflation was stagnating in the 0% range.",
        "Due to these changes in economic conditions, the member took the view that it was hard to see the current Base Rate level as an accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this regard, the member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate to 1.50% at this meeting.",
        "One other member expressed the view that, in consideration of real economic and inflation trends, it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate to 1.50% at this time.",
        "The member saw that, with respect to the global economy, uncertainties related to trade tensions between major countries and policy changes had lasted for a longer period of time and the growth momentum had been slowing gradually.",
        "The member estimated that the global economic growth rate during the first half of this year had fallen slightly below that of the second half of last year, and pointed out that the differentiation in economic trends by industry should be noted― the non-manufacturing sector and consumption had remained relatively favorable while the manufacturing sector and investment had stayed sluggish.",
        "The member judged that, as uncertainties related to trade disputes had heightened again since May, their negative impacts on global trade and the domestic economy had been increasing substantially.",
        "As to the domestic economy, the member expressed concerns that downside risks to the growth path had increased significantly due to the changes in domestic and external conditions, even though the quarter-on-quarter growth rate was estimated to have shifted to positive in the second quarter.",
        "The member pointed out that the decline in the value of customs-cleared exports had accelerated since May while their volume had also reversed to a decrease, and went on to state that Japan’s export restrictions had the potential to substantially disrupt Korea’s production and exports depending on how the situation developed going forward, and thus it would be necessary to map out and analyze various scenarios concerning potential downside risks.",
        "Next, looking at domestic demand by sector, the member assessed that, while the degree of the contribution of public-sector spending to growth had increased and private consumption had shown modest growth, consumption of durables had been relatively weak and corporate investment had remained lackluster.",
        "The member added that, although month-on-month declines in machinery and construction orders, known to be leading indicators, had been moderating somewhat, there was little possibility that they would recover significantly within a short period of time, considering that domestic and external uncertainties had been large and corporate sentiment had shrunk.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member’s evaluation was that consumer price inflation had remained low at the 0% level in the first half, but with supply-side and one-off factors excluded, underlying inflation had been higher than consumer price inflation.",
        "Given that the negative output gap was likely to widen and limit demand-side pressures, however, the member forecast that consumer price inflation would depart from its 2% target for a longer-than-expected period of time.",
        "Given the aforementioned matters, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.50% at this time.",
        "Looking back at the policy judgments made over the past several months, the member mentioned that, amid uncertainties related to trade disputes, the slope of the medium-term monetary policy path had been gradually adjusted while a rebalancing had been performed in terms of the effects of policy decisions on the growth and inflation paths versus the risk of an accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "However, the member judged that, as trade tensions had heightened again since May and downside risks that had raised concerns had been partly realized or had become more likely to be realized, it would be desirable to adjust the level of the Base Rate downward to buffer downside risks to the growth path and help get inflation back on track.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that continued coordination with other policies would be needed to minimize potential policy costs incident to the Base Rate cut.",
        "The member also emphasized that, since it could not be ruled out that more accommodative financial conditions could cause the degree of the accumulation of financial imbalances to increase again, related risks should be monitored continuously.",
        "The member added that medium- and long-term policy efforts should be strengthened to enhance growth potential, bearing in mind that the prolongation of low interest rates had in many cases weakened corporate restructuring efforts and that the slowdown in Korea’s economic growth had been attributable to several structural problems as well.",
        "One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points from 1.75% to 1.50%, with more focus placed on growth and inflation conditions.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member assessed the sluggishness in exports and investment as having continued, as global growth and trade slowed and the semiconductor business’s recovery was pushed back compared to original expectations.",
        "In the future, the sluggish trend in global trade, stemming for instance from the escalation of the US-China trade dispute, could continue longer than anticipated.",
        "The member added that Japan’s restrictions on exports could also cause setbacks in production and investment in Korea’s core industries.",
        "With respect to prices, the member saw that demand-side inflationary pressures had weakened due to the economic slowdown, while downward pressures from government policy had been sustained.",
        "The member mentioned that, in the financial markets, long-term market interest rates had fallen significantly in reflection of these growth and price conditions.",
        "The member, however, saw that household debt growth was showing signs of expansion of late despite concerns about an economic slowdown, after having previously exhibited a slowing trend, and corporate bond issuance and corporate lending, including lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, had steadily expanded.",
        "The member diagnosed these developments as being contrary to the procyclicality of the financial system in general and assessed that they could serve as positive factors partially easing downward pressures on the economy, but could also be factors requiring continued vigilance in terms of financial imbalances.",
        "The member noted that overall macroeconomic and financial stability conditions had been considered in monetary policy decisions made to date.",
        "The member saw that, since the economic growth rate was forecast to be below its potential level and consumer price inflation to run well below the target level, the need for accommodative monetary policy had grown in terms of macroeconomic conditions.",
        "The member, however, noted that lending to households had expanded again of late, led by bank lending, and housing prices in parts of the Seoul metropolitan region had also been showing signs of a rebound, centering around apartments planned for reconstruction and new presale apartments.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to remain on the alert to risks concerning financial stability.",
        "The member took the view that, although macroeconomic and financial stability conditions had been acting as conflicting considerations for monetary policy decisions, it would be better to lower the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points from 1.75% to 1.50%, with more focus placed on growth and inflation conditions.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that, when cutting the Base Rate, close scrutiny of various risk factors was necessary to prevent a large expansion of financial imbalance risks, which had been cause for concern for some time.",
        "The member also expressed the view that the government and the supervisory authorities should also carry out macroeconomic and housing policies for stabilization of household debt and the housing market in a consistent manner.",
        "The member noted that the sustained low growth of the Korean economy was largely attributable to economic structural factors such as population aging and slower growth in productivity, and thus it was important not only to implement short-term economic stimulus on the monetary and fiscal policy side but also to work to enhance competitiveness and expand growth potential by carrying out structural reforms in all areas of the economy.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to The member assessed that, concerning the global economy, trends of growth in major countries other than the US had been weakening.",
        "The member also diagnosed that instability in the Chinese economy could continue due to prolonged US-China trade negotiations, and the spread of other trade disputes had worked to increase concerns about the global economy.",
        "The member noted that, accordingly, world trade growth had fallen far below original projections.",
        "With respect to the international financial markets, the member pointed out the need for ongoing monitoring, since volatility in major exchange rates had become higher with interest rates in major countries showing a trend of decline due to expectations of accommodative monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, following negative growth in the first quarter, corrections in facilities and construction investment had continued in the second quarter with exports being sluggish.",
        "In particular, the member saw that the real economy had been worse than expected since the beginning of May as the US and China had failed to find a way to reach an agreement in their trade dispute.",
        "The member also pointed out that, although employment was showing improvement due mainly to a base effect, qualitative improvement had been sluggish with continued deterioration in employment conditions in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The member thus presented the view that, although the Research Department had made a large downward adjustment to the economic outlook in consideration of those conditions, there still looked to be downside risks given recent domestic and overseas economic conditions, including the trade issue with Japan.",
        "The member voiced concern that there was still a long way to go before the real economy would show a rapid recovery, particularly due to negative synergy effects of growing uncertainties surrounding the global economy, the export slump stemming from the US-China trade dispute, and the difficulties facing Korea’s IT industry.",
        "The member saw that inflation would remain very low this year, due to low demand-side inflationary pressures amid the combined interactions of structural and cyclical factors.",
        "The member presented the view that, particularly since the output and inflation gaps were both negative, it was necessary to maintain an accommodative monetary policy.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, the member’s assessment was that market interest rates had fallen significantly and the stock market had been somewhat sluggish, due to factors such as the deteriorating performances of Korean companies.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although credit market funding conditions had remained relatively stable, attention should be paid to the herding behavior seen in some credit bond markets.",
        "The member, meanwhile, saw that household debt growth had slowed to around 5%, thanks for instance to strong government measures, and judged that this had been a positive change.",
        "The member expected household debt growth to remain stable overall, although the volume of household debt growth could increase somewhat in the second half of this year compared to the first half.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need to closely monitor the household debt trend in the future as well.",
        "Finally, the member judged that, with the US Federal Reserve highly likely to lower its policy rate in July, concerns about the widening of the interest rate gap between Korea and the US, which had been showing an inversion, could ease to some extent, given a change in the monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve.",
        "With the aforementioned domestic and overseas economic conditions taken into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from 1.75% to One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.75% level at this meeting.",
        "The member saw that, after a temporary rebound in 2017-2018, the world economy looked to have entered a somewhat steep re-correction phase due to the escalation of trade disputes, with the effects of US fiscal policy and the contribution to growth of investment in China weakening.",
        "The member noted that this could also be seen in sluggishness in IT and other manufacturing production.",
        "On the other hand, the member saw that the leading growth drivers for economic activity in major countries still looked to be services and consumption, but presented the view that it was uncertain how long the virtuous circle led by domestic demand would last.",
        "The member noted that major country central banks had been showing movements toward re-expanding their accommodative stances to deal with weakened inflationary pressures.",
        "The member went on to voice concern that this could again stimulate prices of financial and real assets, which had already been high.",
        "The member expected domestic economic growth to continue for some time at a level lower than potential growth, which had shown a trend of decline, as growth was being weighed on by the readjustment of real estate and IT investment, on top of the above-mentioned changes in the global environment.",
        "The member also anticipated inflation to remain low, influenced by weaker demand-side pressures and administered prices.",
        "The member stated that it was necessary to respond to this situation with expansionary macroeconomic policy.",
        "The member, however, noted that the low growth trend was due mainly to domestic and overseas structural factors and readjustment of excess investment, that the narrowing of the current account surplus and the depreciation pressure on the won had appeared simultaneously, and that there still was a risk of financial imbalances.",
        "Given these points, the member took the view that an appropriate mix would be to carry out a large expansionary fiscal policy and to maintain the current level of accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member first expected that if fiscal policy was implemented in line with the budget bill, its contribution to economic growth would rise substantially from last year through direct effects of fiscal spending and indirect effects of tax revenues on consumption.",
        "The member’s assessment was that monetary policy still remained accommodative, in view of abundant market liquidity conditions.",
        "The member commented that even the estimates of proxy indicators of the natural interest rate, such as marginal productivity of capital, confirmed that monetary policy was accommodative.",
        "The member added that this was also reflected well by a calculation of the neutral interest rate using expected inflation or price indexes that better capture demand-side pressures.",
        "The member pointed out that, if the degree of monetary policy accommodation were expanded further in the current situation, the possibility could not be ruled out of the policy effects leaning toward rises in asset prices due to oversupply of liquidity.",
        "The member added that household debt, together with faster growth in the debt of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which had increased greatly for the past ten years, could put downward pressures on potential growth in the medium term.",
        "However, the member pointed out that, despite the risk of financial imbalances, the weakening inflation expectations stemming from persistent low inflation conditions could not be ignored.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, if the trend of decline in inflation expectations continued, which had been ongoing since the end of last year, the relative importance of concerns about the widening of financial imbalances and the decline in inflation expectations should be reconsidered.",
        "The member also emphasized that the global financial and real market trends stemming from changes in the monetary policies of major countries should be closely watched.",
        "Taking into overall consideration the above-mentioned factors, the member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.75% level.",
        "The member added that, with uncertainties surrounding external conditions increasing sharply, the macroeconomic policy mix should be adjusted carefully in the future, while closely watching future developments in the domestic economy, and the flow of private consumption and inflation expectations in particular.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of cutting the Base Rate by Monetary Policy Decision `□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%.",
        "`□` Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow as trade contracted mainly due to the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Global financial markets have been stable in general, with stock prices in major countries increasing in line primarily with expectations of monetary easing in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "`□` The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has slowed as construction investment has continued undergoing an adjustment and the slowdowns in exports and facilities investment have deepened, although consumption has continued to grow moderately.",
        "Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "With respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board expects that the adjustment in construction investment will continue and exports and facilities investment will recover later than originally expected, although consumption will continue to grow.",
        "GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, below the April forecast (2.5%).",
        "`□` Consumer price inflation has remained low at the mid- to upper-0% level, in consequence mainly of the continued decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid- to upper-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the path projected in April and fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from next year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "`□` The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have fallen significantly, in line mainly with concerns about economic slowdowns at home and abroad.",
        "Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated considerably, mainly affected by the US-China trade dispute and Japan’s export restrictions.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend.",
        "`□` Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade dispute, Japan’s export restrictions, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, looking at the global economy, economic slumps in major countries had worsened due to the growing negative spillover effects of the global trade slowdown, and concerns about downside risks to the global economy had been gradually increasing accordingly.",
        "Members evaluated that, in this regard, the US Federal Reserve and major central banks had strengthened their accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment had continued and private consumption growth had slowed slightly.",
        "Members also judged that the sustained effects from worsening external conditions had increased the possibility of the growth rate for this year falling short of the BOK’s July forecast.",
        "Some members expressed the view that, without a recovery in private demand, the economy would remain sluggish for a longer period of time than originally expected.",
        "With regard to consumer prices, members saw that inflation had temporarily recorded a negative figure, amid modest demand-side inflationary pressures combined with the effects of government policies and the base effect from last year’s surge in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that core inflation and other inflation indicators reflecting demand-side inflationary pressures had declined to the lower-1% level, and took the view that attention should be paid to the possibility that the fall in underlying inflation could affect inflation expectations.",
        "Finally, as to household debt, members saw that its growth had slowed owing chiefly to government measures, but judged that attention should be paid to the accelerated rise in unsecured household loans amid the recent hike in housing prices in some regions.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by One member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%.",
        "The member saw that the global trade slowdown, which was causing simultaneous slumps in major economies, had recently been worsening and was lasting longer than expected.",
        "The member also pointed out that the negative impacts of global trade sluggishness had been increasing, particularly in countries heavily dependent on trade.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, as China’s economic indicators had recently been deteriorating even further, it was difficult to rule out the possibility that the global economic slump affected by trade sluggishness could be amplified by the Chinese economic slowdown.",
        "The member judged that, as the global economic environment had been deteriorating further, Korea’s export slump had also been worsening.",
        "The member also noted that, in terms of domestic demand, facilities investment, which is closely related to exports, had remained lackluster and private consumption growth had also remained stagnant at a low level or had even slowed slightly.",
        "The member assessed that, in overall evaluation of recent domestic economic developments and the trend of the environment surrounding the domestic economy, the growth rate for this year was increasingly likely to fall below the Research Department’s July forecast and the risk of the current economic slump being prolonged had risen.",
        "Looking at prices, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation and core inflation had both fallen to the 0% level and that growth both in domestically generated inflationary pressure indicators with administered prices counted out and in prices of items sensitive to business cycles had recently slowed to the lower-1% level.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, although inflation in Korea had been expected to remain low throughout this year, the recent sluggishness of the real economy, inflation, and ultimately the entire economy was increasingly likely to be prolonged.",
        "The member argued that, while inflation had remained short of its target since 2013, core inflation had declined to the 0% level this year, entering a new phase of sluggishness.",
        "The member pointed out that, although public attention had been focused on the recent first-ever recording of negative consumer price inflation, it would be necessary to pay more attention to the steady decline in core inflation, which is seen to better reflect demand-side inflationary pressures and to be linked to inflation expectations in a more stable manner.",
        "The member stated that this sustained and rapid decline in core inflation was unusual, and went on to stress that, since it increased the likelihood of a divergence of inflation expectations from the target, aggressive measures should be taken to manage inflation expectations, which is the ultimate goal of monetary policy.",
        "Looking at current economic conditions in terms of the neutral interest rate, the member judged that, with the potential growth rate continuing to decline, the global trade slowdown had been acting as a shock pulling down the real neutral interest rate.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the accommodative fiscal policy had been acting as a buffer against the real neutral interest rate decline, this would have only a limited effect, considering the sluggish income and inflation indicators.",
        "The member added that the fall in the nominal neutral interest rate could be greater due to the sluggish inflation.",
        "The member evaluated that, in overall consideration of the above, the current level of the Base Rate could be hardly seen as representing an accommodative monetary policy, and in this regard, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.25% for now.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points from the current 1.50% to 1.25%.",
        "Looking at the recent domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member noted that there had been growing concerns about a global economic slowdown, particularly in the manufacturing sector, as world trade growth had slowed significantly affected by the spread of trade protectionism such as the US-China trade dispute and by the weakening of the international division of labor.",
        "The member assessed that, since a deterioration in external conditions could have greater impacts on Korea due to its high economic openness and heavy dependence on exports, downside risks to domestic growth had been increasing.",
        "In terms of inflation, the member judged that, in addition to these demand-side factors, government policies and supply-side factors including agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices had also contributed to the continuation of downward pressures.",
        "The member presented the view that, in consideration of these domestic and foreign economic conditions, it seemed inevitable that the growth and inflation forecasts for this year and the next would be adjusted downward, and in this respect, it would be advisable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, if the Base Rate were cut at the current meeting, it would be consistent with the Bank’s external communications that it would maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance to support recovery of economic growth since the Base Rate cut last July.",
        "However, the member also evaluated that a Base Rate cut in consideration of the macroeconomic side, such as growth and inflation, could further increase the need to pay attention to the financial stability side.",
        "The member mentioned that, since greater borrowing incentives and stronger search for yield under the accommodative financial conditions could add to financial vulnerabilities, it would be necessary to further strengthen the monitoring of domestic flow of funds going forward.",
        "The member also pointed out that, with housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan region shifting to a rise recently, unsecured household loans, which had been less strictly regulated, had been showing faster growth, and went on to stress that the government and the supervisory authorities should play even more important roles in order to stabilize the housing market and household debt and ensure the soundness and resilience of financial institutions.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that not only cyclical factors but also structural factors such as the plunging birth rate, rapid population aging, and slowdown of productivity growth, as well as institutional factors including increased public welfare support to promote the stability of people’s livelihoods had contributed significantly to the prolongation of the low-growth, low-inflation trend, and went on to argue that this could not be resolved by monetary policy measures alone, which are designed to regulate the business cycle.",
        "The member added that, in this respect, it would be crucial to step up aggressive structural reform efforts, and went on to state that fiscal policy should be operated to contribute to stimulating the economy in the short term and also to expanding growth potential and enhancing productivity over the medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate to 1.25% from the current 1.50% at the present time to serve as a buffer against sluggish demand in the private sector and downward pressures on inflation.",
        "The member’s assessment of the domestic economy since the end of last year was that demand in the private sector had stagnated and weak growth dependent on expansion in public sector expenditure was continuing.",
        "The member noted that, in reflection of such sluggish domestic demand, inflation was declining as well.",
        "The member evaluated that the recent negative consumer price inflation seemed a transient phenomenon reflecting the base effect from the surge in agricultural product prices during the same period of last year, but given that core inflation had remained below a clear trend of underlying price inflation deviating from the target and declining over the past two to three years.",
        "The member took the view that it was difficult to be optimistic about future economic conditions.",
        "The member pointed out that there were growing concerns about the global economy due to the signs of an economic slowdown in the US, which had maintained solid growth.",
        "On the domestic front, the member’s judgment was that, since sluggish domestic demand had not shown any sign of recovery, for the time being it would be difficult to expect any significant economic recovery beyond a technical rebound.",
        "The member voiced concern that if the economic sluggishness continued, it could lead to a further decline in underlying price inflation, which would cause a decrease in inflation expectations followed by a rise in the real interest rate, ultimately leading to an economic slump.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that a slowdown in the nominal growth rate following the decline in inflation would make it difficult to maintain tax revenue growth, thereby acting as a major obstacle to expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Accordingly, the member evaluated that it was desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current downward pressures on inflation.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the 1.25% nominal level of the Base Rate could not be assessed to be low under recent macroeconomic conditions with the inflation falling to a historically low level, and that the real interest rate with underlying price inflation excluded remained the highest among major advanced countries.",
        "The member emphasized, meanwhile, that securing economic recovery in the medium- to long-term would require not only short-term macroeconomic policy but also strengthened policy efforts to enhance competitiveness in the private sector.",
        "One member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.50% to 1.25%.",
        "The member stated that downside risks to the world economy had further expanded since the previous MPB meeting.",
        "The member raised the concern that, in the domestic economy, the slowdowns in exports and facilities investment had continued, and private consumption, which had seen modest growth, had recently been showing signs of slowing.",
        "The member presented the view that employment had seen significant improvement of late due mainly to a base effect, but it was too early to feel the effects from such improvement.",
        "Looking at prices, the member’s assessment was that there were growing downside risks to the price outlook, with consumer price inflation recording a negative figure in September.",
        "The member was also concerned that core inflation was running within the 0% range and the trend of decline in inflation expectations was continuing.",
        "The member noted that, for the moment, growth was falling short of the potential rate, which was estimated in the mid-2% range, and consumer prices also remained lower than the target.",
        "The member commented that this showed that low inflationary pressures on the demand side were a major cause of the low inflation.",
        "The member presented the view that, in light of this, there was a need to maintain an accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the slowdown in exports and facilities investment and the worsening of the labor market were attributable more to structural factors, such as the weakened competitiveness of key industries, than to short-term cyclical factors, and thus there would be limits to responding to them through monetary policy.",
        "The member thus emphasized that it would be necessary to make constant efforts to increase the potential growth rate and raise the neutral real interest rate by improving economic fundamentals.",
        "The member saw that, although household debt growth had been slowing due mainly to strong government measures, the already greatly increased debt size could work not only to cause instability in the financial markets, but also to constrain private consumption, thus having negative impacts on the real economy.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that careful attention should be paid in this regard in the future as well.",
        "The member noted that a close watch had been kept on real estate market trends when deciding monetary policy, due to concerns about negative side effects from excessive household debt growth.",
        "The member noted that, if the recent rise in real estate prices in certain regions was not accompanied by a significant increase in household debt, the real estate market would become a less significant consideration for monetary policy, but it was still too early to be optimistic, with some pointing out that demand related to housing purchases was a cause of the recent growth in unsecured household loans.",
        "The member thus added that close monitoring of the relevant developments should continue.",
        "Finally, the member had a positive view with respect to the strengthened accommodative monetary policy stances of central banks of major countries including the US, since they would allow us to focus more on domestic economic sluggishness when making monetary policy decisions.",
        "The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and external economic conditions mentioned above, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate from 1.50% to Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.50% level at this meeting and take more time to closely watch developments related to the economy and inflation.",
        "The member diagnosed that, in the global economy, trade conflicts between major countries and geopolitical risks had been prolonged, while the growth momentum had continued to weaken.",
        "The member evaluated that the growth slowdown had thus far been relatively modest, but the possibility of a more severe slowdown stemming from changes in the policy environments of major countries could not be ruled out.",
        "The member also saw that there had been some positive changes, such as the recent slight weakening of risk aversion in the financial markets and the easing of manufacturing sluggishness in some EMEs.",
        "The member, however, judged uncertainty surrounding the future growth path to remain high, in that these positive trends could change again depending upon how trade conflicts between major countries unfold in the future.",
        "The member evaluated that the concentration of the global growth slowdown in tradable sectors that were closely related to the domestic economy was putting downward pressures on domestic growth.",
        "The member noted that, against this backdrop, the GDP growth rate in Q2 had fallen short of expectations and the recovery of the semiconductor industry was likely to be pushed back further.",
        "The member thus saw that the growth rate for this year was highly likely to fall below the Research Department’s July forecast.",
        "The member, however, noted that some indicators, such as service industry production, consumer sentiment, producer shipments, and facilities investment, had been showing signs of improvement since the last MPB meeting, and thus close attention was being paid to their sustainability.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that, since the domestic and overseas policy environments remained fluid and macro indicators had become more volatile, it was necessary to take a little more time to monitor the relevant indicators to see if the recent developments would lead to meaningful recovery or would be mere one-off events.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that there was heightened concern about the possibility of a widening of the negative inflation gap due to the shift to negative consumer price inflation in September.",
        "The member, however, expected that consumer price inflation would turn positive again from the end of this year onward, when the base effect would weaken.",
        "The member presented the view that, given movements of major asset prices and the counter-cyclicality of the won/dollar exchange rate, it was quite unreasonable to view the recent price decline as a sign of deflation.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that close attention should be paid to the possibility that movements of these headline indexes and inflation expectations could influence each other negatively, since year-on-year consumer price inflation had turned negative for the first time.",
        "In overall consideration of the above, the member judged that, as domestic and overseas policy uncertainties persisted, there still remained a high possibility that the downside risks to growth and inflation that were of concern in the July forecast would be realized.",
        "However, given that a certain degree of downside risk had already been taken into consideration in the course of making the rate-cut decision in July, and most importantly that downside risks had not heightened further since the August meeting while some indicators related to future economic trends were showing signs of change, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to take some time to judge the sustainability of these developments.",
        "Moreover, the member judged that monetary policy at the current level of the Base Rate was sufficiently accommodative, given overall financial conditions, and added that it should also be considered that an expansionary fiscal policy had been adopted.",
        "Accordingly, the member presented the view that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged at 1.50% at the present meeting while future developments in economic activity and prices are further observed.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.50% level at this meeting and maintain the current macroeconomic policy mix.",
        "The member saw that domestic economic growth remained low due to decreased potential growth and negative base effects in the investment sector.",
        "The member assessed that, due to the consequent sluggishness in demand, price inflation was slower than that in major advanced economies, even when one-off supply-side price factors were taken into consideration.",
        "The member thus presented the view that it was appropriate to stimulate demand through a macroeconomic policy more accommodative than other advanced economies, as was currently being done.",
        "However, the member added that, given the risk of financial imbalances, it was necessary to maintain the current policy mix with a focus placed on expansionary fiscal policy, while paying attention to developments in growth and inflation and adjusting the policy mix if necessary.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the recent decline in Korea’s potential growth was attributable to sluggish global manufacturing production and the decline in global trade volume.",
        "The member saw that in the future domestic economic growth would return to the level of potential growth, which had declined, as the base effect gradually dissipated.",
        "The member, however, raised the concern that such a recovery could be pushed back further if the sustainability of private consumption was not secured.",
        "The member noted that a preemptive and more expansionary macroeconomic policy could be considered in the current circumstances.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that caution should be exercised for the moment, since on the monetary policy side there remained a potential risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances, while on the fiscal policy front a long-term plan should first be established to prepare for population aging.",
        "The member diagnosed that financial imbalances were side effects stemming from excessive investment going beyond the level the economy could absorb, due to inappropriate macroprudential regulations in certain sectors or excessive expansionary macroeconomic policy.",
        "The member emphasized that attention should be paid to the points that excessive investment could lead to sluggishness in the capacity utilization ratio and a decline in prices, and that a steep adjustment in financial imbalances caused by domestic and overseas shocks could trigger a financial crisis.",
        "The member noted that a relatively high rate of savings had been maintained in Korea.",
        "The member, however, commented that assets and debt were expanding rapidly and were concentrated in the real estate market.",
        "The member pointed out that, consequently, as the real purchasing power of real estate assets purchased in preparation for population aging continued to decline, the real savings gap was actually widening.",
        "Next, the member assessed that Korea’s fiscal position was relatively sound compared to those of other advanced economies.",
        "The member saw that caution should be exercised in terms of fiscal space, in consideration of the population aging issue.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that it was first necessary to ease the shock from the structural decline in growth and protect vulnerable groups.",
        "Considering the level and mix of macroeconomic policies, the member saw that attention should be paid to the points that unintended policy effects could be easily triggered due to the weakening of economy, and that the recent demand slump was caused by the structural weakening of growth, rather than by cyclical factors.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the present meeting and maintain the current macroeconomic policy mix.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Lee, Il Houng and Dr. Lim, Jiwon expressed clear opposition to cutting the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points and argued for keeping it at the current level.",
        "basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%.",
        "□ Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow as trade has contracted.",
        "The global financial markets have shown high levels of volatility, affected mainly by the uncertainties concerning the US-China trade dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "□ The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued.",
        "Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall below the July projection, owing chiefly to the continued US-China trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation recorded a negative rate, in consequence mainly of the declines in the prices of petroleum products, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and public services.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has fallen to the upper-1% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the path projected in July and fluctuate for some time at around the 0% level, and then run in the □ In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, with major price variables fluctuating considerably due to movements in the global financial markets.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow.",
        "Housing prices have remained steady overall but have risen in Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while observing any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions and the effects of the two Base Rate cuts.",
        "It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (November 2019),[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, looking at the global economy, the paces of economic growth in major countries excluding the US had continued to slow due to the ongoing slump in world trade.",
        "Members expected the global economy to improve during the next year compared to the current year, but saw that a substantial rebound was unlikely due to high uncertainties surrounding the growth path.",
        "Meanwhile, members evaluated that, in the international financial markets, risk aversion had somewhat subsided due to progress in the US-China trade negotiations and expectations related to the accommodative monetary policies of major advanced economies.",
        "Members diagnosed that the domestic economy had been showing weaker-than-expected growth, as the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment had continued and private consumption growth had continued to slow.",
        "With respect to growth trends for next year, some members expressed the view that domestic demand and exports were unlikely to show meaningful recovery, while others expected the negative output gap to narrow to some extent since some indicators had been showing signs of improvement.",
        "With regard to prices, members pointed out that consumer price inflation and core inflation both were at low levels, around the 0% range.",
        "Members saw that consumer price inflation would rebound somewhat, due to the easing of downward pressures stemming from one-off factors, but a fundamental reversal of the decline in core inflation did not seem likely given economic conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, some members raised concerns about the possibility of low inflation affecting inflation expectations.",
        "Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members’ evaluation was that bank lending rates had declined and credit in the private sector had expanded, led by corporate credit, although long-term market interest rates had risen since the last MPB meeting.",
        "Members saw that the expansion in liquidity could cause negative side effects such as increased investment in high-risk assets and instability in the real estate market.",
        "Members thus saw the need to keep a close eye on the possibility of financial imbalances accumulating.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%, while one member called for lowering it by 25 basis points.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting and take more time to closely watch real economic trends and domestic and international financial market conditions.",
        "The member evaluated that, in the global economy, trends of economic growth in major countries excluding the US had continued to slow, and trade had also remained sluggish since the last MPB meeting.",
        "The member noted that, in the international financial markets, interest rates and stock prices had risen, in reflection of expectations related to accommodative monetary policies in major advanced economies amid progress in the US-China trade negotiations.",
        "The member evaluated that, while exports and facilities investment remained sluggish, construction investment continued to undergo a correction and private consumption was showing signs of a slowdown.",
        "With respect to prices, the member pointed out that core inflation had continued the trend of decline and the rate of inflation expected by the general public was running below 2%.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, since the slower domestic growth was significantly attributable to global economic factors, the question of whether the global economy would show improvement next year was important for the domestic economy.",
        "On the upside, the member pointed to expectations of improvement in the global economy next year led by semiconductors.",
        "The member, however, saw that a meaningful rebound was not expected for now, since several uncertainties, such as the US-China trade dispute and the slowdown of the Chinese economy, were unlikely to be resolved easily.",
        "The member noted that price conditions would also show improvement compared to the current year, but raised the concern that consumer price inflation and core inflation could still be significantly below the target.",
        "The member’s assessment was that monetary policy should remain accommodative going forward, given that weak inflationary pressures on the demand side were one of the major causes of the low inflation.",
        "The member also noted that there was growing interest as to how effectively monetary policy might be able to respond to sluggish exports and facilities investment.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for in-depth analyses on several issues related to monetary policy, such as monetary policy transmission mechanism and the effective lower bound.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, although the slowing of household debt growth had continued thanks to strong government measures, careful attention should be paid in the future to the possibility that rising real estate prices in some regions would act to increase household debt.",
        "The member also noted that corporate lending growth had expanded, following the government measures to curb household debt.",
        "The member went on to express the view that constant monitoring was required as to whether the growing corporate lending was flowing into sectors related to the real estate market.",
        "The member added that it should be carefully examined whether the sustained low interest rate environment would generate negative side effects, such as exacerbated corporate insolvencies or delayed restructuring of distressed companies.",
        "The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and external economic conditions mentioned above, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current domestic and international financial market conditions.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to revise the Base Rate downward, but the revision should be deferred to the next meeting.",
        "The member’s assessment of the domestic economy was that demand in the private sector had stagnated and weak growth dependent on expanded public sector expenditure was continuing.",
        "The member anticipated that, in a broad sense, this pattern would continue next year as well.",
        "The member noted that, given that global growth had been modest, it would be difficult to expect exports and facilities investment in Korea to drive a real economic recovery next year that went beyond a technical rebound.",
        "Turning to specific industries, the member noted that, while most industry-related indicators remained sluggish, construction-related leading indicators in particular implied that the decline in construction investment would continue for the third consecutive year in that, given the modest growth in households’ disposable incomes, the possibility of significantly expanded growth in private consumption was not high.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member stated that the government’s active fiscal expansion would continue to act as a buffer against a decline in the growth rate next year as well.",
        "The member, however, expected the negative output gap to actually expand, as the overall growth rate of the domestic economy would run below the potential level, which was estimated at the mid-2% range.",
        "Accordingly, the member pointed out that a years-long trend of decline in underlying price inflation could continue next year as well.",
        "The member saw that, although consumer price inflation, which remained at around 0%, would likely rebound slightly due to one-off technical factors, macroeconomic variables such as the output gap, inflation expectations, and overseas inflation were mostly acting to lower price inflation.",
        "Given this point, the member assessed that it would not be easy to expect a reversal from a trend of decline in core inflation, which had fallen to the upper-0% range.",
        "The member noted that, given this underlying price inflation, it was difficult to assess the current 1.25% Base Rate as sufficiently accommodative on a real interest rate basis.",
        "The member thus stated the position that it was desirable to revise the Base Rate downward to keep up with the current macroeconomic conditions.",
        "The member, however, noted that a downward revision should be deferred to the next meeting to respect the intent conveyed in the last Monetary Policy Decision statement to observe the effects of the two Base Rate cuts.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to conduct policy based on the market economy principle in order to strengthen the competitiveness in the private sector in the medium- to long-term, and to enhance the effects of boosting the real economy in the short-term through a reduction of the negative side effects of accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member noted that prices had declined remarkably in 2019 due to a deepening of the domestic demand slump, after having had shown low growth for the last few years influenced by global factors and administered prices.",
        "The member, however, cautiously judged that prices had bottomed out overall, with various indicators such as core inflation excluding administered prices showing slight rebounds of late.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the current year’s sluggish domestic demand was attributable to a rapid decline in growth on top of the already declining potential growth rate stemming from a readjustment of excessive investment.",
        "The member commented that low real estate investment and facilities investment were in a way desirable in that they had partially resolved the excessive investment of recent years, but they were also undermining growth in the short term.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the sluggish domestic demand was mainly attributable to structural factors at home and abroad, but given the stability of economic activity, the currently implemented expansionary fiscal policy and the recent two Base Rate cuts were sufficient policy responses.",
        "The member noted that the domestic economy was expected to recover to some extent to the level of potential growth rate next year, as the readjustment to investment would be completed.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that downward inflationary pressures and sluggish domestic demand would continue due to a sustained decline in the potential growth rate, and in response the urgent task at the present moment was to pursue structural reforms that could reverse the trend of decline in the potential growth rate, rather than pursue a more expansionary macroeconomic policy.",
        "The member noted that, to ensure seamless structural reforms, it was appropriate to supplement growth with fiscal policy first, while maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance and keeping an eye on the policy effects.",
        "The member added that it was desirable to formulate monetary policy from a medium-term perspective to make the allocation of resources efficient and prevent unnecessary expansion of economic volatility.",
        "The member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it was necessary to consider how to cope with financial imbalances, which were one of the factors causing a reduction in the potential growth rate.",
        "The member noted that deadweight losses stemming from financial imbalances could be seen from small- and medium-sized enterprises’ increased dependence on debt, from the excessive value of real estate as production capital relative to total production capacity, and from increases in unsold housing units in provincial areas and commercial building vacancy rates.",
        "The member noted that any rapid adjustment in the financial imbalances stemming from domestic or external shocks could trigger a financial crisis through mismatches on balance sheets of financial institutions, and mentioned that this was a financial stability issue that required continued attention.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, since financial imbalances had worsened further since the global financial crisis, they had emerged as an issue to consider even from a monetary policy perspective.",
        "The member explained that this was because an expansion in deadweight losses stemming from financial imbalances could act as downward inflationary pressures, by causing the potential growth rate to decline and thus leading to sluggish domestic demand.",
        "The member added that, from this perspective, attention should be paid to the point that, since the financial crisis, major advanced economies had witnessed somewhat reduced financial imbalances due to strong implementation of deleveraging despite steep cuts in interest rates, while some emerging economies including Korea had seen substantial increases in leverage during the same period.",
        "Considering the matters mentioned above, the member found the current macroeconomic policy mix and stance to be appropriate.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 1.25% level.",
        "One member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to The member’s assessment of the domestic economy was that the economic slump and inflation sluggishness since the end of last year had continued.",
        "The member pointed out that the rapid slowdown in global trade, the biggest factor responsible for the economic downturn, had been negatively affecting exports, corporate facilities investment, and ultimately the overall expectations of economic agents.",
        "The member mentioned that the US-China trade dispute had been widely cited around the end of last year as a factor behind this global trade slowdown, but considering that global trade had been slowing at an unprecedentedly rapid pace until recently and that the auto and IT industries had been leading the slowdown, the reorganization of the world supply chain known as the GVC could be a fundamental cause.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although global trade was expected to improve next year, boosted at the minimum by a technical rebound, fundamental changes in Korea’s export environment and related facilities investment environment still appeared unlikely, on the assumption of sustained structural changes such as the reorganization of the GVC.",
        "The member evaluated that, when external demand slows, the relative contribution of household consumption to growth should rise theoretically and serve as a buffer against the economic downturn, but such volatility-reducing dynamics of consumption had not been seen recently in the domestic economy.",
        "The member noted that, despite the substantial increase in the government’s transfer payments, the decline in household consumption growth has not been eased.",
        "The member expressed the view that this had also been witnessed during the period of economic downturn around 2012 and seemed to be related with population aging, a structural factor of the Korean economy.",
        "The member’s forecast was that, with the economy’s potential growth rate expected to decline due to population aging, a rapid economic slowdown like the one seen this year would lead a substantial number of households to make downward adjustments to their future income forecasts.",
        "The member also took the view that advanced countries had experienced a sharp drop in the propensity to consume at around retirement age, and the fact that the baby boomer generation, which accounts for a substantial share of households in Korea, was approaching retirement could be a factor causing household consumption to contract.",
        "In this regard, the member forecast that consumption was highly likely to remain stagnant for a considerable period of time after an economic slump, as witnessed in 2012.",
        "Considering these domestic and external conditions, the member expected the domestic economy to exhibit growth of a maximum of 2% this year and remain on a growth path not deviating far from this level.",
        "The member forecast that, as a result, the output gap for this year and next would be at its most sharply negative level since 2012 and Looking at inflation, the member pointed out that consumer price inflation had remained in the lower-0% range and core inflation in the mid- to upper-0% range, and judged that there would be more downside risks than upside risks in the outlook for next year, considering economic conditions and the inflation trend.",
        "The member noted that it would be hard to expect core inflation, considered to be more stably linked to inflation expectations, to shift back to an increasing trend next year, and argued that the current challenge for monetary policy would be that, with inflation unanchored from the 2% target for a long time, inflation expectations could decline further due to the current economic slump.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although there was only a slight possibility that the domestic economy would enter deflation any time soon, there was a substantial probability that inflation would become entrenched below 1%.",
        "The member emphasized that, in this case, attention should be paid to the possibility of the real Base Rate with inflation taken into consideration exceeding the real neutral interest rate even when the Base Rate was maintained at a low level, and this could undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy through conventional policy rate adjustments.",
        "In terms of the neutral interest rate, the member’s judgment was that, in light of the recent economic conditions and the outlook for next year, Korea’s recent real neutral interest rate seemed to have declined at a somewhat rapid pace, exceeding the pace of decrease in the potential growth rate.",
        "The member also took the view that, given the inflation outlook, it would be hard to consider the real interest rate suggested by the current Base Rate as being lower than the real neutral interest rate, despite the previous two Base Rate cuts, and it would be difficult to assess the current monetary policy as sufficiently accommodative.",
        "The member argued that, in this regard, more aggressive monetary policy measures were required and it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.00%.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%.",
        "Looking at global economic and financial conditions since the previous monetary policy decision meeting, the member assessed that, although growth rates had been slowing, particularly in China and the euro area, risk-off sentiment in the financial markets had eased substantially.",
        "The member mentioned that this was a result of the judgment that the policies of major countries were moving toward a direction that would ease downward pressures on the growth path, and of expectations that an environment was being created in which the manufacturing slump would be gradually eased.",
        "The member argued, however, that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high, owing to geopolitical risks as well as the lack of agreements in trade talks between major countries.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the growth rate of the domestic economy continued to be on a downward trend due to various structural factors, but downward pressures stemming from cyclical factors were seen to have been easing somewhat.",
        "Looking at recent economic indicators, the member noted that some leading indicators for the manufacturing industry had been exhibiting gradual improvement and the services industry had been showing more favorable movements than in the first half of this year, which supported expectations that the economic slowdown would not worsen further due to cyclical factors.",
        "However, the member argued that, considering the protracted corrections in the construction sector and the continued state of flux in the domestic and overseas policy environments, which would affect the future growth path, more time for observation was needed to judge whether the recent trend would lead to a more significant recovery and a narrowing of the negative output gap.",
        "With respect to consumer price inflation, the member forecast that the gap between consumer price inflation and underlying inflation would gradually narrow with the easing of supply-side downward pressures, but that consumer price inflation would remain below the target for a considerable period of time, affected by weak demand-side inflation pressures and an expansion in social-welfare policy.",
        "In this regard, the member presented the view that it would be necessary to observe closely how this inflation trend would affect the formation of inflation expectations going forward.",
        "Regarding the financial markets, meanwhile, the member mentioned that, while long-term market interest rates had risen since August, financial institutions’ loan rates, which play a more leading role in credit supply to the corporate sector, had declined, leading to a sharp rise in corporate lending and to an expansion in liquidity.",
        "The member pointed out that, although this suggested that monetary policy transmission channels are working smoothly in the financial markets, continued attention should be paid to the possibility of the accumulation of financial imbalances that could be brought about by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned points, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25%.",
        "Looking at the recent domestic economy, the member evaluated that the pace of growth was slower than originally expected, as exports and investment had remained sluggish and the rate of growth in private consumption had slowed.",
        "The member noted that inflation had been lower than originally forecast, affected largely by these demand-side factors and the strengthening of the government’s social-welfare policy.",
        "The member stated that in November the Research Department was adjusting the outlooks for the growth rate and consumer price inflation downward for this year and next, and took the view that this had been expected to some extent at the October meeting.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, according to these economic outlooks, the trend of low growth and low inflation would last, although the growth rate and consumer price inflation would bottom out this year and gradually rise next year and the year after.",
        "The member argued that this trend seemed to have resulted substantially from structural factors of the domestic economy as well as common global factors, but the forecast that inflation would remain below the target should be taken seriously by a central bank operating an inflation targeting regime.",
        "The member stressed that, as short-term inflation expectations of the general public, unlike long-term inflation expectations of experts, had been recently declining gradually in reflection of the low inflation trend, efforts should be made to strengthen communication concerning inflation conditions so that the credibility of monetary policy would not be undermined.",
        "The member meanwhile evaluated that the transmission mechanism of Base Rate cuts seemed to be working smoothly in the financial markets, as deposit and lending rates had declined and credit to the private sector and liquidity had continued to increase significantly since the two Base Rate cuts.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that the recent growth in credit supply and liquidity had worked to increase investment in high-risk, high-return products and had served as a factor causing housing market instability in some regions rather than stimulating real economic activities such as consumption and investment.",
        "The member argued that this was a cause for concern from the standpoint of both the sound development and medium- and long-term stability of the national economy.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, given the Base Rate cut last month in expectation of downward adjustments of the growth and inflation forecasts and the highly accommodative credit and liquidity conditions seen recently, it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economic growth has continued to slow as trade has contracted.",
        "The global financial markets have been stable in general, as risk aversion has subsided in line mainly with progress in the US-China trade negotiations.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued.",
        "Employment conditions have continued to improve in some respects, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy during next year, the Board expects the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment will ease somewhat and the consumption growth rate will moderately rise, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue.",
        "GDP is forecast to grow at around 2% in 2019 and the lower-2% level in 2020. of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the upper-1% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that during next year consumer price inflation will moderately increase to around risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, affected chiefly by movements in the global financial markets.",
        "The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow.",
        "Housing prices have risen as the pace of increase has expanded in Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while carefully monitoring developments in the US-China trade negotiations, the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks and examining their effects on domestic macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.",
        "After briefings by staff on “Economic Outlook for 2019[2)],” “FX and International Finance Trends,” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that there were growing concerns about downside risks to the global economy, particularly with respect to the euro area and Chinese economies.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members mentioned that volatility of major price variables such as stock prices and exchange rates had seen sharp increase in December last year, but had been generally stable since the beginning of this year in line chiefly with changing expectations about the US-China trade negotiations and the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the domestic economy had sustained growth centering around exports and consumption, while facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo corrections.",
        "The members forecast the domestic economy to grow by 2.6 percent this year and next, with the contribution of fiscal expenditure to growth likely to increase, and mentioned that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path were high, due mainly to changes in monetary and trade policies―particularly in the US―and concerns about a possible Chinese economic slowdown.",
        "Concerning inflation, members forecast consumer price inflation at 1.4 percent for this year and 1.6 percent for next year, in reflection of supply-side factors such as the decline in international oil prices and increased downward pressures on administered prices in line with the government’s strengthening of its welfare policy, amid small demand-side inflation pressures.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that the volatility in the stock market had expanded in December last year but then stabilized overall this year, and capital flows and the won-dollar rate had also shown stability.",
        "Members pointed out that household debt growth was slowing gradually but continued to outpace income growth, and thus it would be necessary to remain vigilant.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member stated that there had been no significant changes in domestic economic trends since the previous MPB meeting, concerns remained about the possibility of financial imbalances accumulating, and uncertainties surrounding domestic and external conditions were high, and therefore it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting and closely examine future developments.",
        "The member noted that the growth and inflation forecasts had been adjusted downward, but judged that there had been no major changes to the overall macroeconomic trends, as the growth rate was unlikely to deviate far from its potential level and the inflation forecast was being affected chiefly by supply-side factors and the strengthening of welfare policy.",
        "The member mentioned, however, that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high, considering various domestic and external factors including US-led changes in monetary and trade policies, the slowdown in Chinese economic growth, political risks in major countries, sluggish domestic employment, and the contraction of private-sector economic sentiment.",
        "The member assessed that domestic and overseas financial markets had seen sharp increases in major price variable volatility in December last year, but had been generally stable since the beginning of this year in line chiefly with changing expectations about the US-China trade negotiations and the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member took the view that household debt growth would likely continue to slow this year, affected largely by stronger regulations, housing market sluggishness, and the previous Base Rate hike.",
        "The member added, however, that it would be necessary to remain cautious about the possibility of financial imbalances accumulating due to rising household debt, as demand for leasehold deposit loans and collective loans would likely be strong, owing mainly to a rise in the number of move-in ready apartments.",
        "In conclusion, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting and keep an eye on future developments, and went on to argue that it would be desirable to carefully decide whether to further adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation after comprehensively evaluating economic growth and inflation trends as well as changes in financial stability risks, based on economic indicators.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting, while keeping a close watch on real economic developments, the household lending trend, and international financial market developments.",
        "The member assessed that economic agents’ concerns had increased significantly due to the sustained policy uncertainties in major countries and the increased financial market volatility since the previous MPB meeting, and judged that, although this could cause domestic and global economies to slow further, there remained only a limited possibility of growth rate adjustments leading to a full-fledged downturn in the near future.",
        "The member noted that attention should be paid to the favorable growth sustained in advanced countries, based on improvements in employment conditions, and to expanded stimulus measures, particularly in EMEs with relatively favorable external soundness.",
        "Furthermore, the member noted positively that risk aversion had somewhat eased with anxiety about the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes having been substantially reduced recently and US-China trade negotiations having resumed.",
        "On the other hand, the member pointed out that if uncertainties involving the US-China trade negotiations, the US government shutdown, and Brexit continued for a longer period of time, they could act as additional downside risks to the growth path.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member mentioned that there were significant uncertainties surrounding the medium- and long-term growth forecasts, as the global economic slowdown had been concentrated in regions and sectors where Korean exports are highly dependent on, while various changes had been made to domestic microeconomic policy.",
        "However, the member assessed the degree of adjustment in exports as somewhat excessive, since the recent plunge in customs-cleared exports had been attributable mainly to technical factors, including declines in export unit prices affected by semiconductor and oil prices and the impacts of export volume adjustments prior to tariff hikes in major countries.",
        "The member added that a more accommodative fiscal policy would be underway this year, enhancing the contribution of fiscal expenditure to growth.",
        "The member forecast that consumer price inflation might run below the current level for some time, affected by international oil prices and administered prices, but is likely to rebound to near the mid- to upper-1 percent level in the medium term, considering movements of prices of items less affected by one-off and policy factors and given the Bank of Korea Research Department’s forecast that Korea’s economic growth would not diverge significantly from its potential level this year.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the member took the view that the current slowing trend, albeit slight, of household debt growth would likely continue, as the effects of strengthened micro-level regulations had started to materialize and were combined with the effects of the reduction in the degree of monetary easing, but continued vigilance would be necessary as household debt growth had continued to outpace income growth and demand for household loans was likely to be substantial amid a rise in the number of move-in ready apartments.",
        "As to financial markets, meanwhile, the member evaluated that, although stock price volatility had increased immensely, capital flows and the won-dollar exchange rate had been relatively stable, boosted by favorable external soundness indicators, and went on to mention that the possibility of greater financial market volatility should be closely monitored in consideration of high uncertainties concerning policies in major countries.",
        "In overall consideration of the factors mentioned above, the member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting and take more time to observe economic and inflation trends and global financial market conditions.",
        "One other member noted that, while the outlook for economic growth this year had been revised slightly downward, there had been some positive changes on the financial stability side.",
        "The member thus took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.75 percent level at the current meeting, while closely monitoring changes in US monetary policy and economic conditions, as well as trends in the domestic real economy.",
        "With respect to the global economy, the member evaluated that it was still showing growth at the level of the potential growth rate, despite increasing concerns about downside risks since the October forecast last year.",
        "The member added that, despite these real economic conditions, the financial markets seemed to have responded quite sensitively in December.",
        "As for the US economy, the member noted that the real economy was showing sound growth, despite sluggish survey indicators, and stated that it was important to assess US economic conditions and analyze financial market trends.",
        "The member also saw the need for close monitoring of the European economy, which had been somewhat sluggish, and of the Chinese economy, whose growth was expected to slow, adding that attention should be paid to international oil prices and global trade flows.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member saw that, although private consumption had remained relatively stable, adjustments to facilities investment and construction investment had continued, and growth in exports was forecast to be slower this year than last year.",
        "The member expected an upturn in the semiconductor industry from the second half of this year, and anticipated that the shipbuilding sector, which had partially started to recover, would supplement exports and investment, albeit to a limited extent.",
        "The member predicted that employment conditions would be better than last year, but the pace of recovery would be moderate.",
        "As difficulties in some industries were highly likely to continue despite government policies, the member noted that close monitoring should continue.",
        "The member assessed that, in light of the economic outlook presented by Bank of Korea’s Research Department, the GDP gap was estimated to remain slightly negative.",
        "The member noted that the ongoing decline in economic indicators and the weakness in sentiment indicators would weigh on the future Korean economy.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that the government sector was expected to compensate somewhat for the weakening of economic growth this year, just like last year.",
        "The member also stated the view that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained, as demand-side inflationary pressures seemed likely to be mild in the future as well.",
        "With respect to financial stability, the member assessed that there had been some positive changes, such as somewhat diminished stock market volatility and slowing household debt growth, influenced for instance by suggestions that the US Federal Reserve would adjust the pace of its policy rate hikes.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that the effects of government measures should be examined and the relevant developments should be monitored, since household debt growth still exceeded household income growth.",
        "Last, the member noted that a prolongation or widening of the inversion of the US and Korean policy rates could add to market volatility in the long run, and therefore it was necessary to constantly examine the US Federal Reserve’s movements toward monetary policy normalization as well.",
        "In overall consideration of the factors mentioned above, the member judged that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 1.75 percent level, while reviewing developments in the real economy and financial stability conditions.",
        "One member noted that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained due to weak inflationary pressures, and the financial imbalances that had been built up should be dealt with.",
        "The member thus presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 1.75 percent at the current meeting, while continuing to examine the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.",
        "With respect to the global economy, the member judged that it had temporarily rebounded, led by the US economy, but had then approached its potential rate of growth, which was somewhat weaker than in the past due to various structural issues.",
        "The member saw a heightened possibility that global economic growth could weaken, as the scope for macroeconomic policy adjustment in EMEs had narrowed and global trade growth had slowed in the course of US monetary policy normalization.",
        "The member, however, assessed that financial markets had remained stable overall and global dollar liquidity conditions had remained favorable.",
        "The member saw that Korea’s economic growth was gradually approaching its potential level, as real estate-related construction investment and IT-related facilities investment had undergone adjustments after showing strong growth for the past years.",
        "The member commented that the potential growth rate was judged to have declined to the mid-2 percent range or slightly above due to structural problems at home and abroad, including a decrease in the working-age population.",
        "The member noted that the Korean economy was sustaining a trend of growth led by exports and consumption, despite huge investment adjustments.",
        "The member saw that exports were maintaining strong competitiveness, thanks to some industries such as the IT sector.",
        "The member also commented that private consumption was maintaining relatively solid growth, boosted by ongoing income improvements and increased government transfer payments and welfare spending, although sentiment indicators had been sluggish.",
        "The member went on to explain that fiscal policy had positively affected private consumption and growth by strengthening redistribution, although the government had shifted to a tightening stance as tax revenues grew faster than fiscal spending in 2018.",
        "Looking at prices, the member noted that the sticky price index and inflation with food and energy product prices excluded stood at the lower-2 percent range and the mid-1 percent range respectively, both with administered items excluded, which was a better indicator of demand pressures than the CPI.",
        "On the other hand, the member added that core inflation was only in the lower-1 percent range due to sluggishness in administered items, leasehold deposits, monthly rental payments, and industrial products.",
        "The member expected core inflation to remain flat in the lower- to mid-1 percent range, due to weak demand-side pressures, slower growth in housing rents, and low rises in the export and import prices of global industrial products and in public service prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed that the accumulation of financial imbalances had been easing, as the government’s various regulatory policy measures had led to slower growth in real estate-related lending and a trend of decline in housing prices.",
        "The member, however, expressed the need for keeping a close eye on the accumulation of financial imbalances, as the over-concentration of capital in the real estate sector was continuing through sole proprietor loans, and the demand for loans was likely to continue to some extent because this year’s supply of new housing was expected to be higher than in past years.",
        "The member noted that the process of resolving accumulated financial imbalances could weigh on growth in the short term, but this would lay a foundation to further consolidate Korea’s economic fundamentals over the medium-term horizon.",
        "The member noted that inflationary pressures were forecast to remain at their current (albeit weak) level, but it would likely be difficult for domestic demand pressures to offset exogenous downward pressures on prices and bring inflation up to its target.",
        "The member thus found it necessary to maintain the current accommodative stance.",
        "On the other hand, the member noted that there was a possibility of a widening of financial imbalances, and there was also a need for a gradual resolution of imbalances accumulated thus far.",
        "The member thus found it desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75 percent at this meeting, while keeping a close watch on economic conditions in the future and assessing the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level while closely examining future macroeconomic trends, given that growth momentum in the private sector was weak and prices remained low.",
        "The member stated that real GDP growth stood at 2.7 percent last year, but nominal GDP growth, an indicator of the actual national income, was estimated to be only around 3 percent, the lowest since the Asian Financial Crisis.",
        "The member thus judged the degree of actual value added in the economy to be very low.",
        "The member added that, by sector, government income growth was estimated to greatly exceed 3 percent, while that in the corporate sector was significantly lower than 3 percent.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the government’s direct consumption had surged and private consumption had also maintained its trend of growth, led by health care and social welfare services where fiscal support had been expanding.",
        "The member, however, judged that business conditions had been sluggish in the areas of the private sector not directly linked with fiscal support, and with respect to the labor market as well there was little meaningful employment growth to be found in the private service sector apart from health care and social welfare.",
        "The member presented the view that growth in the private sector was unlikely to gain further momentum in the short term in view of the economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The member noted that the more moderate expansion of the world economy, particularly in Europe and China, had led to a gradual slowdown of the export growth that had been contributing greatly to the domestic expansion for a year, while investment-related indicators did not suggest the possibility of an investment recovery in the short term.",
        "The member, however, commented that the large contribution of fiscal spending to growth was highly likely to continue in view of the government’s plan for active fiscal policy.",
        "The member noted that core inflation had remained weak in the lower-1 percent range for over a year, and even when prices of administered items were excluded, the inflation estimate stood in the mid-1 percent range.",
        "The member’s assessment was that overall consumer price inflation was converging to the level of core inflation in the lower- to mid-1 percent range, as one-off factors were diminishing.",
        "Considering recent employment and economic conditions, the member saw little likelihood of a rapid acceleration of core inflation in the short term, and expected overall consumer prices to fluctuate at around the level of core inflation.",
        "The member took the view that, given the aforementioned environment, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level, while keeping a close watch on the direction of macroeconomic changes in the future.",
        "The member also presented the view that it was necessary to assess the degree to which active fiscal policy would compensate for the lack of private demand, whether self-driven recovery momentum in the private sector would materialize, and whether aggregate demand from the private and government sectors would expand to the extent that low price inflation would converge toward its target.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level at the present meeting, as the impacts of negative external conditions such as slower real indicators in China were gradually appearing in the Korean economy, and inflationary pressures remained weak.",
        "Concerning the recent state of Korea’s real economy, the member’s assessment was that, with negative developments in the external environment continuing, the trend of domestic growth was also weakening somewhat, with recovery in private consumption slowing.",
        "On the international front, the member noted that US real indicators were generally showing favorable movements, but unrest had increased greatly, especially in financial markets.",
        "The member also commented that the euro area had witnessed a trend of slower growth, while China had seen significant deterioration in all real economic indicators for the past two months.",
        "The member took the view in particular that the shift to a decline in Chinese exports last December had been working to increase downside risks to the growth paths of the world economy and trade.",
        "The member noted that, in line with developments in the external environment, Korean exports had shown favorable movements until October last year but then saw slower growth in November on a customs clearance basis and shifted to a decline in December, showing a pattern similar to exports in China.",
        "The member commented that the recent large declines in prices of semiconductors and petrochemical products, Korea’s two main export items, had created a gap between the export value on a customs clearance basis and the export volume.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the decrease in the contribution of exports to real growth would be smaller than the decrease in export value but still considerable.",
        "Looking at domestic demand, the member noted that private consumption had shown 2.8 percent growth last year, stronger than GDP growth.",
        "The member went on to mention that consumption growth had exceeded GDP growth for the first time since 2010.",
        "The member saw that as the trend of decline in the household propensity to consume had ended in 2017, household consumption growth had technically rebounded, but the propensity to consume had failed to return to past levels.",
        "The member thus took the view that there was uncertainty as to whether private consumption growth, which had been robust for the past year, would remain high.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, given the recent developments in the world economy and real indicators related to domestic demand, the adjusted forecast prepared by Bank of Korea’s Research Department seemed to have some degree of downside risk.",
        "The member, however, noted that the ongoing strong growth in government spending since last year could serve as a substantial buffer against slower growth in aggregate demand in the private sector.",
        "Concerning prices, the member argued that, in view of slower growth in the real economy, it would be difficult to expect inflationary pressures to rise this year as well.",
        "The member went on to express the view that the Research Department’s adjusted forecasts, revised downward to 1.4 percent for both core inflation and CPI this year, were more consistent with actual price conditions.",
        "The member noted that, taking these points into overall consideration, there were great uncertainties surrounding the external environment, real economic growth was slowing somewhat, and inflation remained low.",
        "The member thus took the view that it was appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled and was approved unanimously by the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has slowed somewhat.",
        "The volatilities in the global financial markets, which had previously expanded, have diminished slightly this year, in line mainly with the possibility of the US Federal Reserve adjusting the pace of its rate hikes and with expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit.",
        "- The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth at its potential level generally, as the increases in consumption and exports have been sustained, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have continued.",
        "Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the amount of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened substantially in December.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall slightly short of the path projected in October, but to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level thanks to increased government expenditures for example.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has slowed to the lower-1% level, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and reductions in the extents of increase in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the lower-1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate at the 1% level for some time and then steadily increase to the mid-1% level in the second half of this year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "- The domestic financial markets saw increased volatility in December last year, but have been generally stable since the beginning of this year.",
        "Stock prices had fallen, in line mostly with concerns about the global economic slowdown, but have rebounded on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute for example.",
        "Long-term market interest rates, after a decline, have been fluctuating slightly.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has been generally stable while moving within a narrow range.",
        "The amount of increase in household lending has diminished, while housing prices have continued to slow.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."

    "2021": [
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: All members predicted that the domestic economy would show growth generally consistent with the previous forecast.",
        "Members, however, judged that uncertainties related to COVID-19 were still high.",
        "Looking at specific sectors, members expected exports and facilities investment to maintain their trends of improvement, thanks to recovery in the semiconductor industry, although private consumption was showing sluggishness, influenced by stronger social-distancing measures.",
        "Some members, however, pointed out that there was a possibility that the recovery could be illusory due to the semiconductor industry and skewed growth between sectors could intesify, as the real economic recovery would be led by certain industries such as automobiles and semiconductors.",
        "Members also raised the concern that, even if employment conditions recovered in the future after having severely worsened due to COVID-19, it could take considerable time to make up for the job losses which heavily impacted vulnerable groups.",
        "Members saw that, although inflation would increase further gradually, mainly due to rising international oil prices and improved economic activity, demand-side upward pressures were still weak.",
        "Members, meanwhile, emphasized that it would be necessary to be more alert to the widening gap between real and financial conditions and the increasing household debt resulting from steeply rising asset prices.",
        "Some members presented the view that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility that the rising asset prices commonly seen in major countries had come from excessively optimistic expectations about future economic conditions and policy stances.",
        "Members also noted that attention was required as to what effects accommodative monetary policy was having on the distribution of income and assets.",
        "Members also presented the view that it would be necessary to preemptively examine insolvency risks that could be obscured by the various corporate support packages implemented since the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member saw that growth and inflation were generally unlikely to diverge significantly from the paths projected previously, despite the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member expected exports and investment to exceed the previous projections, bolstered by recovery in the semiconductor industry, although recovery in private consumption would be slow.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the projected economic growth rate of around 3% this year would be consistent with the potential growth rate, given the base-period effect, and thus relatively favorable.",
        "The member, however, assessed that uncertainties related to COVID-19 developments were still high, and economic uncertainties had heightened due to the decoupling between the real and asset markets and to the accumulated debt which was unevenly distributed across sectors.",
        "The member noted that the decoupling between the real economy and asset prices was a global phenomenon stemming from the exogenous shock of COVID-19 and from accommodative monetary policy, but the degree of decoupling was higher in Korea, due mainly to a housing policy factor and the skewed recovery of the real economy.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the soaring asset prices which were divorced from the real economy would not only trigger risk on the financial stability side but also work to constrain growth on the macroeconomic side.",
        "The member noted that, in general, growth in debt would drive growth in demand in the short term due to a flow effect, while constraining demand in the long term due to a stock effect from the increased burden of principal and interest payments.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that, if increased private debt followed after soaring asset prices, as seen recently, demand growth in the short term could also be limited.",
        "The member, however, noted that, with the spread of the pandemic continuing, monetary policy should remain accommodative for some time, with a focus on recovery in the real economy.",
        "The member also judged that it would be necessary to pursue improvements in macroprudential policy and measures related to asset markets to slow down the pace of increase in private debt.",
        "The member evaluated the growth divide as having become more serious and employment conditions as having worsened further of late, as recovery in the real economy was led by some export industries, such as IT, and shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic had been concentrated in the low-value-added services industries.",
        "The member saw this as owing to the intensification of structural problems in the domestic economy including a delay in industrial structural reforms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus monetary policy had limited capacity to respond.",
        "Therefore, the member expressed the opinion that more targeted fiscal and credit policy measures should be implemented, and efforts should be made to take this as an opportunity to make structural improvements from the medium- to long-term perspectives.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance by holding the Base Rate at its current level, thus supporting recovery in the real economy.",
        "The member also emphasized that, to pursue financial stability and improvements in the economic structure, efforts should be made to further strengthen coordination with various policies, including macroprudential, fiscal and structural reform policies.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "Looking at changes in conditions at home and abroad since the Monetary Policy Board meeting in November, the member’s evaluation was that recovery momentum in the global economy was weakening due to stronger quarantine measures following the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member, however, noted that economic losses were concentrated mainly in the services industries, and exports and the manufacturing sector were showing relatively strong improvement.",
        "The member also noticed positive changes including the start of vaccinations and approvals of large-scale economic stimulus packages in major countries.",
        "The member thus judged that downside risks to the economic forecast for this year had not grown.",
        "The member saw that the domestic economy continued to recover modestly.",
        "The member noted that, although the nationwide spread of COVID-19 since mid-November had caused consumption to shrink again, investment was favorable and export growth had expanded, bolstered by better-than-expected improvement in the semiconductor industry.",
        "The member, however, raised concern about accumulated economic losses in the face-to-face services industries accounting for a large job creation effect.",
        "For instance, the member pointed out that consumer spending on face-to-face services and sales of small business owners had declined greatly compared to the March figures, and the number of persons employed had declined drastically due to sluggish employment in the relevant industries.",
        "The member also noted that there was a growing possibility that with the prolongation of the pandemic the temporary liquidity shortage stemming from the loss of sales could gradually transform into a solvency issue.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for selective support measures targeting vulnerable sectors, through broad discussions on medium- to long-term industrial policy measures.",
        "Looking at inflation, the member saw that demand-side pressures would be weak for some time, but international oil prices would rise higher than originally expected.",
        "The member thus noted a possibility of consumer price inflation for this year exceeding the previous projection.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to domestic and international financial markets, the member commented that prices of risk assets had increased dramatically, despite the resurgence of the pandemic.",
        "The member cited, as the reason, stronger risk appetite stemming both from higher expectations for economic recovery in line with the start of vaccinations and from the resolution of uncertainties related to the US presidential election and Brexit.",
        "The member noted that this trend would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by further easing financial conditions and supporting consumption through the wealth effect.",
        "The member, however, called for attention to the possibility that, if asset prices rose rapidly in a short period of time, thus leading to wider decoupling with the real economy, this could cause financial instability due to an increased probability of an abrupt asset price correction.",
        "The member added that there was a high likelihood of an accumulation of financial imbalance risk, in that the recent rise in asset prices had been accompanied by significant growth in debt.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% this time and to closely monitor domestic and international financial and economic conditions.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that, in discussions about ending or changing the various financial support measures which had been adopted so far, consideration should be given to the differences in recovery trends by industry, sector, and income class.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, amid a weakening of the global economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 since the November MPB meeting, the domestic economy was maintaining a moderate recovery thanks to expanded growth in exports, although private consumption was sluggish mainly because of stronger social-distancing measures.",
        "The member added that there were positive aspects such as the continued recovery in facilities investment, particularly in the IT sector, and improved leading indicators related to construction investment, which had been undergoing an adjustment.",
        "The member specifically noted that the materialization of recovery in the semiconductor industry this year was expected to have positive impacts on the momentum for improvement in exports and facilities investment.",
        "The member, meanwhile, saw that employment was very sluggish, particularly in the face-to-face services industries, influenced by the spread of COVID-19, and expected the sluggishness to continue for the time being.",
        "The member also projected consumer price inflation to be in the mid-0% range for some time, and then to rise gradually, influenced for instance by increases in international oil prices and improvement in economic activity.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets remained generally stable and financial conditions remained considerably accommodative overall.",
        "The member noted that the paces of increase in household credit, monetary aggregates, and private debt remained high, funds flows to asset markets continued, and asset prices were continuing to increase steeply.",
        "The member judged that the accumulated decoupling between the financial sector and the real economy was leading to increases in potential factors that could undermine financial stability in the future.",
        "The member thus expressed the need for carefully monitoring of these factors.",
        "The member saw that uncertainties surrounding the recovery path were still elevated, and inflationary pressures were expected not to be high for some time.",
        "The member thus stated that monetary policy should maintain an accommodative stance, thus supporting growth and rapid recovery in employment.",
        "The member hence judged it appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that closer attention should be paid to the points that economic agents’ risk appetite had heightened on increased expectations of continued monetary accommodation, and that private debt and asset prices were rising rapidly.",
        "The member stated that it would be necessary to carry out an in-depth analysis of insolvency hidden by the liquidity support.",
        "The member added that it would also be necessary to continue research on adjustments to industrial and employment structures which would be unavoidable due to structural changes in the economy at home and abroad, as well as on the impacts of sustained accommodative monetary policy on wealth and income inequality.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that global economic growth had slowed down since the previous meeting due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries, and forecast that future global economic trends would depend on how quickly vaccinations and other measures would subdue the pandemic.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member noted that the resurgence of COVID-19 and the consequent strengthening of social-distancing measures had contracted private consumption and worsened employment conditions.",
        "On the positive side, however, the member pointed to the continued recovery of exports, the increase in facilities investment particularly in the semiconductor industry, and the growth of construction investment.",
        "The member stated that, although the domestic economy would exhibit a modest recovery as originally forecast, the output gap was expected to remain negative and inflation to fall substantially below its target of 2% for a considerable period of time, and judged that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained until the domestic economy showed clearer improvement.",
        "The member however expressed the view that it would be necessary to bear in mind the following aspects regarding monetary policy operation: First, the member mentioned that there had been arguments at home and abroad that monetary policy should support fiscal policy as the latter’s role had been increasing in the course of the fight against COVID-19, and went on to note that, just as in major countries that were pursuing quantitative easing, there has been growing interest locally in the size, timing and method of government bond purchases by the central bank and also in relevant forward guidance.",
        "The member took the view that government bond purchases might be needed to support real economic recovery and financial market stability, but there should also be comprehensive consideration of issues that might arise in this process.",
        "Next, the member mentioned the need to pay even more attention to financial imbalance problems, such as growing household and corporate debt and a sharp rise in asset prices.",
        "The member emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the sudden concentration in the asset markets of liquidity that had increased as a result of the aggressive monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 shock.",
        "Finally, the member called for continued close monitoring and analysis of the pace of the US economic recovery and the direction of related US Federal Reserve policies.",
        "The member’s further argument was that attention should be paid to the suggestion by some that, if the US economy improved, boosted for example by the Biden administration’s fiscal policy, and inflation pressure increased, the Federal Reserve might change its monetary policy stance sooner than expected.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member assessed that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level and continue to monitor the trends of the real economy and financial markets at home and abroad.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the domestic economy had maintained a modest recovery recently.",
        "By sector, the member noted that, although private consumption had been more sluggish than originally expected, export growth had accelerated, particularly in the IT sector, and facilities investment had continued to recover.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that uncertainties concerning the future growth path in line with pandemic-related developments remained high.",
        "The member mentioned that, although earlier-than-expected vaccinations and future favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry were likely to affect the domestic economy positively, the sustained serious spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of new coronavirus variants had been acting as downside risks.",
        "The member stated that the number of persons employed in December last year had declined at a much faster pace following the third wave of COVID-19, and went on to judge that the worsening of employment conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 had resulted in a substantial degree of slack in the domestic labor market.",
        "The member forecast that consumer price inflation, currently remaining in the mid-0% range, would increase gradually, affected largely by economic improvement, but would remain in the mid- to upper-0% range for the time being.",
        "Concerning the financial markets, meanwhile, the member assessed that accommodative financial conditions had continued amid stronger preference for risk assets.",
        "The member mentioned that stock prices had jumped sharply as investor sentiment had improved significantly on vaccine-related news and expectations of stimulus measures by the Biden administration.",
        "The member added that market interest rates, and long-term rates in particular, had been rising but were still in an accommodative range and that the USD/KRW exchange rate had shown only a limited decline as the recent weakness of the US dollar had stalled.",
        "The member however pointed out that behind these stable market conditions lay latent risk factors that could undermine financial stability.",
        "The member took the view that it would be necessary to examine whether the recent sharp rise in stock prices at home and abroad had been attributable to overly optimistic expectations of future economic trends and policy stances.",
        "The member expressed particular concerns that financial imbalances had been widening continuously, as household debt had been increasing to a great extent on the back of the uptrend in housing and other asset prices.",
        "The member also stated that the rise in long-term interest rates in major countries was seen to have been based on expectations of higher inflation, and some were raising concerns that a continuation of this trend could result in sudden adjustments in asset prices, such as stock prices.",
        "In conclusion, the member argued that it would be necessary to keep the current monetary easing stance for the time being in consideration of high macroeconomic uncertainties related to COVID-19 and worsening employment conditions, and in doing so, changes in financial stability risks should be assessed carefully.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the domestic economy had been on a modest upward path amid the sustained recovery of manufacturing production and facilities investment, but employment and consumption had been in extreme slumps following the third wave of COVID-19.",
        "The member pointed out that people working in face-to-face services industries, less-educated vulnerable groups and young people had continued to suffer damage.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, although face-to-face services industries might recover once vaccinations were well underway, young people as well as less-educated and low-skilled groups would suffer from the long-term aftermath of employment shocks even after the current crisis was over.",
        "The member mentioned that employment sluggishness and the declining income of micro businesses had been contracting consumption capacities and consumer sentiment.",
        "The member added that the current pandemic had in effect been encouraging people with stable employment and income to increase savings and cut consumption.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the consequent overall sluggishness of consumption had kept core inflation within the mid-0% range, and that given the recent household income conditions, employment conditions and demographic factors, major changes were unlikely to be seen in the trends of private consumption and inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the member pointed to the growing concerns about the gap between the real economy and asset prices due to the surge in stock and real estate prices despite the economic recession.",
        "The member took the view that the recent strong stock rally had been driven by expectations of technological innovation in the post-COVID-19 era under the current ultra-low interest rate environment, but questions were raised as to whether such technological innovation would bring about changes comparable to those seen amidst the IT revolutions in the 1990s and the early 2000s.",
        "The member pointed out that what was more concerning was that housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas had risen excessively compared with the income level.",
        "The member stated that, although nominal interset rates had fallen to an unprecendentedly low level, real interest rates had declined comparatively less when low inflation was accounted for, and went on to argue that, given real long-term interest rates, there were doubts as to how long real housing prices could increase.",
        "Furthermore, the member stated that demographic change which would rapidly unfold going foward would limit growth in the number of households, which formed the basis of housing demand, and meanwhile a social consensus had been formed on the need to increase the housing supply, led by the policy authorities, and thus the current housing price growth could not be expected to continue.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member stated that there was no apparent reason for changing the current monetary policy stance preemptively and that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time.",
        "Regarding the recent gap between the real economy and asset prices, the member expressed the view that it would be necessary to closely examine whether overly optimistic expectations had been raising stock prices, and whether excessive anxiety had been lifting housing prices.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economy has weakened due to the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "In global financial markets, despite the coronavirus resurgence, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased steeply and the US dollar has remained weak, due to the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the consequent hopes for economic recovery.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "consumption has contracted due to the recent coronavirus resurgence, facilities investment has continued to recover and export growth has increased, led by the IT sector.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led by exports and investment.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the November forecast.",
        "decline in the prices of public services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) recorded a negative rate, and the inflation expectations of the general public have moved down slightly within the upper-1% range.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time and then moderately increase to around 1% in 2021.",
        "Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen significantly while long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators.",
        "Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country.",
        "and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability such as household debt growth, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook_ (November 2021),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that the domestic economy was sustaining its recovery, boosted by a stronger trend of recovery in consumption and robust exports.",
        "Members mentioned that the domestic economy would maintain favorable growth, but there remained latent uncertainties, such as the possibilities of a resurgence of the pandemic or a prolongation of global supply disruptions.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed that inflationary pressures had expanded, with the number of items showing price increases growing and core inflation exceeding of time.",
        "Some members took the view that attention should be paid to the possibility of a rise in inflation expectations leading to a second round of spillover effects such as wage increases.",
        "Meanwhile, some other members presented the opinion that it would be necessary to analyze how inflation is affected not only by cyclical factors but also by structural factors including deterioration of global supply chains, changes in the economic structure, and the pursuit of carbon neutrality.",
        "Meanwhile, members saw that, amid some financial asset price adjustments due to expectations of domestic and overseas policy rate hikes, growth in household debt and housing prices had slowed somewhat due to regulations on household lending, but it was uncertain whether the current trend would become entrenched for an extended period of time, since financial conditions remained very accommodative.",
        "Some members also stressed the need to analyze the effectiveness of government regulations on household loans, the relationship between deleveraging and financial market price variables, and the effects of monetary policy normalization in major countries on the Korean economy.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Some members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from its current level of 0.75%, while one member argued that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from its current level of 0.75%.",
        "Looking at the changes in domestic and external conditions since the previous MPB meeting, the member assessed that the global economy had been maintaining a relatively sound recovery and inflation had been accelerating.",
        "As to the domestic economy, the member judged that, although the GDP growth rate had slowed in the third quarter, the impacts on the underlying trend of economic recovery had been limited, and went on to state that the forecast of a shift of the output gap to positive in the first half of next year appeared to remain valid.",
        "Most of all, the member forecast that the recovery of consumption would strengthen further, boosted by the relaxing of disease-control measures, and domestic production disruptions caused by supply chain bottlenecks would also ease compared to the third quarter.",
        "The member, however, argued that attention should be paid to uncertainties related to COVID-19 and other potential risk factors including a slowdown in Chinese economic growth and prolongation of global supply chain bottlenecks.",
        "The member also pointed out that consumer price inflation had remained above the Bank’s target since April and the diffusion index had continued to rise, noting that one-off, cyclical and structural factors had all contributed to this trend; accordingly, uncertainties surrounding the price path appeared high.",
        "The member expressed concerns that inflation resulting from global supply bottlenecks could be a transient phenomenon caused by production falling short of demand as the world emerged from the pandemic crisis, but the uptrend in inflation had been also attributable to cyclical factors, such as a strong recovery in demand-side conditions, and to structural factors including changes in consumption behavior, a shrinking labor force and the pursuit of carbon neutrality, and that therefore the possibility of prolonged inflation could not be ruled out.",
        "Furthermore, the member presented the view that, if the inflation increase had been caused by temporary supply shocks, attention should be paid to its impacts on the growth path in the short term, such as a decrease in real purchasing power, and that if inflation is prolonged, a close watch should be kept on its possible negative impacts on economic stability through interactions with inflation expectations, asset prices and wages over the medium- and long-term horizon.",
        "The member judged that accelerating inflation was an underlying trend, considering that the sharp rise in consumer price inflation in October had stemmed not only from one-off factors but also from prices of industrial products excluding petroleum products growing at their fastest pace month on month since the middle of 2017 and from service charges showing relatively rapid growth.",
        "The member also expressed concerns that, given the reflection of housing and leasehold deposit price surges in consumer price inflation with a time lag and exchange rate movements, inflation was highly likely to exceed the target for a considerable period of time.",
        "The member, meanwhile, assessed that, although interest rates had risen and some risk asset prices had declined owing to inflation concerns and changes in monetary policy expectations at home and abroad, financial markets had remained generally stable, while financial vulnerability was estimated to have decreased slightly over the medium-term horizon with household lending and housing prices growing somewhat slowly.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that it was uncertain whether this trend would become entrenched, since financial conditions were very accommodative, potential demand for loans remained strong and profit-seeking tendencies continued.",
        "The member also argued that, since the loan-to-income ratio, the housing price-to-income ratio, and the gaps between these ratios and their long-term trends had increased significantly, monetary policy should continue to focus on the relevant risks.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current 0.75% at this meeting to further adjust the degree of monetary easing, and added that it would be advisable to closely monitor future COVID-19 developments, the effects of a possible prolongation of supply bottlenecks on the price and growth paths, and the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current 0.75%.",
        "Despite the risks caused by concerns about a resurgence of COVID-19 in some countries and by a possible prolongation of global supply bottlenecks, the member expected the global economy to sustain its robust recovery overall, boosted by the economic recoveries in the US and the euro area and by the easing of slumps in emerging economies.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had sustained its favorable recovery led by a rapid rebound in private consumption and strong exports.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member noted that the CPI growth forecast for this year stood at 2.3%, up from the August forecast, and demand-side factors from economic recovery and supply bottlenecks were acting as upside risks.",
        "Looking at the FX and financial sectors, the member took the view that, despite a rise in interest rates due to expectations of monetary policy normalization at home and abroad, the situations in the FX and financial markets were not cause for major concern in terms of conditions for external borrowing, foreign currency liquidity management, and corporate funding.",
        "Regarding the Base Rate decision, the member judged that there existed both upside and downside risks, such as the severity of the pandemic in winter at home and abroad, the timing of a resolution of global supply chain disruptions, and uncertainty surrounding the Chinese economy, but the following two aspects required particular attention.",
        "First, the member noted the ongoing financial imbalance risks.",
        "The member mentioned that household debt growth seemed to have slowed slightly due to regulations on lending to households, but it was uncertain whether the growth would stabilize over a longer-term horizon.",
        "The member also pointed out that there was excessive liquidity in the financial markets, as seen in the real Base Rate falling short of the neutral interest rate and a surge in the money supply relative to its long-term trend.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member argued that, since both the pace and extent of growth in asset prices were too dangerous to be addressed solely by the micromotives of financial institutions and households, it would be necessary to pay close attention to potential risk factors threatening macroeconomic stability from various perspectives.",
        "The member saw that, in the midst of a credit-driven bubble in which both leverage and asset prices rise, the Base Rate would directly and indirectly affect lending and public expectations and contribute to reducing risks to financial stability.",
        "Second, the member took notice of inflation risks.",
        "The member assessed that, in overall consideration of the number of items showing price increases, overseas factors including energy prices, the rise in core inflation, and inflation expectations exceeding Furthermore, the member added that it would be necessary to prepare against risks that could be formed by a combination of the above-mentioned excessive liquidity and supply constraints.",
        "The member saw that, despite concerns about the possibility of a Base Rate hike slowing down economic recovery, the slowdown was unlikely to lead to a reversal of the recovery trend, considering the trend of recovery in domestic and overseas economies from the COVID-19 shock.",
        "The member stressed that the priority as of now should be placed on responding to excessive liquidity and emerging inflation risks.",
        "The member presented the view that, although the domestic economy was expected to sustain robust growth, a close watch should be kept on the evolution of the pandemic, the inflation trends at home and abroad, and monetary policy developments in major countries, and went on to state that, when reducing the amount of liquidity, more policy consideration should be devoted to minimizing the damage to people in real need of loans.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although the global economy continued to improve, the pace of recovery was somewhat slowing except in the US where the recovery was accelerating led by consumption, and added that the Chinese economy in particular was growing at a slower pace.",
        "The member also argued that, despite the overall recovery in global goods demand, supply chain bottlenecks were unlikely to be resolved any time soon.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy continued to recover and private consumption was picking up rapidly boosted by the rising vaccination rate, the easing of social-distancing measures and the implementation of the supplementary budget.",
        "The member however took the view that, despite the rapid recovery, the negative consumption gap remained wide due to the fact that consumption for the fourth quarter of this year would fall short of that during the fourth quarter of 2019.",
        "The member pointed out that consumption in the face-to-face services sector had rebounded significantly following acceleration of vaccination, but unless the recent resurgence of COVID-19 subsided, the strong recovery was unlikely to continue.",
        "In terms of global inflation, the member noted that prices had been maintaining a sharp increase in most countries in line with the continued uptrend in energy prices.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had remained above 2% since April this year, but the price growth had been attributable mostly to energy and food price rises.",
        "The member presented the view that the current high inflation was unlikely to last long, since core inflation had increased by only 1.6% over the 20 months since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the core inflation forecast for next year was 1.8%.",
        "The member added that the rebound in core inflation, which had remained low for the past several years, could be seen as natural reflation following the recovery in domestic demand.",
        "The member noted that, unlike in Korea, inflation had recently exceeded 6% in the US, which had been caused not only by supply chain bottlenecks but also by a massive fiscal injection leading to a rise in household income and consumption.",
        "The member assessed that the number of persons employed in October had risen nearly to the level of February last year, boosted by a rebound in the face-to-face services sector and a recovery in employment.",
        "The member also mentioned that, according to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey by Statistics Korea, the monthly average household income for the third quarter grew by 8.0% year on year and earned income by 6.2%, and income showed even growth across all decile groups, indicating that the economic recovery was leading to household income growth.",
        "The member argued that production growth led by exports and the manufacturing sector had started to lead to a recovery in domestic demand and that there were significant changes in indicators which called for consideration of whether the future path of monetary policy should be adjusted.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that, even if conditions for a Base Rate hike had been partly met, the steep rise in market interest rates over the past several months seemed concerning.",
        "The member stated that the 3-year Treasury yield had risen significantly in a short period of time and banks’ household lending rates had become much higher than during the pre-COVID-19 period, and went on to express concerns that this could work to increase debt-servicing burdens and funding costs, ultimately limiting the real economic recovery.",
        "The member argued that, to ensure a smooth economic recovery, it would be important to encourage both expected and actual market interest rates to take a modest upward path, and emphasized that, in light of this, a strong financial and monetary tightening stance, in which upward Base Rate adjustment was combined with the total quantity control on household loans, did not seem to be an appropriate policy mix.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to examine whether there were any negative transmission channels at work since the August rate hike, that might be witnessed in widening credit spreads and rising delinquency and default rates.",
        "The member added that uncertainty regarding the recovery of domestic demand remained high with the number of confirmed cases soaring again recently, so an additional rate hike did not seem to be urgent in this regard.",
        "Taking all these points into consideration, the member took the view that while it was true that the time had come to discuss adjusting the Base Rate, such decisions should be made carefully in consideration of latent factors increasing uncertainty surrounding the real economy, such as the resurgence of COVID-19 and global supply disruptions.",
        "The member assessed that income growth based on the revitalization of the economy was needed for economic agents to bear the burden of repaying debt that had increased during the pandemic, and went on to argue that in this respect it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.75% for the intermeeting period to induce market rate stability, adding that it would not be too late to determine a Base Rate adjustment once it became clear that a stable recovery of the domestic economy would be sustained.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member projected that the global economy would maintain a trend of recovery next year as well, as the world returns to normal while living with COVID-19, and the recovery gap between advanced and emerging market economies would gradually narrow.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that global inflation would inevitably rise rapidly for a considerable time, due not only to a time lag in supply and demand stemming from a demand recovery and supply bottlenecks, but also to structural factors including structural changes in the labor market, the pursuit of global carbon neutrality, and weakening global supply chains.",
        "The member added that the number of central banks pursuing monetary policy normalization had been increasing in response to the aforementioned economic recovery and rising prices.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, given the solid recoveries in exports and private consumption, the Research Department’s projections of economic growth of 4% this year and 3% next year appeared to be generally appropriate.",
        "The member noted that the consumer price inflation forecast for next year had been revised upward to over level for next year, following similar figures this year.",
        "The member saw upside risks to these forecasts given the increase in the number of items with rising prices and the rise in inflation expectations.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, in the financial market, although the trend of increase in housing sales prices and the trend of growth in household lending had moderated somewhat, this appeared to be attributable to the direct impact of tighter lending regulations on the financial sector.",
        "The member went on to note that household lending could expand again, as expectations for housing price increases and the gap between housing supply and demand were persisting.",
        "Taking all of this into consideration, the member judged that it would be desirable to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation from the perspectives of growth, inflation, and financial stability, and thus expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by an additional 0.25%p at the current meeting.",
        "Regarding additional adjustment to the degree of monetary policy accommodation in the future, the member presented the view that the Board should make the decision while thoroughly assessing growth and inflation conditions, and improvement in financial imbalances.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the output gap was expected to shift into positive territory early next year as GDP growth would exceed its potential level going forward, there still remained downside risks.",
        "The member noted that lessons learned from earlier in the pandemic and a shift in disease control policy measures would support recovery in private consumption, but there still remained risks such as a possibility of disease control measures being tightened in line with the resurgence of the pandemic in winter, and a decline in real purchasing power following price rises.",
        "The member saw that favorable conditions for investment and exports were likely to continue, thanks to domestic and overseas economic recoveries.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that there would be a need to prepare for a possible decline in incentives for corporations to make domestic investment and even a possible weakening of global supply chains, as disruptions affecting production and shipping in key industries were persisting for a long time.",
        "Concerning prices, the member presented the view that policy efforts to prevent inflation expectations from rising appeared to be important, as macroeconomic variables, including the output gap, wages, overseas inflation and exchange rates, were all working to increase prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the member raised the concern that, although investment in risky assets and household lending growth had weakened somewhat of late, there was a long way to go before conditions related to financial imbalances would improve, given Korea’s still-high housing price-to-income and household debt-to-GDP ratios.",
        "The member emphasized that efforts to normalize funding costs and policy cooperation among the relevant authorities should be strengthened.",
        "The member added that these policy efforts were expected to contribute to promoting stable growth in the medium to long term by addressing asset imbalances, which had widened during the pandemic.",
        "To sum up, the member argued that there still was a great need to further reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation going forward from the perspectives of macroeconomic conditions and financial stability.",
        "The member also noted that the Board should decide when to make an additional adjustment to monetary accommodation, while reviewing the transmission effects of the Base Rate hikes, the developments and impacts of the pandemic, and growth and inflation conditions, while carefully monitoring improvements in financial imbalances at the same time.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member judged that the domestic economy was continuing its solid recovery, as exports were sustaining a trend of substantial increase, private consumption was rebounding rapidly due to expanded COVID-19 vaccinations, relaxed disease control measures, and relief payments from the government, and employment conditions were continuing to improve with the number of persons employed soaring particularly in the services industries.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to continue sound growth going forward, bolstered by sustained buoyancy in exports and a stronger recovery in private consumption.",
        "Although there were still uncertainties related to COVID-19, the member anticipated that exports and investment at home would increase, as economic activity would normalize in major economies and trends of economic recovery would be sustained given high vaccination rates, a decline in the fatality rate, and the development of oral COVID-19 medicines.",
        "The member also expected the trend of recovery in consumption to strengthen gradually, influenced by a gradual return to normal daily life.",
        "The member noted that, taking these points into consideration, the Research Department forecast GDP growth for this year and next year to be at the 4% and 3% levels, respectively, unchanged from the August projections.",
        "Concerning prices, the member assessed that consumer price inflation would run well above the path projected in August and remain high at around 3% for several months, and the annual rate of inflation would run in the 2% range next year as well.",
        "The member expected core inflation to rise to the upper-1% level next year from the lower-1% level this year, affected by increased demand-side upward pressures in line with a normalization of economic activity.",
        "The member saw that, if global supply bottlenecks and a higher rise in global commodity prices persisted longer than expected, inflationary pressures could build up further.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that the high rise in housing prices had slowed slightly of late, and home buying sentiment and expectations for a rise in housing prices had declined somewhat.",
        "Looking at financial markets, the member noted that the excessive search for yield which had been more evident this year had weakened somewhat with market interest rates increasing, stock prices falling and household lending growth slowing.",
        "The member judged that this was attributable to rises in lending rates in line with expectations for domestic and overseas policy rate hikes and the government’s regulations on total loan amount.",
        "However, the member assessed that financial conditions were still very accommodative given high growth in monetary aggregates and leverage was still increasing.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be necessary to continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "The member assessed that the downside risks to the economy stemming from an increase in the number of new coronavirus infections were limited, while the upside risks to prices following supply bottlenecks appeared to be very high.",
        "The member commented that the risks posed by the buildup in financial imbalances called for vigilance.",
        "The member noted that, most importantly, if household and corporate leverage continued to increase, policy conditions would worsen, which would inevitably lead to larger policy adjustments.",
        "The member also saw that a rapid shift in monetary policy stances in the US and other major economies caused by higher inflation would be very likely to increase market volatility rapidly, and expressed the opinion that increased leverage was making the domestic economy more vulnerable to these external shocks.",
        "The member thus argued that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to further adjust the degree of accommodation, while thoroughly assessing future developments of growth and inflation, and conditions related to financial imbalances, given ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that support for vulnerable sectors, including the self-employed hit hard by the pandemic, should continue through the use of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility and other selective policy instruments.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member saw that the global economy was continuing its recovery overall, although the momentum of recovery was slowing somewhat, affected by supply disruptions.",
        "The member noted that price inflation had increased in most countries, due to global supply bottlenecks and demand-pulled pressures, and there were growing concerns about the possibility of inflation persisting for a long time.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was maintaining its recovery as originally forecast, thanks to recovery in consumption in line with a gradual shift in the disease control framework.",
        "The member noted that private consumption continued to show a trend of recovery, bolstered by increased consumption related to outdoor activities, despite sluggish sales of passenger cars stemming from disruptions in the supply of semiconductors for vehicles.",
        "However, the member saw that manufacturing production and facilities investment had undergone some degree of adjustment, affected by global supply disruptions, and construction investment was sluggish due to a surge in prices of construction materials and a delay in supply.",
        "The member added that exports continued to grow based on favorable external demand, and employment was approaching the pre-pandemic level thanks to a steady increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation for this year to reach about 2.3%, as consumer price inflation was increasing due to rising international oil prices and commodity prices and a base effect, and core inflation had also risen steeply.",
        "The member saw that consumer price inflation would generally near the inflation target (2%) next year, as factors causing difficulties in global supply would ease and oil and commodity prices would stabilize.",
        "However, the member raised the concern that the number of upside risks to inflation did not appear to be small, given the possibility of corporations’ pass-through of production costs to prices and the trend of inflation expectations.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to bear in mind that there would not be a feedback loop of a steep rise in inflation expectations by the general public leading to wage increases.",
        "The member added that the impacts of gradual changes in the global economic structure on future inflation should be analyzed and observed.",
        "The member noted that, in the global financial markets, the volatility of government bond yields had increased and the US dollar had strengthened, affected by concerns over the prospect of prolonged global inflation and changes in expectations about monetary policy in major countries.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic financial market had been stable overall, household lending had shown slower growth due to continued regulations on total loan amount and rising lending rates, and corporate lending had sustained strong growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that sustained high rates of growth in various liquidity indicators including M2 implied that financial conditions were still very accommodative.",
        "The member saw that uncertainties related to the spread of the pandemic would remain high for some time, but the domestic economy would continue its solid recovery going forward, thanks to gradual improvements in factors causing supply disruptions and further solid growth in pent-up private consumption.",
        "The member judged that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic trends, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from 0.75% at this meeting, as had been mentioned in the October meeting.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, in line with the trend of economic recovery, a gradual normalization of the unprecedented monetary policy accommodation adopted in response to the COVID-19 shock in the first quarter of last year would be helpful to lay a foundation for sustainable economic growth.",
        "The member added that the path of monetary policy normalization as communicated to the market by the Bank of Korea since May this year had already been reflected in market prices, and thus for the moment there was no reason for the Bank of Korea to move differently from those market expectations.",
        "The member noted that since the real Base Rate level had decreased compared to this spring due to higher inflation expectations, the need to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation had increased further.",
        "The member emphasized that under the present circumstances in which adjustments to accommodative monetary policy were expected to continue globally, it would also be necessary to monitor the possibility that the domestic economy could be negatively affected in the medium term by US-China disputes as well as tighter regulations on corporations and slowed real estate market activity in China.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to continue to adjust the accommodative monetary policy stance to steer the Base Rate close to the neutral interest rate, while closely monitoring economic recovery, price developments, and financial market conditions in the future.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Joo, Sangyong expressed clear opposition to raising the Base Rate by Monetary Policy Decision □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.75% to 1.00%.",
        "recover despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.",
        "In global financial markets, the volatility of government bond yields has increased and the US dollar has strengthened, affected by concerns over the prospect of prolonged global inflation and changes in expectations about monetary policy in major countries.",
        "Stock prices, especially in advanced economies, have risen, mainly driven by favorable corporate performances.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "□ The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery.",
        "Although facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints, exports have sustained their buoyancy and private consumption has shown rapid improvement supported by accelerated vaccinations and the easing of domestic COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, the improvement of private consumption is likely to strengthen, while exports and investment are expected to sustain favorable movements.",
        "GDP growth is projected to be around 4% in 2021 and around 3% in 2022, consistent with the forecast in August.",
        "increase in the prices of petroleum products and the base effect from the decline in the prices of public services last year.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-2% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the upper-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run considerably above 2%, exceeding the path projected in August, and then decline gradually, running at around 2% for 2022 as a whole.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to increase to the upper-1% level.",
        "especially the 3-year yield, due to heightened expectations for monetary policy normalization at home and abroad.",
        "Stock prices have risen slightly, affected by stock price movements in major countries, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen.",
        "The amount of increase in household loans has lessened somewhat, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ Members assessed that the domestic economic recovery had been accelerating significantly, with exports and facilities investment showing favorable movements and private consumption improving gradually.",
        "Members projected that upside risks would predominate over downside risks in the growth path going forward, and as a result, the negative output gap would narrow at a faster-than-expected pace.",
        "However, some members expressed the view that, considering the slow pace of improvement in face-to-face services industries, it was a bit too early to conclude that domestic demand had started to show a full-fledged recovery.",
        "In terms of inflation, members mentioned that consumer price inflation had been rising significantly owing primarily to supply-side factors, and expected underlying inflation pressures to build up; for example, core inflation was projected to increase steadily with the economic recovery.",
        "Members, meanwhile, expressed concerns that financial imbalances had been worsening, with private-sector credit increasing and economic agents’ risk preferences strengthening amid the continued accommodative financial conditions.",
        "Some members pointed out that household-sector leverage, in conjunction with prices of assets such as real estate, stocks, and crypto assets, had been expanding even further, and emphasized the need for attention to the possibility that widening financial imbalances could weaken financial market resilience significantly, making the domestic economy vulnerable to internal and external shocks.",
        "One member, however, noted that various indicators suggested that financial imbalances might start to ease gradually, and took the view that significant caution was needed when assessing financial imbalances in connection with monetary policy.",
        "Members also noted that it would be necessary to pay more attention to and conduct in-depth research on structural problems of the Korean economy, such as employment by small business owners, from medium- and long-term perspectives.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member mentioned that, according to the latest _Economic Outlook, the domestic_ economy would grow by 4% this year and 3% next year, led by exports and facilities investment, and the output gap would shift to positive within one year.",
        "The member found it encouraging that private consumption growth was forecast to rebound to 2.5% this year and 3.5% next year.",
        "The member took the view that this was attributable substantially to base-period effects and government support measures, but the trickle-down effects of wide-ranging export strength and the wealth effects of asset price rises were also responsible.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that it was difficult to conclude that domestic demand had started to show a full-fledged recovery, given that it would likely take more than a year for private consumption to return to its pre-COVID-19 level, that household income continued to decrease when the government’s transfer payments were excluded, and that the number of persons employed was growing slowly when government-supported employment was counted out.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member mentioned that attention should be paid to the fact that core inflation with regulated prices excluded was projected at around 2% for the second half of this year and the first half of next year.",
        "The member added that this suggested inflation pressures were increasing due to demand-side factors as well as supply-side ones.",
        "Regarding the financial markets, meanwhile, the member pointed out that asset prices continued to rise and risk preferences continued to strengthen in the accommodative monetary policy environment since the initial phase of the COVID-19 shock.",
        "The member went on to state that, with the increasing leveraged investment in real estate, stocks and crypto assets and the expanding borrowings by financially vulnerable economic agents, vulnerability to an asset price crash and default risk had been building up.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, if the current accommodative financial conditions continue, consumption could be restricted by the buildup of debt and the efficiency of resource allocation could be reduced, ultimately having negative impacts on growth that would overwhelm the short-term stimulus effects.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that, considering the recent real economic and financial conditions and the trends of economic activity and inflation, it was time to consider adjusting the accommodative monetary policy stance slightly.",
        "The member, however, noted that it was necessary to closely monitor economic and financial developments while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the time being, given the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, insufficient recovery in private consumption and employment despite quantitative improvements in macroeconomic indicators, and low likelihood of the current financial imbalances leading to instability of the entire financial system.",
        "The member added that it would be important to think about when to normalize monetary policy and how to communicate appropriately in order to maintain the momentum of economic recovery and at the same time prevent financial imbalances from worsening excessively.",
        "The member also emphasized that economic agents should prepare for increased borrowing costs to avoid becoming more vulnerable to them.",
        "The member, meanwhile, stated that the weak income conditions of vulnerable households, sluggish employment conditions at marginal firms, and restructuring of small business owners were structural problems that were unlikely to be solved even when the pandemic is over and unlikely to be tackled effectively with monetary policy alone, and went on to argue that in this regard it would be necessary to pursue fiscal expenditure in a more targeted way and seek institutional improvement.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member mentioned that the recovery of the Korean economy had been expanding rapidly, with private consumption gradually emerging from its slump recently while exports and facilities investment maintained strong growth, and forecast that the domestic economic recovery was likely to strengthen going forward.",
        "The member stated that the Bank of Korea had raised the growth forecast for this year significantly as the upside risks mentioned in the previous forecast, such as a stronger global economic recovery, improved consumer confidence following vaccinations, and additional government support measures, had materialized substantially, and went on to argue that, although uncertainties related to the outlook for the recovery of the Korean economy had decreased significantly, uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19 and the status of vaccinations remained.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member noted that the growth in service charges had been accelerating, coupled with upward pressures on the supply side.",
        "The member forecast consumer price inflation to remain at the mid-2% level for the time being and then decline somewhat to fluctuate at around 2%, and core inflation to rise gradually to the mid- to upper-1% level affected by increased upward pressures on the demand side in line with the economic recovery.",
        "Looking at the financial markets, the member’s assessment was that preference for high-risk assets had been strengthening based on the accommodative financial conditions and expectations of domestic and overseas economic recoveries.",
        "More specifically, the member noted that the recent acceleration in M2 growth in contrast to the slowdown in M1 growth implied that the additional liquidity that had been supplied was being used by economic agents in strengthening their yield-seeking behavior, for example by investing in performance-based dividend products and marketable instruments.",
        "The member expressed concerns that financial imbalances had been worsening, as the continued risk-taking tendencies and yield-seeking behavior of economic agents had caused household debt to build up and asset prices to rise significantly.",
        "The member noted that various forms of factors causing market instability, such as surges in long-term market interest rates, herd behavior of individual investors, and plunges in crypto asset prices, had been witnessed in the domestic and overseas financial markets since the second half of last year, and went on to state that some were sounding warnings that the prolongation of the current ultra-accommodative financial conditions could lead to investments based on excessive optimism and ultimately to drastic market corrections.",
        "The member pointed out that the widening of financial imbalances would work to weaken financial market resilience significantly and make the Korean economy vulnerable to internal and external shocks, and presented the view that attention should be paid to the fact that the accommodative financial conditions introduced last year to cope with the COVID-19 crisis were now also working to increase financial market unrest.",
        "In conclusion, the member argued that, given the forecast of a stronger domestic economic recovery and growing risks to financial stability, there was a need to consider partially adjusting the current stance of monetary policy that had been eased to an unprecedented extent in response to the COVID-19 crisis, but considering underlying uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19, it would be necessary to communicate closely with economic agents about recognition of the changes in economic and financial conditions and the direction of policy in consideration of such changes, while maintaining the current monetary easing stance for the time being.",
        "The member in this regard judged that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "Looking at the changes in domestic and external conditions since the previous MPB meeting, the member assessed the recovery of the global economy as strengthening gradually, boosted by expansion of vaccine distribution and reopening the economy as well as the economic stimulus in major countries.",
        "The member, however, mentioned that caution was needed in forecasting the medium- and long-term growth path of the global economy, since the gap in economic activity between countries remained wide and the evolution of the current health crisis, including the spread of variants, remained uncertain.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, boosted by the faster-than-expected recovery of the domestic economy, real GDP had returned to its pre-COVID-19 level in the first quarter and the gap in economic activity between industries and sectors had been narrowing gradually.",
        "The member, however, judged that uncertainty surrounding the recovery path had not yet been eased substantially.",
        "More specifically, the member pointed out that demand in face-to-face industries remained sluggish compared with the pre-COVID-19 period and, considering the pace of the recent COVID-19 spread and the trend of vaccinations in Korea, it would be difficult to expect such demand to return to normal soon.",
        "The member stressed that attention should be paid to the possibility of the overall consumption recovery path being constrained by the sluggishness of employment of vulnerable groups, if improvement in face-to-face industries is delayed for a long time.",
        "The member presented the view that in this regard it would be advisable to maintain the current degree of monetary easing for the time being to help private consumption and the employment situation show more robust improvement.",
        "The member noted that attention should be paid to the significant acceleration in consumer price inflation and the sustained strong growth in private-sector credit that had occurred in the meantime.",
        "First, in terms of consumer price inflation, the member forecast that, considering that the recent increase in consumer price inflation had been attributable mainly to supply-side inflation pressures and one-off factors, this trend would not continue past the second half of this year.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that the possibility should not be ruled out of the upward pressures on underlying inflation growing to a larger extent than expected, since inflation caused by supply-side factors had lasted for longer than usual and inflation expectations were likely to increase further as economic activity normalized.",
        "Next, the member emphasized the need to keep an eye on the negative effects of strong growth in private-sector credit amid the accommodative financial conditions.",
        "The member pointed out that an appropriate degree of credit expansion works to enhance economic recovery by acting in a virtuous circle with the real economy, but excessive interactions between credit expansion and asset price rises can lead to the risk of an accumulation of financial imbalances, undermining the sustainability of future financial stability and economic growth.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, despite various macroprudential policy measures in place to cope with the risk, households’ yield-seeking behavior using leverage had been strengthening amid the sustained expectations of a continued accommodative monetary policy stance, while the recent economic recoveries at home and abroad and inflation expectations could act to further increase leverage, and thus there was a growing need to consider related risks when making monetary policy decisions.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that at this point it was necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level, while keeping a close watch on whether the real economy expands further, the trend of the price path, and the possibility of a worsening of financial imbalances, and gradually adjust the degree of monetary easing at the appropriate time.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was sustaining a trend of export-driven recovery since the second half of last year.",
        "The member noted that the relatively small contraction in global goods consumption despite the pandemic, and aggressive stimulus measures by major countries, had been positive factors for the recovery of the domestic economy, which is heavily dependent upon manufacturing industries.",
        "The member saw that domestic goods exports were likely to maintain strong growth in the future as well.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although private consumption was emerging from its sluggishness, the pace of recovery was slow due to the modest pace of vaccination and remaining uncertainties about the resurgence of the pandemic.",
        "The member raised concern that, with continued sluggishness in self-employed businesses that are largely dependent upon face-to-face services, the trend of decline in owners of self-employed businesses with employees, in particular, did not halt, despite improvements in employment conditions in both manufacturing and services industries, and high rates of growth in working hours.",
        "Meanwhile, the member pointed out that indicators were unclear as to whether household income was recovering, which implied that it would likely to take a substantial time for economic recovery to lead to improved household income, even if the economy recovers rapidly, led by exports and facilities investment.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that the rising prices accompanying economic recovery were mainly due to base effects, but were also a sign that consumption had begun to emerge from its extreme sluggishness.",
        "The member expected consumer price movements to be affected by base effects and supply-side factors, but to be partially influenced by the pace of recovery in employment and household income as well.",
        "However, the member added that price inflation would fall short of the inflation target for the year as a whole, and inflation would slow next year due to the disappearance of base effects.",
        "The member presented the opinion that it should be remembered that inflation had remained below the target for nine years since 2012 and had run in the 0% range for two years in a row, despite upward pressures on prices stemming from the economic recovery.",
        "The member noted that, unlike exports and manufacturing industries, consumption and services industries were still at the initial stage of recovery.",
        "The member thus added that a change in the current monetary policy stance could constrain domestic demand and the pace at which price movements normalize.",
        "The member noted that it was true that household lending had soared, the gap between the real economy and housing prices had widened, and financial imbalances had built up over the past year.",
        "The member particularly saw that housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas had risen excessively compared with the income level.",
        "The member went on to assess that this was attributable to concerns about a shortage of housing and to expectations that low interest rates would persist for a long time.",
        "However, the member noted that, despite the unprecedentedly low Base Rate, mortgage lending rates had already risen above the pre-pandemic level, and the housing transaction volume and new lending related to housing sales had been gradually declining of late.",
        "The member thus stressed that potential home buyers that depend heavily on loans should pay attention to the facts that the gap between the real economy and housing prices would not persist for a long time, and the current accommodative monetary policy stance would not last forever.",
        "The member added that it would be desirable for the overshooting in housing prices to be resolved gradually through the adjustment of home buying sentiment.",
        "Taking these points into overall consideration, the member saw that, although the domestic economy was sustaining a trend of recovery, led by exports and investment, and had emerged from downward inflationary pressures, it would take considerable time for the domestic economy to return to growth at its pre-pandemic potential level.",
        "The member also projected that it would take substantial time for GDP growth to lead to expansion in household income, wages, employment and consumption.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level, as inflation was still well below the target and there was no clear reason to preemptively hold back the momentum of economic expansion.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level.",
        "The member assessed that, since the April MPB meeting, the global economy was showing a trend of expanded recovery, and this was contributing to buoyancy in the domestic economy, driven by exports and facilities investment.",
        "The member noted that exports and investment in the non-IT sector, as well as the IT sector including the semiconductor industry, had been showing growth.",
        "The member’s assessment was that private consumption was gradually improving thanks to the government’s support measures and the easing of social distancing rules, and it was encouraging that the trend in face-to-face services industries was showing a reversal from the significant contraction seen so far.",
        "The member commented that the easing of sluggish demand in face-to-face services was leading to improvements in employment conditions, and expected employment in services industries to show modest growth overall.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation was showing a high uptrend in the second quarter, and saw that core inflation would gradually rise, backed by a trend of economic growth.",
        "The member mentioned that, according to the latest _Economic Outlook, the growth_ rate for this year was being revised upward to 4.0%, and expressed the opinion that, although this figure exceeded the financial market’s expectations, it did not appear to be excessively optimistic, given the recent trend of faster global economic recovery.",
        "The member added that upside risks to the outlook could materialize if the government came up with additional aggressive economic recovery policy measures.",
        "The member judged that, despite such favorable real economic conditions of late, the current accommodative monetary policy stance should be kept unchanged due to remaining uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and vaccine rollouts.",
        "The member thus argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% and continue to observe future real economic developments and financial market conditions.",
        "The member noted that it was necessary to focus on a few points before making monetary policy decisions going forward.",
        "Most importantly, the member presented the view that there was a need to continuously examine the possibility that the current negative GDP gap would disappear sooner than expected.",
        "The member commented that the materialization of upside risks to the outlook would bring forward the timing of the disappearance of the negative GDP gap to the fourth quarter of this year.",
        "However, the member saw that pandemic-related developments still remained uncertain and that it would take more time before employment and economic conditions felt by ordinary people and self-employed businesses would recover, and thus consideration should be given to this point as well.",
        "Next, the member noted the importance of monitoring US monetary policy and the trends of market interest rates, as higher and persistent global inflation would affect not only the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, but also policy decisions of the Bank of Korea.",
        "Finally, the member stressed that attention should be paid to the possible worsening of financial imbalances, as leverage was increasing further due to the interaction of ongoing growth in household debt with asset prices, such as real estate, stock and virtual asset prices.",
        "The member commented that market volatility could heighten in line with future trends of global inflation and the consequent changes in the monetary policy directions of major countries.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be necessary to closely analyze and bring attention to this point to ensure that each economic agent could prepare against such a risk.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "The member saw that the world economy was generally maintaining its recovery, and expected global GDP to return to the pre-crisis level in the second quarter of this year.",
        "The member also noted that global trade had been sustaining a trend of recovery since the second half of last year.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the recovery was spreading more noticeably, and the positive sentiment of economic agents and the outlook for economic recovery had strengthened further since the April MPB meeting.",
        "The member pointed out that concerns about COVID-19 infection had lessened following the higher vaccination rate among senior citizens, and economic activity had been gradually increasing with the Google Mobility Index rising above the pre-pandemic level, although the coronavirus pandemic was still ongoing.",
        "The member noted that, in terms of sectors, manufacturing production remained solid, bolstered by expanded exports, and services production was also gradually emerging from its sluggishness, particularly in face-to-face services production.",
        "The member added that retail sales and construction investment were improving, facilities investment was sustaining a strong recovery, and export growth was increasing.",
        "The member saw that, in reflection of these movements, growth for this year would likely reach about 4%, much higher than the April forecast, and the negative GDP gap would likely shrink more rapidly than expected.",
        "The member presented the view that, looking at risk factors surrounding the latest forecasts, the upside risks were more likely to materialize than the downside risks.",
        "Meanwhile, the member saw that consumer price inflation was likely to run above the 2% range for some time, largely affected by temporary factors such as sustained upward trends in agricultural, livestock, and fisheries product prices, rising international commodity prices, and global supply difficulties.",
        "However, the member noted that it would be necessary to pay close attention to price trends, as the global supply difficulties could persist or underlying factors, such as expanded domestic demand or wage growth, could come into play.",
        "The member judged that the financial market remained accommodative, with household lending growing rapidly and corporate credit expanding greatly, even as various macroprudential surveillance regulations were put in place or even reinforced.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the unusually accommodative monetary policy, which had been ongoing for over one year after being adopted in the face of an unprecedented crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, had contributed to the return to economic recovery, by preventing excessive economic contraction and the undermining of future growth potential, and by ensuring stability in the financial market.",
        "However, the member pointed out that, in this process, leverage had increased substantially, as private sector credit grew very rapidly, and the risk appetite of economic agents strengthened.",
        "The member raised concerns that, if these conditions persisted for a long time, the buildup in financial imbalances would deepen, rapid debt growth would act to constrain consumption and investment in the medium to long term, and an external shock could cause financial instability.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that gradual normalization of the interest rate level would be needed to curb the deepening of financial imbalances and reduce any possibility of future financial instability.",
        "The member saw that adjusting the degree of monetary policy accommodation could somewhat negatively affect the trend of economic recovery, but the negative impacts could be buffered considerably, given the strong recoveries in major countries and the stability in the international financial market.",
        "Meanwhile, the member pointed out that the prolongation of the current unprecedentedly accommodative monetary policy stance could further increase costs in the future course of interest rate normalization.",
        "The member also noted that there would be a need to ensure space for monetary policy to some extent to prepare for a possibility of underlying low economic growth and the future economic cycle.",
        "The member thus presented the view that normalization of the current unprecedented monetary accommodation should not be put off for too long.",
        "The member saw that there still were considerable uncertainties related to the solidity of future recovery, although economic recoveries at home and abroad were expanding gradually.",
        "The member also judged that the Board should fully communicate with the market in advance, even if the degree of monetary policy accommodation were to be adjusted.",
        "The member took the opinion that, from this perspective, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time, to monitor the progress of the economic recovery for the coming months, and to begin to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation in a timely manner, in overall consideration of employment and price trends, and financial market conditions.",
        "The member added that this would be helpful to lay a foundation for stable and sustainable economic growth in the medium to long term.",
        "The member noted that the Board should not delay adjusting the degree of accommodation for too long, and stressed that the Board should take the ensuing steps in a gradual manner, while cautiously monitoring market reactions and economic conditions.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major countries, accelerated vaccinations, and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity.",
        "In global financial markets, the rise in stock prices in major countries has moderated as risk-taking tendencies were offset by factors such as inflation concerns.",
        "Government bond yields have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover robustly, while private consumption has gradually emerged from its slump.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "Going forward, the recovery of the Korean economy is likely to strengthen thanks to the buoyancy of exports and investment as well as the improvement in private consumption.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, significantly above the February forecast of 3.0%.",
        "rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices.",
        "Core inflation considerably to the lower-1% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have risen slightly within the lower-2% range.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the upper-1% range this year, considerably exceeding the February forecast of 1.3%.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to run at the lower-1% range.",
        "affected mainly by strengthened economic recoveries at home and abroad.",
        "Stock prices continued to increase before declining moderately due to global financial market movements.",
        "The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated slightly.",
        "Household loan growth has remained high, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "While the Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen and inflation to remain at a high level for some time, there are underlying uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to be modest.",
        "Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process the Board will assess developments related to COVID-19 and economic developments in major countries, while paying closer attention to the buildup of financial imbalances such as fund flows concentrated in asset markets and household debt growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that the domestic economy was showing recovery, led by exports and facilities investment.",
        "Members saw that the spread of virus variants and the consequently strengthened social distancing measures would work to contract private consumption.",
        "Members, however, expected the negative impacts on consumption to be limited, thanks to increasing vaccine distribution, the government’s economic stimulus package, and economic agents’ lessened sensitivity to the disease.",
        "Meanwhile, some members presented the opinion that attention should be paid to the possibility of a bottleneck in the supply chain causing a delay in manufacturing production.",
        "Members saw that, with respect to prices, consumer price inflation for this year would run above the path projected in May, due not only to upward inflationary pressures on the supply side but to gradually increased pressures on the demand side as well.",
        "Members also assessed underlying price movements, including core inflation, to be generally on the rise.",
        "Members saw that financial conditions remained accommodative, and raised concerns that risks on the financial side had built up due to increased search for yield by economic agents and greater expectations for additional price rises in asset markets amid high growth in private-sector leverage.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to housing prices which remained on the sharp rise, some members assessed that there were large upside risks in the short term, presenting the opinion that it would be important to take effective housing supply measures to ensure price stability.",
        "Other members pointed out that housing prices were continuing to increase despite the fact that households’ mortgage interest rates had recently risen above the pre-pandemic level.",
        "They called for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between housing prices and various financial and economic variables, including interest rates.",
        "In addition, members stressed the need to pay close attention to the economic shocks from COVID-19 on vulnerable groups, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, and the future developments of US long-term bond yields.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%, while one member argued for raising it by One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was sustaining a trend of export-driven recovery in the second quarter, as in the first quarter.",
        "The member saw that, although domestic demand such as private consumption had emerged from its sluggishness, the trend of recovery would likely slow due to greatly strengthened social distancing levels stemming from the recent resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "With respect to employment conditions, the member pointed out that, although the number of persons employed had been on the steady rise, the recovery in employment showed an uneven pattern depending on industry and occupational status, and the share of the long-term unemployed had risen.",
        "The member also assessed that, although inflation had recently been subject to upward pressures, it was highly likely to run below the target level at the end of this year as the base effect fades.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, particularly since consumer price inflation had run in the 0% range for two years in a row and the trend of recovery in consumption was expected to be delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19, present conditions did not give rise to concerns about upward inflationary pressures over a medium-term horizon.",
        "The member stated that the government had been conducting an expansionary fiscal policy to cope with domestic and international shocks since 2019.",
        "The member noted that government spending growth ran far above spending growth in non-government sectors in 2019, and this tendency strengthened further in 2020 due to responses to COVID-19.",
        "As a result, the member estimated that, although real GDP in 2020 declined by only 0.9% year on year, spending in non-government sectors fell by about 2.5%.",
        "The member saw that, although vaccination was gathering pace, the aftereffects of the pandemic were lasting longer than initially expected.",
        "The member also expected that it would likely to take substantial time for the export-driven economic recovery to lead to stable expansion of household income, wages, employment and consumption.",
        "The member thus stated the opinion that it was still important for fiscal policy to take an active role, and there was a need for a policy mix with accommodative monetary policy keeping step with fiscal policy until the crisis could be overcome.",
        "The member saw that there were growing expectations for a Base Rate hike since the May MPB meeting, noting that a Base Rate hike is one of various tools to rein in housing price increases and household debt growth.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that, since housing price increases of late had not been led by investment by owners of multiple houses actively searching for high returns, it would be very difficult to estimate the effects of an interest rate increase on the housing market.",
        "The member added that households’ mortgage interest rates were already running above the pre-pandemic level in reflection of the government’s lending regulation measures, and policy measures to offset the negative side effects of low interest rates, such as debt service ratio (DSR) rules differentiated by borrower, had also taken effect.",
        "The member expressed the view that household debt should be stabilized through macroprudential policy, not monetary policy, stressing the importance of patiently abiding by this principle.",
        "The member assessed that, although the coronavirus shock had been triggered by the spread of an infectious disease, from an economic perspective it was closer to a polarization shock.",
        "The member presented the opinion that since the negative impacts were concentrated in vulnerable sectors, groups and borrowers, the trend of their income recovery should be closely observed.",
        "The member judged that it would not be late to discuss a Base Rate hike after a sufficient degree of vaccination had been achieved.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed the recovery in the world economy to have strengthened overall.",
        "The member saw that, although COVID-19 variants were spreading, there had been a significant decrease in the number of severe cases or deaths, and thus the spread of the virus would likely have limited economic impacts compared to the past.",
        "However, the member pointed out the possibility of economic recovery slowing somewhat in some EMEs with low vaccination rates.",
        "The member saw that, with respect to global trade, goods trade was sustaining high growth, while recovery in service trade had been delayed.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member expected exports and facilities investment to remain robust, thanks to rapid economic recoveries of our major trading partners, and a trend of recovery in the global IT industry.",
        "The member saw that private consumption would contract for some time due to tighter social distancing measures, but the decline in consumption would be smaller than those during past resurgences of the coronavirus, given the plans for large-scale vaccination, the accumulation of household savings, and the lessened sensitivity of the public to the disease.",
        "The member anticipated that the domestic economy would maintain a broader recovery in the second half of this year as well, since the constraints on consumption would be offset by expanded consumption stemming from the government’s economic stimulus package.",
        "The member assessed that consumer price inflation for this year was highly likely to reach the 2% range, somewhat higher than the May forecast, due to a faster rise in international oil prices of late.",
        "In light of the trends of increase in various indexes representing underlying inflation, inflationary pressures were heightening broadly and were not limited to specific items.",
        "The member judged the financial market to remain significantly accommodative.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the accumulation of financial imbalances was continuing, as leveraged financing by households and corporations was showing high growth, and investment funds were flowing into asset markets due to ample market liquidity and stronger risk-taking appetite.",
        "The member stated that the domestic economy would maintain a trend of recovery overall.",
        "The member, however, judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level, given that it would be necessary to wait and observe further the impacts of the current resurgence of the coronavirus on the future growth path, and that economic agents should have more time to communicate the future monetary policy direction with the Bank of Korea, particularly since only about a month had passed since the Bank began to communicate with them a possible adjustment of the degree of monetary policy accommodation within this year.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that if future movements of growth and prices did not deviate far from the current predictions, an adjustment to the degree of monetary policy accommodation within the coming months should be considered, as had been discussed in the May MPB meeting.",
        "The member added that this would be necessary for the domestic economy to lay a foundation for stable and sustainable growth in the medium to long term.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that growth in the global economy was gathering pace since the last MPB meeting.",
        "The member expected trends of economic recovery in major countries to continue in the second half as well, although uncertainties related to the coronavirus conditions were increasing due to the emergence of virus variants.",
        "The member saw that export-driven recovery had been gradually materializing since the beginning of this year and facilities investment remained solid overall.",
        "The member also expected construction investment to show improvement in the second half of this year.",
        "The member saw that private consumption was unlikely to run well below the level projected in May thanks to the government’s economic stimulus package, despite the rapid spread of COVID-19.",
        "With respect to prices, the member assessed that, as consumer price inflation had run above 2% every month since the beginning of the second quarter, prices were somewhat emerging from the low levels they had been recording, with personal service charges, as well as prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and petroleum-based products, showing upward trends.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that there was no urgent need to adjust the Base Rate level, judging from current real economic conditions.",
        "The member pointed out that, more importantly, concerns about COVID-19 were increasing due to the emergence of virus variants.",
        "The member also assessed that there would still be room for closely watching price developments, since consumer prices were likely to fall to the inflation would likely recover to the mid-1% next year from the lower-1% level this year.",
        "However, given financial stability conditions, the member expressed the view that the time had come to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "The member particularly raised the concern that household debt was continuing to grow despite the government’s lending regulation measures, and funds were continuing to flow into asset markets such as the real estate.",
        "The member assessed that the accommodative monetary policy in place since the COVID-19 outbreak had played an important role in preventing a sharp contraction in the real economy, but had simultaneously caused a rise in asset prices.",
        "The member added that these rising financial imbalances were commonly faced by most central banks in advanced economies.",
        "The member stated that there were various opinions as to how the central bank could preemptively respond to an asset market bubble, and it was undeniable that the fundamental mandate of monetary policy, a part of macroeconomic policy, was to give first consideration to the real economy.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that more attention should be given to financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy at the present moment.",
        "The member noted that it had been often pointed out that an adjustment to the degree of monetary policy accommodation under the current ongoing COVID-19 crisis conditions could increase difficulties faced by vulnerable groups.",
        "The member, however, raised the concern that persistent debt growth as seen recently would lead to greater risk of a so-called debt trap, which would make it impossible to normalize interest rates due to the excessive debt burden.",
        "The member pointed out that, recalling historical experience, excessive credit had caused bubbles to form and burst, weakening the financial sector’s soundness and intermediary role and ultimately worsening the real economy to a great extent.",
        "The member thus stressed that it would be extremely important to ensure financial stability for stable domestic economic growth at this point.",
        "The member noted that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be desirable to give greater weight to financial stability and raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%.",
        "The member added that monetary policy was expected to have a signaling effect on asset markets, although some pointed out that it would be difficult to deal with excessive expectations for price increases in asset markets through a slight interest rate hike.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it was inevitable that the increased burdens on vulnerable groups, including the working-class, the self-employed, and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), following an interest rate hike would have to be dealt with through fiscal policy which can target specific sectors.",
        "The member also stressed the need to consistently push for macroprudential policies aimed at reigning in the pace and size of debt growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expressed the need for a thorough analysis of US inflation, which had shown higher-than-expected growth.",
        "The member assessed that inflation in the US and the consequent changes in its monetary policy would highly likely to lead the world economy to areas of uncertainty.",
        "The member thus raised the concern that reversals of elements that had all moved in only one direction during the pandemic, such as expansionary fiscal policy based on government bond issuance at low rates, rising asset market prices based on leveraged investment, and expansions in household and corporate debt, could trigger unforseen shocks.",
        "The member also noted that previous cases had shown that shifts in the US monetary policy stance were accompanied by economic unrest in EMEs, and thus pointed out that attention was needed in this regard.",
        "In addition, the member expressed the view that careful thought should be given to orderly normalization of the emergency measures taken to deal with the pandemic crisis.",
        "The member stated that numerous emergency measures had expired so far, but supporting the credit market through an SPV that purchases corporate bonds and commercial paper, and the expansion of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, were still ongoing.",
        "The member added that, if there was a Base Rate hike in consideration of financial imbalances, it would be desirable to maintain these measures aimed at supporting vulnerable groups for some time.",
        "Finally, the member noted that monetary policy alone could not guarantee medium to long-term economic growth, since it is fundamentally a macroeconomic policy that responds to short-term economic fluctuations.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that monetary policy that accounted for financial stability would be able to establish a foundation for stable economic growth in the longer term.",
        "The member thus stressed that a foundation for economic stability should be established based on monetary policy, while structural issues to ensure long-term growth of the domestic economy should be dealt with through the government’s aggressive economic policy.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was sustaining a favorable recovery, with exports and facilities investment maintaining strong growth and the recovery of private consumption strengthening gradually.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to exhibit growth consistent with the path forecast last May, although uncertainties related to COVID-19 had increased again.",
        "The member’s forecast was that stronger recoveries of the US and other major economies would have positive impacts on exports of and investment in Korea’s key industries.",
        "The member also projected that consumption would sustain its underlying trend of improvement, since the effects of the spread of the virus variants were unlikely to last long considering the full-scale vaccinations of young and senior age groups and previous measures to combat COVID-19, and the government was implementing policy measures to support income and boost consumption.",
        "Looking at inflation, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had risen to the mid-2% level, boosted by the accelerating growth in service charges in addition to supply-side upward pressures, and core inflation had also sustained its modest growth of the lower-1% level.",
        "The member expected inflation to be somewhat above the May forecast growth path going forward.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that housing price growth had accelerated, particularly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and home purchase sentiment and expectations of higher housing prices were also rising again.",
        "Concerning the financial markets, the member pointed out that market risks were increasing, with continued risk preference and heightened volatility of capital flows between financial institutions.",
        "The member noted that there were growing concerns in the stock market about overly optimistic expectations from individual investors and leveraged speculative transactions.",
        "The member also assessed that institutional investors had been increasing short-term transactions involving MMFs and RPs and expanding investment in high-risk assets such as non-prime corporate bonds, and in this process the interconnectedness of financial markets had increased, leading to higher interest rate and credit risks throughout the markets.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that household debt had exhibited another sharp rise in June and the rate of growth in M2 and other liquidity indicators remained high.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the increasing imbalances throughout the financial markets could work to weaken financial system resilience and make the domestic economy vulnerable to internal and external shocks.",
        "The member argued that financial conditions, which had been eased to an extraordinary extent to cope with the COVID-19 crisis last year, were now acting as a factor worsening financial imbalances, and it would be therefore necessary to adjust the degree of easing appropriately.",
        "In conclusion, the member assessed that, considering the forecast of a strong, sustained recovery of the domestic economy and the continued increase in financial stability risks, it would be necessary to partly adjust the degree of monetary easing in the near future.",
        "However, the member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%, considering the need to observe the developments and effects of the recent resurgence of COVID-19 for a little longer.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level.",
        "The member assessed that, since the previous MPB meeting, the global economic recovery had been strengthening, boosted by accelerated vaccination and eased restrictions on economic activity.",
        "However, the member pointed out that the possibility could not be ruled out of a subdued economic recovery particularly in emerging market countries with low vaccination rates, since developments of the health crisis remained volatile with the rapid global spread of virus variants.",
        "The member mentioned that the domestic economy had continued to show similar developments to those of the global economy, and projected that a mix of upside and downside risks, such as supply chain bottlenecks, the resurgence of COVID-19, accelerated vaccinations and stimulus measures, would work to increase the volatility of economic activity greatly for the time being.",
        "The member expected the manufacturing sector to reverse to an uptrend at any moment, considering the positive forecast for the business climate by corporations and the steady improvement in inventories and in conditions for final demand, such as exports.",
        "Concerning the services sector, meanwhile, the member judged that economic losses in face-to-face industries would be inevitable, as the trend of their recoveries had been disrupted greatly in the short term by stricter social distancing rules.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, since vaccines had proved to be somewhat effective in preventing people from getting infected with COVID-19 and, in case of infections, from getting seriously ill, and since face-to-face economic activities were being replaced with non-face-to-face economic activities based on the lessons learned from previous experiences, the resurgence of COVID-19 was likely to have only limited effects on GDP over a medium-term horizon.",
        "The member, however, noted that a careful approach was needed in estimating the economic impacts of the resurgence, since vaccination was proceeding more slowly in Korea than in major countries and the spread of virus variants had started to pick up at a time when face-to-face activities were increasing.",
        "The member assessed that consumer price inflation had exceeded 2% for the third consecutive month, and that supply-side inflationary pressures had declined somewhat but remained higher than originally forecast while demand-side inflationary pressures had also been increasing gradually.",
        "The member also mentioned that inflation expectations among the general public had been growing rapidly since the beginning of this year, and added that attention had been paid to whether this uptrend would continue and also to the correlation between inflation expectations and asset inflation.",
        "The member meanwhile assessed the financial markets as remaining relatively stable.",
        "The member also expressed concerns about the growing risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances due to the continued search for yield by economic agents and strengthening interactions between increasing private-sector leverage and rising asset prices under accommodative financial conditions.",
        "More specifically, the member noted that household credit had maintained strong growth and housing price growth had been accelerating again, raising concerns about their negative impacts.",
        "The member pointed out that upward trend in Korea’s household debt-to-income ratio had been gaining pace since the outbreak of COVID-19 to substantially surpass the average of major advanced countries, Korea’s housing price-to-income ratio (PIR) had also been growing more rapidly than that of other countries, and the ratio’s disparity from its long-term equilibrium level had widened significantly.",
        "The member presented the view that, if these risks are not appropriately managed, they could undermine future economic growth and financial stability through a potential increase in debt repayment burdens and the possibility of drastic price adjustments, and that in this regard there was a growing need to make monetary policy responses along with implementing various macroprudential measures.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that, while the domestic economy had maintained the underlying trend of recovery, consumer price inflation was likely to exceed the May forecast and the risk of financial imbalances, such as increasing private-sector leverage and an over-concentration of funds in asset markets, had been worsening gradually.",
        "The member took the view that it would be necessary in this regard to adjust the degree of monetary easing and change the policy stance to meet changing financial and economic conditions.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that, since the resurgence of COVID-19 could limit the short-term trend of economic activity and add to uncertainty, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level and observe a little longer developments of the health crisis and the economic situation at home and abroad.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member expected Korea’s growth rate for this year to be at around 4% as originally forecast, since briefings by the Research Department indicated that the spread of variants was likely to have only limited negative effects on consumption compared with the past due mainly to accelerated vaccinations and loosened vigilance against the pandemic while the supplementary budget was expected to have positive effects.",
        "With respect to exports and investment, the member considered it fortunate to see exports and investment buoyant despite the global spread of virus variants, boosted largely by recoveries of major economies and digital innovation.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that attention should be paid to possible production setbacks in key manufacturing industries, due mainly to the continued supply chain bottlenecks resulting from a shortage of semiconductor supply, limited logistics facilities, and the spread of COVID-19 in certain regions of the country.",
        "The member forecast consumer price inflation to be nearly 2% this year and core inflation to remain in the lower-1% range with both supply- and demand-side upward pressures strengthening.",
        "The member expressed the view that core inflation felt by the general public might be much higher than the actual figures, given that regulated items account for a large share of Korea’s statistics on consumer price inflation and owners’ equivalent rent (OWR) is excluded from the statistics, and added that this was not irrelevant to the recent rise in inflation expectations.",
        "Concerning the financial sector, the member pointed to the accumulation of risks owing to the unprecedented expansion in leverage and the strengthening risk preference.",
        "The member noted that a look at the rates of growth in housing sales prices in the world’s major cities and stock price growth rates in major countries since the beginning of last year showed that Korea ranked near the top.",
        "The member added that Korea’s household debt-to-GDP ratio had become much higher than those of major countries, with financial institution household lending recording its largest-ever increase and the outstanding amount of loans on margin accounts hitting a record high in the first half of this year.",
        "Considering these macroeconomic and financial stability conditions, the member expressed the view that it would be necessary not to wait too long to start adjusting the monetary easing stance.",
        "The member however added that, considering the heightened uncertainty surrounding the growth path due to the recent rapid resurgence of COVID-19, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level and closely monitor future economic developments to determine when to start monetary policy normalization.",
        "The member also stressed the need to examine whether the prolongation of the accommodative policy stance in response to the COVID-19 shock was working to increase the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "Furthermore, the member added that it would be necessary to consider more direct financial and fiscal support for vulnerable groups hit hardest by the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Koh, Seung Beom expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level and argued for raising it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economy has strengthened, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.",
        "In global financial markets, stock prices have continued to rise, reflecting the economic recovery.",
        "The US dollar has strengthened, while long-term government bond yields have declined considerably due mainly to the spread of COVID-19 variants.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "investment have sustained their buoyancy and private consumption has shown improvement.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high.",
        "Going forward, exports and investment will sustain their buoyancy, while private consumption is forecast to temporarily weaken affected by the coronavirus resurgence but then return to the path of recovery supported by the execution of a supplementary budget.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in May.",
        "rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices.",
        "Core inflation lower-1% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have risen slightly to the lower-to mid-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to run in the lower- to mid-2% range for some time, exceeding the path projected in May.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to increase gradually to the mid-1% range.",
        "exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "The 3-year Korean Treasury bond yield has risen considerably, while the 10-year yield has fallen.",
        "Household loan growth has remained high, showing a record level on a first-half basis, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy as there remain uncertainties posed by the virus, although the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to remain at a high level for some time.",
        "In this process the Board will judge whether it is appropriate to adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, and the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (February 2021),[2)]_ _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that the domestic economy was forecast to maintain its gradual recovery but uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high.",
        "Looking at each sector, members expected exports and facilities investment to maintain their strong recoveries, thanks to the global economic recovery and improvement in the IT industry, although private consumption would recover slowly due to the worsening of household income conditions.",
        "Some members, however, presented the view that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility that worsening growth imbalances between consumption and exports/investment could widen the gaps between income groups and between industries.",
        "Members also pointed out that employment sluggishness had worsened, particularly in face-to-face services industries hit hard by the COVID-19 shock, and expressed concerns that it could take a considerable period of time for employment to get back on track.",
        "Regarding inflation, members forecast that consumer price inflation would rise slightly, owing primarily to supply-side factors including growth in food and international commodity prices, while core inflation would remain low.",
        "Members, meanwhile, emphasized that it would be necessary to pay continued attention to financial stability risks such as rising financial market volatility at home and abroad and increased leverage in the private sector.",
        "In line with this, some members noted the increased sensitivity of financial markets to changes in global financial and economic conditions and expressed the view that the possibility of sudden asset price adjustments could not be ruled out.",
        "Members also expressed the opinion that a careful watch was needed on medium and long-term monetary policy conditions, including whether the potential growth rate would decline due to the COVID-19 shock and when the output gap would be resolved, as well as changes in the inflation environment at home and abroad.",
        "Members also stressed that it would be necessary to thoroughly analyze the background behind the recent hike in long-term market interest rates and its impact on the real economy and cope with it in an appropriate manner.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the global economic recovery had been weakening somewhat due to the resurgence of COVID-19, but unlike during the early days of the pandemic, goods trade and corporate investment continued to grow and demand had been shifting relatively quickly to non-face-to-face consumption, which had been easing the economic shock from the contraction of face-to-face consumption.",
        "The member also evaluated that expectations of an economic recovery over a medium-term horizon had been growing, boosted by increasing vaccine distribution and stimulus package implementation in major countries.",
        "The member mentioned that, while the domestic economy had been showing a similar trend to those of major countries, the gap in economic activity between industries and between sectors had been widening further than originally expected, and caution was required in this regard with respect to its economic and social impacts.",
        "The member’s assessment was that attention should be paid to the rapid worsening of employment sluggishness, as shown in the employment rate sliding to a record low since the global financial crisis in January this year.",
        "The member argued that such sluggishness of employment seemed to have been caused by the negative spillover effects of the pandemic being concentrated in face-to-face service industries with higher employment inducement coefficients, rather than being felt more broadly across the macroeconomy as a whole, and went on to point out that these industries would likely see growing cases of temporary and permanent closures and downsizing of workers due to prolonged social-distancing measures, and that employment sluggishness would be felt more severely by low-income groups with higher marginal propensity to consume, which would likely limit the recovery of consumption for a considerable period of time.",
        "The member in this regard emphasized that it would be necessary to continue focusing policy on selective support for vulnerable groups while maintaining a monetary easing stance.",
        "The member meanwhile noted that there was recently growing interest in the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, and the Bank of Korea’s outright purchases of Treasury bonds in particular.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that yields on Treasury bonds, and long-term ones in particular, had been recently rising significantly at home and abroad, and given that an increase in Treasury bond issuance following the expansion of fiscal expenditure could increase financial market volatility, aggressive policy responses might be needed to stabilize the markets.",
        "The member however emphasized that attention should be paid to the fact that, since the structure and conditions of domestic capital markets were far different from those in major countries, the central bank’s intervention might not help ease the burden of funding costs on the government and businesses at the same time.",
        "The member also mentioned that, with the Base Rate remaining above 0%, unintended policy costs might be incurred while absorbing increased liquidity as a result of Treasury bond purchases.",
        "The member took the view that further monetary easing could be considered to solve this problem, but would not be appropriate given recent economic and financial conditions.",
        "The member went on to note that the output gap of the domestic economy was expected to narrow gradually, despite high uncertainty surrounding the future recovery path, and that the real policy rate was expected to decline further, considering the trends of consumer price inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "Above all, the member’s judgment was that continued caution about possible accumulation of financial imbalances was required since financial conditions had become much more accommodative and leverage in the private sector continued to increase.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% this time and to closely monitor changes in domestic and international financial and economic conditions.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite the pandemic, the domestic economy had outperformed major advanced economies last year, boosted by effective measures to combat COVID-19 and the boom in the semiconductor industry.",
        "By sector, the member noted that investment and net exports had exhibited more favorable movements than expected while private consumption had been sluggish.",
        "The member assessed that, although social controversy over fiscal space had limited fiscal expansion, increased government spending and transfer payments had served as a buffer against a decline in aggregate demand.",
        "The member forecast that the domestic economy would recover centering around exports and investment, driven by the government’s expansionary fiscal policy and the global economic recovery.",
        "The member however took the view that the pace of recovery would depend on the recovery of private consumption and employment.",
        "The member stated that households’ surplus income, in particular, had increased significantly last year, due mainly to government aid, and forecast that how much of this surplus would be allocated for spending would determine the momentum of the consumption recovery.",
        "The member meanwhile expected that employment conditions would improve compared with last year, but looking back at previous experiences, such improvement was unlikely to outpace the recovery of economic growth.",
        "The member mentioned that, since growth in non-face-to-face economic activities had become a trend and labor-saving technological advances had been speeding up since the outbreak of COVID-19, the possibility could not be ruled out of an economic structure with ever-present labor slack becoming firmly entrenched.",
        "The member in this regard pointed to the need to make up for worsening unemployment through the government’s job creation project for the time being, even if those jobs are not of high quality, and went on to argue that it would be necessary to patiently maintain accommodative monetary policy and support measures for households and SMEs until the economy shows a marked trend of recovery.",
        "The member took the view that the current pandemic had reconfirmed which social groups are most vulnerable to economic shocks.",
        "The member expressed the concern that, as seen from past experiences, shocks to vulnerable groups could linger for quite some time even following an export-driven economic recovery.",
        "The member emphasized that, as it had been reconfirmed that an economic crisis worsens inequality and polarization, it would be necessary to strengthen inclusiveness when implementing financial and monetary policies as well as tax and fiscal policies.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it was too early for now to talk about normalizing monetary policy out of concerns about inflationary pressures and a further rise in asset prices, and that macroprudential regulations and financial supervision would be of fundamental importance to financial stability.",
        "The member added that, amid disinflationary pressures, the Phillips curve had flattened in Korea over the past decade, and that, under these conditions, monetary policy should be implemented flexibly with its focus placed on stabilizing the real economy and employment.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, due to the inevitable fiscal expansion to support economic recovery and vulnerable groups for the time being and also to structural factors such as population aging, government spending would increase even further and the government’s funding costs would become an important economic issue.",
        "Taking all this into comprehensive consideration, the member argued that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level and promote stabilization of long-term market interest rates by making use of instruments such as Treasury bond purchases.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had been sustaining a modest recovery recently.",
        "The member forecast the domestic economy to sustain its recovery, led by continued export growth and improvement in facilities investment, which would more than offset a slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although the Bank of Korea’s economic outlook this time put the growth forecast for this year at 3%, the same figure as in November last year, uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high due to pandemic-related developments.",
        "The member pointed out that vaccinations and increased fiscal stimulus measures in Korea and other countries around the world were expected to have positive impacts on the domestic economy, but the possibility of a domestic spread of virus variants could not be ruled out.",
        "The member pointed out that the employment situation remained sluggish with the number of persons employed continuing to decline significantly in January, and forecast that employment would exhibit a slower-than-expected recovery.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member expected consumer price inflation to rise to the lower- to mid-1% level and core inflation to the 1% level this year, due to the gradual reflection of the effects of economic recovery in these indexes, combined with supply-side upward pressures such as hikes in international oil prices and agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.",
        "The member stated that inflation expectations among the general public had recently increased to the 2% level, and went on to argue that it would be necessary to closely monitor future trends of inflation expectations and their impacts, since inflation expectations are one of the major factors determining the medium-term inflation trend.",
        "Concerning the financial markets, meanwhile, the member mentioned that, amid the continued preference for risk assets, major price variables had fluctuated under the influence of international financial market movements.",
        "The member took the view that the recent financial market movements reflected expectations of future economic recovery, but on the other hand, they also included factors increasing financial stability risks.",
        "The member noted that the uptrend in long-term market interest rates since the second half of last year could be seen as a process ofeconomic recovery and resolution of low inflation.",
        "The member assessed that the sustained asset price rises and household debt growth despite the substantial increase in long-term market interest rates were attributable mainly to interest rates remaining accommodative and to expectations of major countries’ accommodative monetary policy stances continuing for the time being.",
        "The member however expressed the view that it should be noted that some global financial market movements reflected the possibility of the US Federal Reserve’s early monetary policy normalization and that there were growing concerns about the possibility of drastic asset price adjustments in the event of changes in global financial and economic conditions.",
        "In conclusion, the member judged that, although the domestic economy was forecast to maintain a modest recovery, it would be necessary to maintain the monetary easing stance for the time being, considering the continued high macroeconomic uncertainties concerning pandemic-related developments and the continued sluggishness of the employment situation.",
        "The member added that in doing so it would be important to continue closely monitoring changes in financial stability risks.",
        "The member in this regard argued that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member noted that domestic exports and investment had improved since the previous meeting thanks to economic recovery in major countries, but private consumption had weakened more than expected, influenced by the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although the Bank of Korea had kept its economic growth outlook for 2021 unchanged this time, growth imbalances had deepened, as seen in the gap between exports and domestic demand, the polarization of exports and investment among industries, and the differentiation in private consumption by income group and age.",
        "Above all, the member raised the concern that the gap between growth and employment had expanded to an unprecedented degree due to worsened employment conditions, particularly among self-employed and temporary workers, with the decline in the number of persons employed reaching 980,000 in January.",
        "The member pointed out that these growth imbalances were highly likely to continue even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative stance for some time.",
        "Looking at prices, the member stated that, although the outlook for consumer price inflation for this year had been revised slightly upward, that for core inflation was at household and corporate lending had actually grown, on the back of expectations for rising asset prices and continuing demand for living expenses, showing a so-called counter-cyclical trend.",
        "The member thus assessed the risk in terms of financial imbalances to have increased.",
        "The member noted that the situations in the real economy and financial stability were serving as conflicting factors for monetary policy decisions, but found it appropriate to maintain the current level of the Base Rate and focus more on domestic demand and price conditions at this juncture.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that the Bank of Korea should examine overall risk factors through cooperation with the government and the supervisory authorities to prevent the risk of financial imbalances from excessively heightening, and consistently push for macroprudential policy measures.",
        "The member also added that it would be necessary to pay attention to and analyze the possibility of a decline in the potential growth rate of the domestic economy in line with the COVID-19 shock and natural population decline, and the consequent changes in trends in the output gap.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that there was an increasing need for fiscal policy to take on an expanded role, and for it to be supported through cooperation with monetary policy, given economic conditions of late.",
        "The member also noted the growing importance of the Bank of Korea’s role in stabilizing market interest rates.",
        "The member, however, saw that the recent rise in long-term market interest rates had been affected by rising US Treasury bond yields which had preemptively reflected expectations for economic recovery in the US, and the upward pressures were highly likely to continue in the future.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be appropriate to devote efforts to curb excessive volatility of market interest rates, instead of directly addressing demand and supply conditions.",
        "The member added that the feasibility of funding plans stemming from expanded government spending should be discussed, in consideration of the “fiscal trilemma,” i.e.",
        "the difficulty of simultaneously achieving the three goals of fiscal expansion, fiscal soundness, and tax reduction.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "The member assessed that, as the resurgence of COVID-19 weakened somewhat, the global economy was showing a moderate trend of recovery, bolstered by ongoing fiscal stimulus by major advanced economies, and the domestic economy was also maintaining a trend of recovery, albeit modest.",
        "The member saw that, by sector, private consumption had contracted more deeply than expected due to the ongoing spread of coronavirus in winter, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area where economic activities were concentrated.",
        "The member also expected the future recovery path to be gradual due to constraints including delayed improvement in income conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, the member saw that economic recovery would expand gradually in the future as exports, in the semiconductor industry in particular, appeared set to maintain robust growth, facilities investment showed favorable movements, and the slump in construction investment eased.",
        "The member projected that consumer price inflation would rise to the mid-1% level, as rising international oil and grain prices would have an impact with some time lag going forward and economic normalization would lead to an increase in demand-side pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that the sluggishness in employment had deepened with the amount of decrease in the number of persons employed rising greatly in January, against the backdrop of growth in both the number of the unemployed and the number of persons on temporary leave due to the prolongation of the pandemic.",
        "The member noted that the number of persons employed had declined drastically in the face-to-face service industries in particular, due for instance to stronger social-distancing measures, and there were increased closures of self-employed businesses of late.",
        "The member thus raised the concern that the pace of recovery in employment could be constrained even after the pandemic eases.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that dealing with this issue by selectively supporting damaged sectors through fiscal policy would be more effective than using monetary policy, the effects of which would be indiscriminate across all sectors.",
        "The member stated that there remained considerable uncertainties surrounding the recovery path of the domestic economy, such as delayed improvements of household consumption conditions following worsened employment conditions, as well as pandemic-related developments such as vaccine supply, innoculations, and coronavirus variants.",
        "The member thus saw that it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance until the economy exhibits a more clearly marked recovery, and in this regard it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period.",
        "However, the member stressed the need to continually pay attention to the accumulation of potential factors threatening financial stability in the future including rapid growth in household debt, expansion in corporate credit, and a sustained rise in real estate prices resulting from the continuation of accommodative financial conditions.",
        "The member added that, if the domestic economy enters a full-fledged recovery phase in the future, the implementation of monetary policy should be reviewed with greater focus on financial stability.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "Looking at economic developments since the January MPB meeting, the member assessed that growth in major countries was gradually improving, thanks for instance to fiscal stimulus packages and the rollout of vaccines in major countries.",
        "Concerning global trade, the member expected trade in goods to steadily improve, despite the prospect for sustained sluggishness in trade in services.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic real economy was moving in conjunction with the developments of COVID-19.",
        "Looking at sectors, the member saw that, concerning private consumption, consumption of face-to-face services had been sluggish due mainly to containment measures, and overseas spending was unlikely to reverse course for a considerable time.",
        "Meanwhile, the member projected that facilities investment in the IT sector would be solid, and that in the non-IT sector would grow moderately, led by investment in maintenance and repair, while construction investment would reverse to an increase this year from the current decrease.",
        "The member also forecast that exports would remain favorable going forward, thanks to a gradual global economic upturn and significant improvement in the semiconductor industry.",
        "Meanwhile, looking at employment, the member stated that the number of persons employed had decreased greatly following the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member raised the concern that the employment slump in self-employed businesses focused on face-to-face services would deepen, which was highly likely to have negative impacts over a long period of time, although employment in the manufacturing sector was likely to increase, led by an upturn in the IT industry.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to increase this year due to rising international oil prices and agricultural product prices.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, since uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy were very high, it would be necessary to thoroughly monitor potential upside and downside risk factors.",
        "Since there was a growing possibility of a supplementary budget being compiled in the future, the member stressed the need to analyze the extent to which it would contribute to the recovery of the real economy.",
        "The member also noticed that consumer price inflation was still running below the inflation target despite an upward revision this time and the outlook for core inflation remained unchanged at the 1.0% level.",
        "The member thus stated that considerable time was likely needed before the negative output gap turned positive, even if the domestic economy showed a moderate recovery.",
        "The member judged that it would be necessary to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance going forward.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the international financial markets were showing stability, and the domestic financial and FX markets were also stable, but volatility had increased of late.",
        "The member stressed the need for thorough monitoring, since market participants had become much more sensitive to the outlooks for the US economy and inflation and the related direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member assessed that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",

        "economy has remained slow due to the ongoing influence of the movement restrictions following the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "In global financial markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased, mainly driven by the expectations for economic recovery following the expansion of vaccinations and the prospect of a further fiscal stimulus package by the new US administration.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "consumption has remained weak as social distancing has been prolonged, exports have sustained their buoyancy led by the IT sector and facilities investment has continued to recover.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, as the number of persons employed declined sharply compared to the corresponding period last year.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery, led by exports and investment.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the November forecast.",
        "prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products were offset by factors such as the decreasing prices of public services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the mid-0% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to mid-1% level this year, exceeding the November forecast of 1.0%, largely reflecting the increase in global oil prices and gradual improvement in economic activity.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to run at around 1%.",
        "won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "Stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by both expectations for economic recovery and caution about the recent rally.",

        "and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that the domestic economy continued its recovery, driven by exports and investment.",
        "Members expected private consumption to sustain its recovery, influenced by vaccinations and the consequent expansion of economic activity, and the execution of a supplementary budget.",
        "Some members expressed the view that a close watch should be kept on the possibility that external risk factors, such as concerns about slower growth in the Chinese economy, global supply chain disruptions, and rising energy prices, could affect the domestic economy.",
        "In terms of inflation, members assessed that upside risks had grown due to bottlenecks in the global supply chain combined with recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Some members presented the opinion that, since the current rising prices were affected not only by supply-side pressures, but also by demand-side pressures, the trend of inflation expectations should be observed, while attention should be paid to the possibility of upward inflationary pressures persisting for a long time.",
        "Members, meanwhile, assessed that, although prices of some financial assets had undergone corrections due to stronger expectations for policy rate hikes at home and abroad, financial conditions still remained accommodative.",
        "Some members commented that high household lending growth and the trend of housing price increases were ongoing, despite the August Base Rate hike and the government’s efforts to strengthen macroprudential policy measures.",
        "Members went on to argue the need to monitor cautiously the trend of widening financial imbalances, particularly in the household sector.",
        "Members also stressed the need to pay close attention to the effects of the August Base Rate hike, the impacts of global inflation on domestic prices, and the increase in the contribution of household credit to M2 growth.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level, while some members argued for raising it to One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member assessed that, although the global economy was continuing its solid recovery, led by advanced economies, the growth momentum had somewhat slowed, due to the spread of virus variants, production disruptions caused by supply chain bottlenecks, and real estate risk and power shortages in China.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was maintaining recovery overall, led by exports and investment, despite the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member noted that private consumption was continuing to recover, thanks to expansion of vaccinations and the provision of emergency relief funds, and facilities investment also remained solid, led by the IT sector.",
        "However, the member commented that construction investment had been somewhat sluggish due to weather conditions.",
        "The member added that exports continued to rise, bolstered by solid demand from major economies and increases in unit export prices.",
        "The member expected the GDP growth rate for this year to be generally consistent with the August projection since negative external risks, such as global supply disruptions, global inflation, and a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, were predicted to be offset by the possibility of an expansion in domestic demand following a transition in the disease control system in the fourth quarter.",
        "The member commented that consumer price inflation had stayed at the mid-2% level due to the accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and of services, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public remained at the 2.4% level and the long-term inflation expectations of experts had risen close to 2%.",
        "Concerning international financial markets, the member assessed that investment sentiment had worsened, as upward inflationary pressures were persisting longer than expected, and the possibility of changes in monetary policies of major economies, and a risk related to real estate in China had emerged.",
        "The member judged that, although the domestic financial market was continuing its stable trend overall, financial conditions still remained accommodative.",
        "The member pointed out that high lending growth and housing price increases were ongoing, and inflows of ample market liquidity into risky assets were being observed.",
        "With respect to domestic and international policy conditions, the member called attention to the point that longer-than-expected supply disruptions were affecting growth and inflation simultaneously.",
        "However, the member saw that if bottlenecks in the supply chain gradually ease in the future, this would combine with the excessive savings built up so far and consumption boosting policy measures to strengthen growth engines again.",
        "Concerning the domestic and international inflation trends, the member expressed the need for continued attention to the impacts on inflation of structural factors, such as demand-side inflationary pressures, climate change, and the restructuring of the global supply framework, as well as to the effects of rising housing prices on housing costs after a time lag.",
        "The member added that it was necessary to cautiously watch the possibility of recently rising prices leading to increases in inflation expectations and wages or the possibility of inflationary pressures persisting for a long time due to the pass-through of rising production costs to prices.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic trends, it would be appropriate for the Bank of Korea to maintain its basic direction of gradual adjustments to the degree of monetary policy accommodation, as has been communicated with the market since May this year.",
        "However, the member judged that it would be proper to hold the Base Rate at its current level at the present meeting to observe for a little longer the impacts on the domestic economic recovery and financial market conditions after the August Base Rate hike, recent developments in external factors causing economic instability, and their impacts on the domestic economy.",
        "However, the member added that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate again at the next meeting if there were no new factors related to domestic and international economic conditions and the current economic trend continued until the next MPB meeting.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member saw that the global economy was sustaining a solid recovery, led by advanced economies, and it would maintain a trend of recovery going forward, as the spread of the global pandemic would slow.",
        "However, the member noted that the differentiated economic recoveries among countries and industries persisted, working to worsen adverse effects such as global supply chain disruptions and rising energy prices.",
        "The member argued that this supply shock was acting to constrain recovery in global demand and to raise concern about global inflation through overshooting of prices of some items.",
        "The member presented the view that it was important to prevent the spread of higher inflation expectations, as well as to sustain the recovery of global demand to ensure a successful soft landing of the global economy in the future.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was generally favorable due to the ongoing recoveries in exports and investment in particular, and the relatively gradual decline in private consumption.",
        "The member commented that exports were sustaining high growth in various items, thus driving growth in facilities investment.",
        "The member expected the trend of recovery in private consumption to strengthen further, thanks to relaxation of social distancing measures and sluggishness that was less severe than expected despite the resurgence of the pandemic.",
        "The member assessed upside risks to the consumer inflation outlook to have increased.",
        "The member pointed out that, although upside pressures on prices were mainly attributable to factors less directly related to domestic monetary policy, such as rising import prices in line with global inflation, and a sustained rise in food prices, rising prices were spreading to more items due to the materialization of the second round effects of price increases, such as rising dining-out prices and higher electricity charges, combined with upward inflationary pressure stemming from recovery in demand.",
        "The member estimated that the growth rate of the actual cost of living would be higher if owners’ equivalent rent and trends of administered prices were taken into account.",
        "The member also noted that short-term inflation expectations had risen to the mid-2% level.",
        "Therefore, the member presented the view that closer attention should be kept on upside risks to the future inflation trend.",
        "The member assessed that the risk appetite and leveraged investment of economic agents were continuing in the financial market.",
        "The member raised the concern that, although stock and bond prices had fallen due to the Evergrande Group issue in China and concerns about global inflation, market liquidity was continuing to expand, with the volume of net equity purchases by individuals using loans on margin accounts actually increasing, household and corporate lending continuing to grow and M2 growth rising to the mid-12% level.",
        "The member added that, despite the strengthening of the government’s supervisory measures, household lending continued to show a large increase exceeding the monthly average for the last year, and was driving housing price growth in conjunction with expectations of further increases in housing prices.",
        "The member judged that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, given growing concerns from the inflation and financial stability perspectives, although the real economy had been running above the projected path since August.",
        "The member presented the view that, even if the Base Rate was raised further, it would still be below the pre-pandemic level and thus was unlikely to constrain economic recovery, and would actually help deal with financial imbalances by easing risk appetite.",
        "In addition, the member expected adjustments to the degree of excessive monetary policy accommodation to improve national competitiveness in the post-pandemic era, enhance productivity through effective allocation of resources, and promote stable growth in the medium- to long-term by addressing asset imbalances.",
        "However, the member added that it was necessary to continue policy efforts to cushion the shock in the face-to-face services industries hit hardest by the pandemic.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75%.",
        "On the global economic front, the member noted that global trade was showing a solid recovery despite existing risks such as uncertainties originating in China, slow recoveries in other emerging market economies, rising energy prices, and supply and demand imbalances.",
        "The member projected the global economy to sustain its sound recovery, particularly in advanced economies.",
        "The member assessed that, despite the resurgence of COVID-19, the domestic economy was sustaining a recovery, led by exports and investment, employment continued to improve in terms of the number of persons employed, and private consumption was recovering, backed by the execution of a supplementary budget and the expansion of vaccinations.",
        "The member commented that, although the leading economic index had declined slightly of late, this should not be interpreted as a secular decline.",
        "The member expected the trend of recovery in the overall domestic economy including face-to-face services industries to continue if the transition to the new disease control policy scheme was undertaken.",
        "The member judged that, although the foreign exchange and financial sectors were affected by external risks, these risks were not yet cause for concern.",
        "The member saw that, while long-term interest rates at home and abroad had risen sharply in reflection of global inflation and changes in monetary policy stances, and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, foreign investment in domestic securities had shifted to a net inflow, backed by positive assessments of the domestic economy, and foreign currency liquidity had been managed appropriately.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that from the inflation and exchange rate perspectives, developments in external risk factors should be closely monitored.",
        "Concerning the Base Rate decision at the current juncture, the member expressed the opinion that close attention should be paid to two factors in particular.",
        "First, the member focused on the impacts of global inflation on domestic prices.",
        "The member saw that prices were maintaining a strong upward trend in most countries, and these price rises were high even when base effects were taken into consideration.",
        "On the domestic front, the member noted that consumer price inflation had been continuing to increase since April to run above 2%, and core inflation and inflation expectations had also risen.",
        "The member pointed out that, if the rise in housing costs driven by housing price growth was reflected in consumer prices after a time lag, prices felt by the general public could increase further.",
        "However, the member presented the opinion that there was no great need to respond to price rises immediately with a Base Rate hike at the current juncture.",
        "First, the member found it necessary to observe for a little longer to see if global inflation would persist for a long time.",
        "The member commented that the domestic price trend should be monitored, while consideration should be given to the price levels and trends in past cases of above-target inflation during the past 10 years or so.",
        "The member added that, in doing so, inflation inertia should also be kept in mind.",
        "The member then saw that household lending and housing prices were posing the biggest potential risks at the moment.",
        "The member raised the concern that excessively high leverage and housing prices could reduce consumption and investment capacities and worsen economic inequalities in the long term.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the Base Rate was a very powerful policy instrument which impacts the entire economy and thus greatly affect leverage and expectations of housing price increases, it was not the only instrument that could affect the two variables, and other policy instruments or a mix of the Base Rate and other instruments could be more effective at times.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to observe the effects of the Base Rate hike and the government’s measures to manage household debt for now before considering additional measures, since the Base Rate had already been raised in August and lending growth was showing signs of moderating due to the recent increase in lending rates and the strengthening of household debt management by the government and the financial sector.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to maintain solid growth, but saw that the upward and downward uncertainties surrounding the growth path were both high.",
        "The member thus found it desirable to observe the effects of the previous Base Rate hike, and the future trend of recovery, as well as how uncertainties related to global inflation and the monetary policy stances of major economies would play out, before taking an additional policy measure.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, since the COVID-19 shock had been asymmetric, fiscal support and bank intermediated lending support, which allow selective support for vulnerable groups, should be continued.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of 0.75%.",
        "Looking at the changes in domestic and external conditions since the previous MPB meeting, the member assessed that the global economy was maintaining a sound recovery and inflation had been accelerating, and forecast that the global economy would grow at a faster pace than its potential growth rate for the time being, boosted largely by the expansion of vaccinations and major countries’ stimulus measures.",
        "As to the domestic economy, the member judged that the momentum of economic recovery had slowed temporarily due to the resurgence of COVID-19, but this would have only a limited negative impact on aggregate demand and the underlying economic trend over a medium-term horizon.",
        "In determining the monetary policy direction in these macroeconomic conditions, the member took notice of the following matters.",
        "First, the member assessed that downside economic risks posed by the pandemic had been decreasing as the correlation between the pandemic and economic activities had weakened significantly.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although the recovery of private consumption had slowed with the strengthening of disease control measures since July, the degree of sluggishness had been more modest than originally expected, thanks to the learning effect from previous experiences and a rapid shift to non-face-to-face consumption, and improvement in employment conditions had also not been severely affected.",
        "The member noted that, most of all, the conditions for a rebound in consumption were being created, as disease control measures were expected to be partly eased, the government’s policies to support household income and boost consumption had continued, and consumer sentiment had improved somewhat.",
        "Second, the member evaluated that upside risks to inflation had continued to expand.",
        "The member mentioned that the rise in prices of raw materials could last longer than expected, due to the combined effect of the recovery in global demand and supply disruptions, and the exchange rate had risen, all of which had added to upside risks to inflation.",
        "The member also noted that consumer price inflation was highly likely to exceed the level forecast in August, due to the increasing demand-side inflationary pressures in line with the underlying trend of economic recovery.",
        "Finally, the member pointed out that financial imbalances were continuing to accumulate amid the accommodative financial conditions.",
        "The member mentioned that the continued decline in the Korean won’s effective exchange rate, not seen during normal economic recovery phases, made financial conditions more accommodative absent a liquidity crunch in the FX swap market, and strengthened the effect of accommodative monetary policy through direct impacts on exports and inflation.",
        "The member stated that, since risk-off sentiment had been strengthening recently at home and abroad, prices of some financial assets had been adjusted and the gap between such prices and fundamentals had narrowed somewhat, but credit to the private sector and housing prices remained on the rise and debt and housing prices relative to income continued to grow, and in this regard, monetary policy responses should be maintained in consideration of the risk of financial imbalances.",
        "The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current level of rate hikes limiting the economic upswing, their medium- and long-term benefits would outweigh their short-term costs, when the unusually accommodative financial conditions were taken into consideration.",
        "The member however took the view that selective support for vulnerable sectors should be maintained since rate hikes could increase interest repayment burdens on sole proprietors and small businesses, while to prepare for a possible structural change in the pattern of face-to-face consumption, measures for related industries should be developed from medium- and long-term perspectives so that the growth potential would not be undermined.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy had continued to recover along with the rising vaccination rate, but the pace of growth had slowed somewhat, particularly in the United States and China, due to the surge in the prices of international oil and other raw materials and supply chain disruptions.",
        "The member saw the domestic economy as remaining on the path of recovery, led by exports and facilities investment, and consumption as recovering boosted by the rising vaccination rate, the easing of social-distancing measures and financial support.",
        "The member however pointed out that strong growth was unlikely in the fourth quarter, as the manufacturing Business Sentiment Index had declined for the second consecutive month and construction investment remained sluggish.",
        "The member mentioned that, although employment conditions had been improving gradually, the numbers of available potential job seekers and employed persons in time-related underemployment remained high.",
        "The member stated that consumer price inflation had remained above 2%, but this had been led primarily by rises in energy and grocery prices, and the Research Department projected core inflation for this year at around 1.2%.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, although 4% growth would materialize and inflation would exceed 2% this year as forecast by the Research Department, it would be insufficient to use this as a basis for raising the Base Rate.",
        "The member presented the view that, since GDP for this year would be only 3% higher than its pre-COVID-19 level recorded in 2019 and private consumption was likely to return to its pre-COVID-19 level in the second half of next year at the earliest, it would be necessary to wait a little longer to see whether GDP growth led primarily by exports and the manufacturing sector would lead to expansions in household income, wages, employment and consumption.",
        "More specifically, the member emphasized that, since the COVID-19 shock had been asymmetrical, affecting the services sector more severely than the manufacturing sector, the recovery of the services sector and domestic demand would serve as a more important basis for determining whether to adjust the monetary policy path.",
        "The member meanwhile emphasized that inequality and polarization had worsened even further while overcoming the Global Financial Crisis through the expansion of exports, and expressed concerns that the economic recovery could lose its momentum if it were concluded that the crisis is over by looking solely at aggregate indicators, such as GDP or the output gap, or if an impatient approach were taken toward shifting to monetary policy tightening based only on cost-push inflation.",
        "The member argued that, concerning the current crisis in particular, the pace of easing of disease-control and social-distancing measures would be an important factor in making monetary policy decisions, and that a close watch should be kept on the evolution of downside risks to the global economy in line with energy price hikes and supply chain disruptions.",
        "The member added that it would not be too late to shift to full-scale tightening after examining the impact of the US Fed’s tapering on financial markets.",
        "The member presented the view that, although various circles were pointing out the buildup of financial imbalances that are specific to the domestic economy, real estate policy should be used to achieve housing market stability and macroprudential policy to stabilize household debt, and went on to stress the need to hold to this principle patiently to solve a structural problem that had been building up for a long time.",
        "Another member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member’s judgment was that the domestic economy had recently sustained its sound recovery, as exports had maintained robust growth, facilities investment had shown solid improvement particularly in the IT sector, and private consumption had got back on a recovery track boosted by accelerated vaccinations and improved consumer sentiment following emergency relief payments.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to sustain growth consistent with the path forecast in August, led by continued strong exports and solid growth in investment as well as a gradual recovery in consumption.",
        "The member forecast that Korea would see exports and investment grow with major countries speeding up normalization of economic activities, and that the recovery of consumption, and face-to-face consumption in particular, would strengthen gradually as disease-control measures in Korea were eased step by step.",
        "The member concluded that, although there remained uncertainties related to COVID-19 developments and concerns were growing about a prolongation of global supply bottlenecks and a Chinese economic slowdown, these would have only limited impacts on the future growth path of the domestic economy.",
        "The member forecast consumer price inflation to be somewhat above the path forecast in August and sustain its strong uptrend at around the mid-2% level for the time being, and core inflation to rise to the upper-1% level affected chiefly by the increased demand-side upward pressures following the economic recovery.",
        "The member expected a further rise in inflationary pressures in Korea, as upside risks to global inflation were partly materializing due to the recent signs of a prolongation of supply bottlenecks and the resurgence in international raw material prices.",
        "The member meanwhile noted that housing prices had sustained strong growth and home-buyer sentiment and expectations of further housing price rises had also remained strong.",
        "The member considered recent financial conditions as having remained accommodative.",
        "Concerning the financial markets, the member pointed out that risk preferences had been weakening somewhat, with interest rates rising substantially and stock prices falling on the back of strengthening expectations of policy rate hikes at home and abroad, while M2 growth had accelerated led by the expansion in private-sector credit supply.",
        "The member stated that the contribution of private-sector credit to M2 growth showed a sharp rise, and judged that this had been attributable largely to the continued substantial uptrend in household loans, and housing-related loans in particular, and that the government’s effort to strengthen macroprudential policy and the Bank of Korea’s Base Rate hike in August had not helped to significantly curb the widening of financial imbalances centering around the household sector.",
        "The member argued that, given that the Korean economy was forecast to sustain a strong recovery, inflation had been increasing to a greater extent than originally expected and the risks posed by the buildup of financial imbalances were growing, it would be desirable to continue the monetary policy normalization begun in August.",
        "The member however mentioned that, considering that economic agents including the self-employed, having difficulties going through the pandemic situation, would need some time to adapt to changing conditions such as a higher Base Rate, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 0.75% this time.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the veiws of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Lim, Jiwon and Dr.",
        "Suh, Young Kyung expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level and argued for raising it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision □ The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "to recover despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have increased steeply and the US dollar has strengthened while stock prices have fallen, amid growing concerns over the prospect of prolonged global inflation and the rising possibility of the US Federal Reserve’s tapering within the year.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued its robust trend.",
        "Private consumption has recently shown improvement again, after having slowed due to the coronavirus resurgence.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery as private consumption is forecast to improve gradually, affected by vaccinations and the consequent expansion of economic activity as well as the execution of a supplementary budget, while exports and investment are expected to sustain their buoyancy.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in August.",
        "accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and of services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-1% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the mid-2% level for some time, exceeding the path projected in August, before declining somewhat.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to increase to around the upper-1% level.",
        "won to US dollar exchange rate have risen significantly while stock prices have fallen considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "The increase in household loans remains at a high level, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above 2% for some time, despite ongoing uncertainties over the virus.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ Members forecast that the domestic economy would remain favorable despite the resurgence of COVID-19, as exports and investment were expected to sustain their buoyancy while consumption had not contracted significantly, affected by the expansion of vaccinations, the learning effect of economic agents concerning the pandemic, and the execution of a supplementary budget.",
        "One member, meanwhile, noted the possibility of a sales decrease and worsening employment sluggishness in the face-to-face services industry in August and September and expressed the view that it would be necessary to monitor the services industry's business conditions and job recovery trend rather than aggregate indicators such as GDP.",
        "Concerning inflation, members forecast that consumer price inflation would increase to the lower-2% level this year, boosted by gradually increasing inflationary pressures on both the supply and demand sides.",
        "Some members evaluated that there were huge upside risks to the price path, noting the possibility of inflation exceeding its forecast for this year influenced chiefly by the uptrend of processed food and dining-out prices and the rise in the exchange rate, and emphasized the need to examine underlying inflation over a medium-term horizon.",
        "Members meanwhile assessed that, amid the continued accommodative financial conditions, household debt and housing prices continued to grow, and mentioned that, due to the accelerating accumulation of financial imbalances in the household sector in particular affected by the sustained risk appetite and over-concentration of capital in the asset market, it might be difficult to properly curb such acceleration solely with macroprudential policy, which is dependent on institutional regulations.",
        "Members also expressed concerns about the possibility of the recent strengthening of household debt management creating a balloon effect in which borrowers flock to the non-banking sector and also leading to a hard landing of household debt, and took the view that attention should be paid to possible negative effects of the household debt issue on economic growth.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Some members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%, while one member argued for keeping it unchanged at its current level.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was maintaining sound recovery despite the resurgence of COVID-19, and forecast that consumption would improve gradually while exports and investment would remain buoyant.",
        "The member expected that, although uncertainties related to COVID-19 were unlikely to be resolved in a short period of time, restrictions on economic activities, such as face-to-face consumption, would be eased gradually, boosted by the significant expansion of vaccinations for young adults and middle-aged people.",
        "The member added that, taking this into account, the Research Department forecast Korea’s growth rate for this year to be at around 4%.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to be at the lower-2% level this year, much higher than the May forecast, with supply-side upward pressures lasting for longer than originally expected and service charges growing at a faster pace, and also expected core inflation to be in the low- to mid-1% range, affected chiefly by increasing demand-side upward pressures following economic recovery, and then to rise gradually.",
        "The member meanwhile assessed that housing prices had been growing more rapidly, particularly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and housing purchase sentiment was also strengthening based on expectations for a further rise in housing prices.",
        "Concerning financial markets, the member noted that liquidity continued to exhibit a sharp increase, as M2 growth had remained strong since July amid the sustained highly accommodative financial conditions since the second half of last year.",
        "The member added that household loans had been increasing significantly across financial institutions, and the corporate sector had been also expanding fund-raising through the corporate bond and stock markets as well as through borrowing from banks.",
        "The member presented the view that the recent liquidity growth had been seen in the financial system as a whole and the accumulation of financial imbalances had been accordingly accelerating in the household sector in particular, which seemed unlikely to be curbed properly by macroprudential policy alone.",
        "The member judged that, considering that prices had been showing higher growth than originally expected amid the sustained strong recovery of the domestic economy and financial stability risk had been worsening combined with liquidity growth, it would be difficult to delay any further the normalization of monetary policy, which had been eased to an unusual level.",
        "The member noted that, if adjustment to the monetary policy stance were delayed in the current environment, the drastic policy adjustment that might occur in the future could increase the volatility of asset market and real economy and aggravate difficulties of vulnerable groups.",
        "The member took the view that, if the current monetary easing stance continues, its negative side effects on the economy as a whole could be larger than its effect of supporting vulnerable groups, and in this regard, it would be necessary to use fiscal and financial support measures ensuring selective resource allocation for these groups.",
        "The member presented the view that as the first step toward normalizing monetary policy at a level appropriate for stable growth of the domestic economy, it would therefore be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%.",
        "The member however added that the pace and timing of further monetary policy adjustment should be determined based on close monitoring of future changes in growth and inflation trends, as well as of financial imbalances.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite the resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad since July, the degree of contraction in economic activity had been limited compared with previous waves, affected by the expansion of vaccinations.",
        "The member expected major economies including the US, Europe and China to maintain modest recovery, boosted largely by expanded fiscal expenditure and improved employment, despite a slowdown in sentiment indices and in consumption growth.",
        "On the domestic front, the member’s forecast was that, although consumption of face-to-face services had shifted to a decline, private consumption growth would be just slightly below the originally forecast path in the second half of this year, boosted chiefly by growth in alternative consumption and the effect of a supplementary budget.",
        "The member also expected that, with exports and investment keeping up their robust growth, the economic growth rate for this year would remain at around 4% as originally forecast and the output gap, having remained negative since the first quarter of last year, would shift back to positive early next year.",
        "With regard to consumer price inflation, the member forecast that, with supply-side upward pressures increasing and the spillover effects of agricultural and livestock product price rises becoming apparent amid the recovery of demand, inflation would exceed 2% for the first time since 2012.",
        "The member also expected that core inflation excluding administered prices would also come in at the upper-1% level, and estimated that core inflation felt by the general public would be higher when taking into account the recent sharp rise in owners’ equivalent rent that is excluded from the consumer price statistics.",
        "Concerning financial markets, meanwhile, the member pointed out that risk appetite was strengthening and the over-concentration of capital in the asset market was continuing, and estimated that the household credit-to-GDP ratio had risen even further with the household debt growth rate from January to July reaching the record high and the household debt growth rate far exceeding the economic growth rate this year.",
        "The member added that, unlike in the past when a rise in leasehold deposit prices had translated into an increase in housing sales prices after which the latter declined with a time lag, an unusual situation was continuing in which both housing sales and leasehold deposit prices exhibited strong growth at the same time, and dependence on external funding for housing leasehold deposits and housing purchases had been strengthening gradually.",
        "The member noted that the Korean stock market had seen the highest rate of stock price growth among major countries since March last year, while leveraged investment was continuing with the outstanding amount of individuals’ loans on margin accounts recording the highest level in history.",
        "The member pointed out that such accumulation of financial imbalances had worked to strengthen procyclicality in the financial sector and increase the vulnerability of the Korean economy to internal and external shocks in the future.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in overall consideration of these macroeconomic and financial stability conditions, there was less need for an accommodative monetary policy stance in terms of growth and prices and a greater need to reduce the degree of monetary easing in terms of financial stability.",
        "The member judged that in this regard it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member expected that, despite a slight increase in the Base Rate in the current environment, growth and prices would remain on their forecast paths, and the Base Rate adjustment would help achieve financial stability by easing risk appetites and thereby curbing leveraged investment, mitigating the inefficient distribution of resources and curbing capital outflows.",
        "The member however mentioned that, since a rise in interest rates was highly likely to increase interest repayment burdens on vulnerable groups at a time when there remained high uncertainties related to COVID-19, it would be necessary to strengthen coordination with other policies such as fiscal policy and the Bank Intermediated Suppor t Facility.",
        "The member also added that the accumulation of financial imbalances, such as housing price hikes, household debt growth and a rise in the number of marginal firms, had resulted from the combination of various factors, including not just monetary policy but also real estate policy and changes in the economic structure, and in this regard, it would be necessary to come up with more consistent and effective policy over a medium- to long-term horizon.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that, since the previous MPB meeting, the global economy was continuing its sound recovery, driven by normalization of economic activity in major advanced countries, while the gap in economic activity among countries had been widening again.",
        "On the domestic front, the member noted that the slowing trend of recovery in consumption due to stronger social distancing measures stemming from the spread of COVID-19 could disrupt the trend of economic recovery for some time.",
        "Looking at external economic conditions and various high frequency indicators, however, the member judged that the recent strengthening of social distancing measures would have limited negative impacts on the trend of economic recovery over a medium-term horizon.",
        "Most importantly, the member noted that exports had maintained solid growth, bolstered by the trend of global economic recovery, and the correlation between the spread of COVID-19 and economic activity had weakened greatly compared to past waves of the virus.",
        "The member added that the slowdown of the consumption recovery was not expected to continue past the middle of the fourth quarter, since vaccines had been proven to be effective in preventing severe cases, and the domestic vaccination rollout had gathered pace of late.",
        "The member noted that the pattern of developments in the real economy this time was differentiated, to some extent, from those seen in past waves of the virus and in the initial outbreak in particular, and commented that this implied that there was not a great need to maintain the unusually accommodative monetary policy which had been adopted in response to the pandemic.",
        "Concerning consumer prices, the member noted that inflationary pressures on the supply side, such as petroleum product prices and agricultural and marine product prices, remained greater than expected, and inflationary pressures on the demand side had also increased gradually.",
        "The member thus assessed that the possibility could not be ruled out that consumer price inflation would exceed the target for a longer period of time than the Research Department’s current projection.",
        "Turning to the financial market, the member stated that financial imbalance risk was growing due to more accommodative financial conditions and continued yield-seeking behavior through increased leverage.",
        "The member expressed wariness in particular about the negative impacts of housing price growth and accelerated growth in household credit.",
        "The member pointed out that the domestic household sector had little experience in deleveraging, the household debt-to-income ratio in Korea was running well above the average for major advanced countries, and the disparity of Korea’s housing price-to-income ratio (PIR) from its long-term equilibrium level had widened significantly.",
        "The member judged that if these risks were not appropriately managed, they could undermine future economic growth and financial stability through a potential increase in debt repayment burdens, the possibility of drastic asset price adjustments, and inefficient resource allocation, and that in this regard it was time to make monetary policy responses, while at the same time implementing existing macroprudential measures.",
        "The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, despite the ongoing spread of the virus, a partial reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation while paying more attention to the risk of financial imbalances would be consistent with the medium- to long-term objectives of monetary policy, given the policy signals provided to date, economic and inflation trends, and financial conditions.",
        "However, the member added that, since the economic impacts of COVID-19 had been concentrated in certain face-to-face industries, selective support through use of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility should be continued and expanded, while in-depth discussion on long-term industrial policy measures and fiscal support would be needed to prepare for the possibility of structural changes in consumption patterns.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current level of 0.50%.",
        "On the global economic front, the member assessed that the US and other advanced countries had sustained strong recoveries overall, despite the spread of the Delta variant.",
        "In terms of the domestic economy, the member saw that the disease control measures which had strengthened due to the fourth wave of COVID-19 were continuing longer than expected, and thus production and consumption would likely be affected, particularly in the face-to-face service industries.",
        "However, the member expected the degree of contraction in consumption this time would not be greater than those during the past waves, while exports and facilities investment in particular would continue their solid recoveries.",
        "The member expected economic growth for this year to be around 4%, given real GDP growth through the second quarter of this year, construction and facilities investment and export trends, future vaccination plans, and the supplementary budget.",
        "The member projected that employment would continue to increase and consumer price inflation for this year would reach the lower-2% level.",
        "The member noted that although volatility had expanded somewhat of late, led by stock prices, the exchange rate, and long-term interest rates, the FX and financial markets had generally remained stable.",
        "The member commented that risk preference and the buildup in financial imbalances were continuing due to the ongoing accommodative financial market conditions after the previous year’s two Base Rate cuts.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, despite these economic trends, the Base Rate decision at the current meeting would not be an easy one since uncertainties surrounding the future economic growth path still remained high, due to the possibility that new virus variants would emerge and to the prolonged fourth wave of the coronavirus.",
        "The member commented that the deepening buildup of financial imbalances and the consequently greater possibility of financial instability implied that it would be appropriate to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation at this juncture.",
        "The member saw that the prolonged sharp increase in household debt and rising housing prices had not only heightened the possibility of future financial instability, but also had been constantly increasing housing expenses.",
        "The member particularly raised the concern that a steep rise in housing expenses could work to decrease the real purchasing power of the national income and to undermine the quality of life.",
        "The member added that consideration should be given to the young generation’s stronger risk preference, and social costs such as delayed marriage and childbirth.",
        "The member expected that, if imputed rents were calculated and reflected in consumer prices, the uptrend in consumer prices would be even higher.",
        "In addition, the member pointed out that the sustained increase in leverage in the private sector would work to reduce medium- to long-term domestic economic dynamism, by weakening future consumption and investment capacities.",
        "The member voiced concern that the rapid rise in housing prices could cause a reduction in propensities to consume, by widening the wealth gap and future income disparities among households.",
        "The member noted that, since pursuing medium- to long-term financial stability and creating a foundation of stable economic growth were the main mandates of the central bank, careful attention should be given to the current sustained buildup in financial imbalances.",
        "The member judged that, since using macroprudential regulations alone to address this would have limitations, it would not be appropriate to delay the process of gradually adjusting the unusually accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that a Base Rate hike amid high uncertainties surrounding the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the duration of the spread of the virus could diminish the solid economic recovery which had been continuing since the first half of this year and increase the interest payment burdens of vulnerable households and corporations.",
        "Given these points, the member noted that it could be desirable to continue to monitor the spread of the coronavirus and trend of economic recovery a bit longer and choose to hike the Base Rate when uncertainties were reduced.",
        "However, the member noted that the general public had become much less worried about and sensitive to the spread of the virus, exports and domestic investment had maintained strong growth, and fiscal expansion from a supplementary budget was expected.",
        "The member thus saw that the short-term costs of a Base Rate hike might not be high enough to impair the future growth path.",
        "The member added that, even with a slight Base Rate hike, monetary policy would still be judged to remain very accommodative.",
        "The member argued that the continuation of the unprecedentedly low interest rate level adopted to prevent a financial market crunch and sudden contraction in economic activity in the face of the coronavirus emergency could have more negative impacts than positive impacts.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that, from the perspectives of normalizing interest rate levels and ensuring space for future monetary policy, it would be appropriate not to delay incremental and gradual Base Rate hikes, while carefully observing and analyzing their financial impacts and the trend of economic recovery, even if they were expected to incur small short-term costs.",
        "The member judged that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from 0.50%.",
        "The member also emphasized the need for sustaining and expanding the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility as well as providing fiscal support for small and medium-sized enterprises and small business owners hit by the prolonged coronavirus pandemic.",
        "One member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "On the domestic economic front, the member assessed that the recovery in domestic demand had been delayed longer than expectations in the first half of this year, due to the spread of virus variants.",
        "The member saw that, even if the domestic economy grew by 4% as projected by the Research Department, bolstered mainly by exports and manufacturing production, this year’s GDP would be merely 3% above that of 2019, before the outbreak of COVID-19, and private consumption would be more than 2% below that of 2019.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the manufacturing sector was expected to see high growth thanks to strong exports, the trend of structural decline in manufacturing employment had not reversed.",
        "The member saw that, although the unemployment rate had fallen, the broader unemployment rate encompassing long-term discouraged workers and persons on temporary leave was still higher than the pre-pandemic level.",
        "The member thus raised the concern that it would take more time for employment to recover.",
        "The member noted that, even if consumer price inflation for this year rose to around 2%, as projected by the Research Department, consumer price inflation for 2019 and 2020 was only 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, and core inflation would remain at the pressures was not a matter of concern, and inflation expectations implied in long-term interest rates were not high.",
        "The member stressed that, given that the spread of COVID-19 and strengthened social distancing measures were shocks with asymmetric effects on service industries rather than manufacturing, it would be important to observe business conditions in service industries and the trend of recovery in employment, compared to aggregate indicators such as GDP or the GDP gap.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that authorities should take full advantage of the fact that the Korean economy, with favorable external soundness, had fiscal and monetary policy space to support a full recovery of economic activity.",
        "The member expressed concern about the current housing price growth, but was pessimistic about containing volatility in housing prices by fine-tuning the Base Rate.",
        "The member noted that monetary policy had historically proven effective in achieving its natural objectives of economic and price stability, but it had not yet proven effective in stabilizing the housing market.",
        "The member added that, since it was not easy to take preemptive measures to stabilize the housing market in particular, and the housing cycle and the real economic cycle did not coincide with each other, using monetary policy to stabilize the housing market could conflict with the goal of pursuing stability in economic activity and prices.",
        "With respect to the claim made from various circles that the Base Rate should be raised to rein in the rapid household debt growth seen since the COVID-19 outbreak, the member noted that the trend of increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio since Rate.",
        "The member noted that a Base Rate hike could temporarily restrain the increase in household debt, but it would not provide a fundamental solution.",
        "The member saw a need for structural changes in household lending practices by financial institutions and in household lending regulations.",
        "The member stressed that before making a major change to the path of monetary policy it must be examined whether the economic situation simultaneously meets criteria in terms of economic activity, prices, employment and financial stability.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that, while keeping the Base Rate at the current level, it would be necessary to carefully monitor the spread of virus variants, the pace and effects of vaccination, changes in social distancing measures, and patterns of improvement in domestic demand and employment.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Joo, Sangyong expressed clear opposition to raising the Base Rate by Monetary Policy Decision - The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.50% to 0.75%.",
        "- Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have declined affected by the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The US dollar has strengthened and stock prices in emerging economies have fallen, due mainly to the possibility that the US Federal Reserve would start tapering its asset purchases within the year.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by monetary policy changes in major countries and their effects.",
        "- The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery.",
        "Although private consumption has somewhat slowed due to the coronavirus resurgence, exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has shown a robust trend.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery as private consumption is forecast to improve gradually, affected by the expansion of vaccinations and the execution of a supplementary budget, while exports and investment are expected to sustain their buoyancy.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in May.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has remained high at the mid-2% level due to the rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at the lower-1% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to the mid-2% level.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation will increase to the lower-2% level this year, exceeding the May forecast of 1.8%.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to run at the lower-1% level.",
        "- In domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements and the domestic resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The Korean Treasury bond yield, in particular the long-term bond yield, has declined.",
        "Household loan growth has accelerated and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "The Board will gradually adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above 2% for some time, despite ongoing uncertainties over the virus.",
        "In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: All members expected the domestic economy to run above the path previously projected and show a trend of expanded recovery.",
        "Looking at specific sectors, members expected exports and facilities investment to maintain their trends of improvement and the sluggishness in private consumption to ease gradually.",
        "However, members assessed that uncertainties related to COVID-19 remained high and expected the pace of economic recovery to be heavily dependent on the vaccine rollout schedule and the consequent trend of recovery in face-to-face industries.",
        "Members noted that sluggishness in employment conditions was easing gradually, with the year-on-year change in the number of persons employed turning positive in March.",
        "Members, however, pointed out that a closer look at the details of employment showed that the degree of improvement in overall employment conditions remained insufficient.",
        "Members saw that the upward trend of inflation had accelerated due to supply factors and could accelerate further in the short term.",
        "In this regard, some members gave attention to the pickup in the inflation expectations of the general public to the lower-2% level and presented the opinion that a close eye should be kept on the future inflation trend.",
        "Other members’ assessment was that, despite the increase in the price level felt by the general public, present conditions did not give rise to concerns about inflation, in contrast with the situation in the US.",
        "Members, meanwhile, judged that with accommodative financial conditions having been ongoing, financial stability risks had grown, as seen in a sustained increase in leverage in the private sector including household lending.",
        "Accordingly, some members called for increased vigilance with respect to financial stability conditions going forward.",
        "Members also noted that household and corporate lending rates had been moving in somewhat different directions of late, requiring continuous monitoring and analysis in terms of the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Members also emphasized the need to closely analyze major pending issues, such as the possibility of intensified US-China disputes, medium- to long-term Treasury bond supply and demand conditions, and financial conditions in the corporate sector.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economic recovery had been expanding of late, with the private consumption slump easing and the solid recoveries in exports and facilities investment continuing, led by the IT sector.",
        "The member saw that, going forward, the domestic economy would recover faster than the February projection, thanks to expanded growth in exports and investment, and gradual improvement in private consumption.",
        "The member, however, judged that uncertainties surrounding the pace of economic recovery in line with COVID-19 developments and vaccine supply remained high.",
        "The member pointed out that it was difficult to forecast the timing of normalization of domestic economic activity, due to disruptions in the global supply of vaccines and recent increases in new confirmed cases at home and abroad.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that labor market conditions were partially improving, with the number of persons employed shifting to an increase in March, but had not reached pre-pandemic levels.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the mid-1% level in March, influenced for instance by international oil prices and prices of agricultural, livestock and marine products.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to fluctuate at around the 2% level for some time, as upward pressures on the supply side would continue.",
        "The member also commented that the inflation expectations of the general public had risen to the lower-2% level, and presented the opinion that a close watch should be kept on the future movements of inflation expectations and their impacts on the actual price trend.",
        "Concerning the financial market, the member assessed that preference for risk assets was continuing in line with improvements in domestic and overseas economic indicators.",
        "The member noted that market interest rates, and long-term ones in particular, had remained on a continuous rise overall, and stock prices had rebounded on improved investment sentiment after mid-March.",
        "The member added that the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had risen significantly and then had fallen back, influenced by global movements of the US dollar.",
        "The member assessed recent financial market movements to reflect growing expectations for economic recovery.",
        "The member judged that overall financial conditions were maintaining an accommodative level that supported real economic recovery, as rises in short-term market interest rates and lending rates had been limited, although long-term interest rates continued to increase.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that such accommodative conditions and ongoing preferences for risk assets had been working to increase the risk of financial imbalances, through for instance the buildup of household debt and a continual rise in asset prices.",
        "The member also presented the view that it should be noted that the international financial market was showing much greater sensitivity to inflation and to changes in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member presented the opinion that the accommodative stance should be maintained for some time, in consideration of the still-high uncertainties related to COVID-19 developments, although the domestic economic recovery had been expanding of late.",
        "The member went on to argue that, in this process, a close watch should be kept on changes in financial stability risks.",
        "The member thus judged that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at the current level.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 0.50%.",
        "Looking at global economic developments since the February MPB meeting, the member assessed that the global economy was showing a trend of recovery, led by the US and China, but the pace of recovery differed from country to country, depending on the progress of COVID-19 vaccination.",
        "The member saw that, on the domestic economic front, major improvements in exports and facilities investment had been sustained and were likely to continue going forward, despite destabilizing factors such as possible intensification of US-China disputes.",
        "The member assessed that sluggishness in private consumption was easing gradually, and projected that a full-scale recovery would be heavily dependent on pandemic developments and vaccine distribution going forward.",
        "The member pointed out that, in the labor market, the number of persons employed had shifted to an increase, thanks for instance to a base effect, but employment felt by the general public was in a situation that could not be easily improved, due to sluggishness in services in the private sector.",
        "The member called for close monitoring to see whether trends of improvement in employment would continue or not, considering the greater difficulties for small businesses since the outbreak of the pandemic and changes in production and consumption patterns including the spread of work from home and increased online shopping.",
        "Meanwhile, on the inflation side, the member noted that consumer price inflation was likely to reach the 2% level in the second quarter, due mainly to rises in agricultural, livestock, and marine product prices and international oil prices, but would not reach the inflation target of 2% on an annual basis.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, while the IMF and other major organizations had made upward revisions to their growth outlooks for the domestic economy, upward risks to growth and inflation had increased since the February projection.",
        "The member, however, judged that monetary policy should remain accommodative, as uncertainties related to the resurgence of the pandemic and vaccine supply were sustained, and consumer price inflation was likely to run below the target on an annual basis.",
        "Meanwhile, the member commented that, although the international financial market had been stable overall, attention should be paid to the possibility of increased financial unrest in emerging market economies in line with rises in long-term market interest rates in the US.",
        "The member noted that long-term interest rates had risen in the domestic financial market as well, and assessed that this trend was in a way a natural consequence of expectations for recovery in economic activity and prices, just as had been seen in the US.",
        "The member estimated financial conditions to be considerably accommodative, and also emphasized the need to consider the point that the rises in financing rates for households and corporations were lower than the rises in long-term market interest rates.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed concerns about financial imbalances to have increased, with household lending in the financial sector in the first quarter increasing sharply, despite the government’s strong regulations.",
        "Accordingly, the member stated that there was a growing need to consider financial stability issues at the monetary policy level.",
        "Taking all this into comprehensive consideration, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% and continue monitoring real economic developments, the coronavirus vaccine rollout situation, and household debt and asset market trends.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that exports and investment were showing faster-than-expected recovery on noticeable improvements in economic conditions in major countries, influenced for instance by rapid vaccinations.",
        "The member, however, added that recovery in private consumption had been limited due to the continued spread of the pandemic and uncertainties related to vaccines.",
        "The member pointed out that, despite a shift to an increase in the number of persons employed in March, the details of employment conditions remained weak, as the contribution of growth in temporary workers was high, for instance.",
        "Looking at inflation, the member saw that consumer price inflation excluding administered prices had risen to the 2% level in March, but core inflation was likely to run at the lower- to mid-1% level for some time, even when the decline stemming from administered prices was accounted for.",
        "Taking all these into consideration, the member presented the opinion that the Base Rate should be kept at its current level to support the domestic economic recovery, since private consumption, employment, and prices remained sluggish, despite significant improvement in external conditions.",
        "The member, however, raised concerns about the buildup of financial stability risks, as household lending was sustaining high growth of around 10 trillion won a month due to increased lending in the non-banking sector, and lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises also continued to rise sharply.",
        "The member stated that such loans appeared to be sound, with their delinquency rates remaining low, but pointed out that the actual credit risks were estimated to be higher in consideration of the growing debt burden stemming from the sluggishness in economic activity and employment, and the weakening financial strength of small- and medium enterprises.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that the relevant risk factors should be continually monitored, and macroprudential policy encompassing the non-banking sector should be implemented without delay.",
        "The member added that special attention should be paid to the recent increase in the interest repayment burden of households and corporations as financing rates rose due to higher market interest rates and the greater share of lending in the non-banking sector.",
        "The member assessed that, with respect to expectations of economic conditions for conducting monetary policy going forward, the upside risks were greater than the downside risks: exports and investment continued to show improvement, bolstered by improved external conditions, and domestic demand and employment were continually recovering, albeit moderately.",
        "However, the member stated that it was too early to discuss monetary policy normalization, given the still-high uncertainties related to domestic COVID-19 developments and vaccination, and continued difficulties in damaged sectors.",
        "The member, however, added that, since the economy was becoming more vulnerable to rising interest rates in the future due to the buildup of private debt, it was important for economic agents to pay attention to and prepare for such a situation.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that the global economy was showing a stronger-than-expected recovery, boosted by massive fiscal stimulus in major countries and the expansion of vaccinations.",
        "The member added that the domestic economy was also exhibiting a stronger recovery, as export growth was accelerating and facilities investment continued to recover, bolstered by the global economic recovery and the buoyant semiconductor industry, and as the sluggishness of consumption and employment was easing.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation would reach around 2% in the second quarter, driven by a base-period effect on top of the widening scale of increase in petroleum and agricultural product prices, and inflation expectations among the general public were growing slightly of late.",
        "Financial market conditions, meanwhile, had remained accommodative for a considerable period of time, with household lending sustaining substantial growth, and the domestic FX market continued its stable trend.",
        "The member projected that the domestic economy would sustain a recovery, boosted by exports and investment, and that the growth rate for this year would be above the February forecast.",
        "The member, however, assessed that uncertainty surrounding the future recovery path remained high, as the worsening resurgence of COVID-19 and uncertainties related to vaccine distribution could have a considerable impact on consumption and employment.",
        "Taking these overall conditions into consideration, the member assessed that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "The member expressed the view that, while maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance to support a full-fledged recovery, careful attention should continue to be paid to the accumulation of factors likely to undermine financial stability in the future due to the sustained monetary easing.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to consider conducting monetary policy with a greater focus on financial stability once the spread of COVID-19 eases and the domestic economy shows a marked recovery.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy was exhibiting robust growth boosted by exports and facilities investment, and expected that production and exports of not just the IT industry but also non-IT industries would contribute noticeably to growth this year.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that although the spread of COVID-19 was not easing and vaccinations were proceeding more slowly than expected, the consumer sentiment index had improved significantly and various consumption indicators were actually emerging rapidly from their sluggishness at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year.",
        "The member added that labor market conditions overall had started to show a recovery.",
        "The member noted that the 10-year Korean Treasury bond yield had recently shown a larger extent of increase, in strong synchronization with US long-term rates, raising concerns that there might be inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.",
        "The member, however, took the view that domestic long-term rate fluctuations are analyzed as being affected more by US long-term rates and Korean Treasury bond supply and demand conditions than by inflation, and that in this regard it would be excessive to interpret the uptrend in long-term interest rates as signaling inflationary pressures at a similar level to those of the US.",
        "The member mentioned that both the Bank of Korea and the IMF had forecast consumer price inflation to remain in the low- to mid-1% range and the GDP deflator growth rate to be even lower this year.",
        "The member argued that the domestic economy was undoubtedly sustaining its recovery, but since the recovery was still at the early stages and employment, wages and inflation were moving slowly, it was still too early to talk about normalizing monetary policy out of concerns about inflation.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although the Base Rate had declined to an unprecedentedly low level due to the accommodative monetary policy over the past year, real interest rates had not fallen as much as nominal ones had when the low inflation trend was counted in, and it was also difficult to say that current rate was lower than the neutral one although there is some uncertainty in estimating the neutral rate.",
        "The member noted that, since inflation had fallen substantially below the Bank of Korea’s target level, taking monetary policy in a more firmly accommodative direction would help speed up economic recovery.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that, since this could lead to an excessive prolongation of the gap between the real economy and real estate prices, it would be necessary to focus on stabilizing funding rates for the government and enterprises, rather than to make additional rate cuts.",
        "More specifically, the member emphasized that it would be necessary to maintain and expand support measures for SMEs, such as the bank intermediated lending support facility, until the economy shows an even stronger recovery, while purchasing an appropriate amount of Korean Treasury bonds to control upward pressures on long-term interest rates.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "First, looking at the global economy, the member assessed that the economic recovery was back on track, driven by expanded vaccine distribution and major countries’ implementation of stimulus packages.",
        "More specifically, the member forecast that the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of the global economy would rebound again in the second quarter, as corporate investment in major countries and goods exports by Asian countries continued to grow robustly and major survey results improved greatly.",
        "The member, however, judged that uncertainty surrounding the medium- and long-term recovery path remained high, since it was still unclear how the spread of COVID-19 would play out and the gap in economic activity between countries had widened significantly.",
        "The member assessed the domestic economy as maintaining more favorable growth than originally forecast, with manufacturing production and exports increasing sharply.",
        "The member added that the gap in economic activity between industries and sectors had been easing somewhat.",
        "The member, however, mentioned that demand in face-to-face industries remained extremely sluggish, and the business climate for related industries was unlikely to improve any time soon considering the pace of the recent spread of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution in Korea.",
        "The member argued that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility that prolonged sluggishness in face-to-face industries would worsen employment conditions for vulnerable groups, preventing the economy from entering a full-fledged recovery phase and consequently having a negative impact on growth potential.",
        "In terms of inflation, although consumer price inflation had accelerated month-on-month in March, the member projected that this trend would not continue after the second half of this year, considering the recent trends of international oil and grain prices and the influence of base-period effects.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that, since price rises caused by supply-side factors had continued longer than usual and inflation expectations at home and abroad were likely to increase somewhat while economic activities were getting back to normal, the possibility could not be ruled out of upward pressures on underlying inflation increasing to a greater extent than expected.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that financial conditions had become even more accommodative in the meantime.",
        "The member pointed out that a sharp rise in long-term market interest rates had only limited impacts on short-term benchmarks and lending rates in the banking sector and that prices of risk assets continued to rise.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that leverage in the private sector continued to increase, with household lending sustaining strong growth led by accommodative financial conditions, and went on to argue that attention should be paid to the possibility that this could heighten medium- and long-term financial vulnerability and negatively affect the efficiency of resource allocation.",
        "Taking all these into consideration, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% to help the domestic economy become established in a broader recovery phase.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that, amid the continued accommodative financial conditions, expectations of domestic and overseas economic recovery and inflation had been growing, which could act to expand leverage in the private sector and increase the risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances, and added that heightened vigilance would be needed in this regard.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economy has remained slow due to the ongoing influence of the movement restrictions following the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "In global financial markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased, mainly driven by the expectations for economic recovery following the expansion of vaccinations and the prospect of a further fiscal stimulus package by the new US administration.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "consumption has remained weak as social distancing has been prolonged, exports have sustained their buoyancy led by the IT sector and facilities investment has continued to recover.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, as the number of persons employed declined sharply compared to the corresponding period last year.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery, led by exports and investment.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated.",
        "GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the November forecast.",
        "prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products were offset by factors such as the decreasing prices of public services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the mid-0% level.",
        "The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to mid-1% level this year, exceeding the November forecast of 1.0%, largely reflecting the increase in global oil prices and gradual improvement in economic activity.",
        "Core inflation is forecast to run at around 1%.",
        "won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements.",
        "Stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by both expectations for economic recovery and caution about the recent rally.",
        "Household loan growth has accelerated, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.",
        "economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth."

    "2020": [
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ Members’ evaluation was that the global economy had been going through a serious slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, global trade had contracted and oil prices had remained low.",
        "Members assessed that risk-off sentiment had moderated considerably in the global financial markets, thanks to aggressive policy measures by countries around the world and expectations of economic reopening, but uncertainties remained high concerning the future path and impacts of the pandemic.",
        "Members expected that the domestic economy would not be hit as hard by COVID-19 as economies of major advanced countries, but the economy was extremely sluggish, recording negative growth in both the first and second quarters, and was likely to exhibit negative growth in annual terms as well.",
        "By sector, members judged that private consumption had remained sluggish and the recovery in facilities investment had been subdued.",
        "Members expressed concerns that, on top of the slowdown of domestic demand, the sluggishness of exports that had become apparent since the second quarter might limit domestic economic growth.",
        "With regard to prices, members pointed out that the slump in aggregate demand, in combination with the drop in global oil prices, had dragged consumer price inflation down to the 0% level, and core inflation had also fallen significantly.",
        "Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members’ evaluation was that the volatility of price variables had eased and credit flows had improved, as global financial market conditions had stabilized and the Bank of Korea and the Korean government had taken decisive policy measures.",
        "Members stressed, however, that attention should be paid to the possibility of renewed financial market unrest due to the high uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and also to the widening disparity between the recovery of financial markets and the sluggishness of the real economy.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%.",
        "The member mentioned that the global economy had been facing a serious slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Looking at individual countries, the member’s assessment was that the Chinese economy had been recovering from the shock of the previous quarter and showing gradual improvement, while economic activities in the US and the euro area had contracted drastically since March.",
        "The member noted that, in an effort to cushion economic shocks, most countries had been adopting accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and major countries had been recently easing lockdown measures gradually, resulting in partial economic reopening.",
        "The member added that all this had been supporting expectations of economic improvement in the second half.",
        "The member’s diagnosis, however, was that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high, owing to the uncertainty of pandemic-related developments and to the signs of a reescalation of US-China trade tensions.",
        "Regarding the domestic economy, the member forecast that, although the COVID-19 shock seemed less severe in Korea than in major advanced countries, domestic GDP was projected to contract this quarter, representing two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth for the first time since 2003.",
        "The member forecast that, however, a somewhat different picture could be in sight from the previous quarter in that exports would decline at a much faster pace, particularly to the US and the euro area where preventive measures had been strengthened, while the decline in private consumption would ease gradually, boosted by various policy support measures.",
        "However, the member mentioned that caution was required in concluding whether the recent consumption trend could lead to sustainable improvement, since consumer sentiment had contracted substantially, and employment and income conditions were highly likely to worsen further for some time.",
        "With regard to financial markets, meanwhile, the member evaluated that risk-off sentiment had been easing, mostly because of aggressive policy responses by individual countries and expectations of economic reopening.",
        "The member assessed that credit risk aversion had not increased further in capital markets, and that ample liquidity had ensured favorable credit supply in indirect financial markets, which accounted for a large share of the funding of Korean businesses.",
        "In this regard, the member judged that the possibility of a real-financial vicious circle, in which financial market unrest adds to the real economic shock, had been prevented to some extent.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that, since the fundamental cause of the current real economic contraction lay in the pandemic, not in financial issues, it was difficult to consider improvement in financial conditions as a sufficient condition for economic recovery.",
        "The member emphasized that attention should be paid to the possibility that price variable volatility would rise again and household and corporate credit risks would increase in the event of a delay in economic recovery due to prolongation of the pandemic.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member’s projection was that, although financial market unrest caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had been easing substantially, the negative spillover effects on the domestic real economy were expected to last for some time due to the worsening overseas economic conditions.",
        "The member also stressed that the possibility of downside risks to the medium- and long-term growth path could not be ruled out, amid uncertainties regarding when the pandemic, the root cause of the shock, would significantly subside.",
        "In light of this, the member argued that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 0.50% this time to provide a buffer against downside risks to the domestic economy.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 0.75% to 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures taken in response by countries around the world had put the global economy into a recession unprecedented since the Great Depression.",
        "The member stated that Korea had not imposed a large-scale lockdown thanks to its effective preventive measures and was accordingly facing less severe growth loss than major advanced countries.",
        "The member, however, added that it still needed to be kept in mind that the ongoing crisis had come amid a falling potential growth rate and a sustained low inflation trend.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, looking at its economic impact, the pandemic was unusual since it affected both supply and demand, but as the domestic economy had been able to avoid an extreme lockdown and shutdowns of production facilities, the shock had been more of a demand nature.",
        "The member mentioned that households’ average propensity to consume had declined significantly in the first quarter, and that consumer price inflation and core inflation had run at only 0.1% in April.",
        "In addition, regional economic activities in March and April, when the dramatic negative impacts had peaked, clearly showed a correlation among consumption, employment and inflation in which a drop in one factor leads to a fall in the others.",
        "The member anticipated that, although the government’s accommodative fiscal policy was expected to offset the sluggishness of demand to a certain extent, the negative output gap would inevitably widen.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, although the Base Rate had been lowered from 1.25% to 0.75% at the interim meeting in March, a further rate cut was inevitable, given the forecasts of the negative output gap exceeding 2%p and low inflation nearing 0%.",
        "For this year in particular, the member forecast that the private sector would exhibit a negative growth rate even though the government sector would not.",
        "The member took the view that the current crisis triggered by COVID-19 had been weighing on both the household and corporate sectors and that the worsening of private sector balance sheets might create a cycle of contraction in the overall economy in which a decrease in one sector leads to a decline in another.",
        "Regarding government measures such as government bond issuance and expansionary fiscal policy, the member went on to argue that it would be necessary to take measures to reduce overall financial expenses including debt-servicing burdens.",
        "The member stressed the need for the central bank to seek market interest rate stability by lowering the Base Rate and buying Treasury bonds, as the central bank needed to play a leading role in overcoming the crisis.",
        "The member in this regard expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to lower the Base Rate from the current 0.75% to 0.50% this time in order to induce a reduction of financial expenses in the private and government sectors, while coping with downward pressures on nominal demand.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the 0.50% Base Rate would be the lowest in the history of the domestic economy, it would not be low enough given the unprecedented current environment in which nominal GDP was almost 0%, nor would it be so low as to trigger sudden capital flows, considering the gap between domestic interest rates and those of major advanced countries.",
        "Finally, the member argued that the monetary easing stance should be maintained for a considerable period of time in order to induce an appropriate level of inflation expectations under the inflation targeting regime.",
        "The member judged that there were some concerns about the possibility of a Base Rate cut increasing instability in real estate and other financial sectors, but this should not be a top priority consideration for the monetary authorities in the current crisis.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that housing supply policies, tax policies and macroprudential policies should be carried out as planned in order to stabilize the housing market.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward from the current 0.75% to 0.50% this time.",
        "Looking at economic developments since the April MPB meeting, the member assessed that major countries, including the US and European countries, had exhibited much slower growth due to COVID-19, and as a result, world trade had contracted and oil prices had remained low.",
        "The member noted that these global economic conditions had been having negative impacts on the domestic real economy as well.",
        "The member forecast that private consumption, although having shown some signs of recovery since the second quarter, would exhibit negative growth in annual terms, and facilities investment would be more sluggish than originally projected due to a correction in non-IT investment.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the export slump that had persisted since the second quarter, along with the slowdown of domestic demand, might work to restrict growth of the domestic economy this year.",
        "Turning to employment conditions, the member noted that deterioration had thus far been seen mostly in the services sector, but predicted that an employment downturn would also become evident in the manufacturing and construction sectors as well.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member pointed out that consumer price inflation had fallen close to 0% and core inflation had also declined significantly.",
        "The member evaluated that, in consideration of this situation, the Research Department had made drastic downward adjustments to its growth and consumer price inflation forecasts for this year, but downside risks related to these forecasts might materialize, since the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 could not be ruled out and the global economy could remain sluggish.",
        "The member expressed the view that the negative output gap was currently widening, as was the negative inflation gap due to low demand-side inflation pressures, and in light of this, it would be necessary to strengthen the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Meanwhile, the member judged that uncertainties in the international financial markets had decreased somewhat and the financial and FX markets in Korea had become relatively stable thanks to the effectiveness of aggressive measures adopted by the Korean government and the Bank of Korea.",
        "The member stressed the need to continue to closely monitor financial market developments at home and abroad and seek additional responses promptly if needed.",
        "The member mentioned that the current pandemic had occurred at a time when concerns had been raised about the possibility that a surge in liquidity from sustained accommodative macroeconomic policies in Korea and major countries might act as a factor for financial market unrest.",
        "The member took the view that, although it had been pointed out for some time that the issues of excessive liquidity and debt should be considered in monetary policy decisions, in times of crisis like this priority should be placed on making policy judgments to cope with the crisis.",
        "The member added that it was time to put the debt issue aside for the moment and take bold macroeconomic measures to combat the ongoing crisis.",
        "The member judged that, although the Base Rate had been already lowered to the still had room for a further rate cut considering the level of the policy rates of major countries.",
        "The member in this regard argued that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 0.75% to 0.50%.",
        "The member expected that the current rate cut would help ease the burdens on households, small business owners and corporations troubled by the pandemic and also help the government implement fiscal policy in pursuit of economic recovery.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward by 25 basis points.",
        "The member diagnosed the global economy as suffering huge difficulties, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 were widely seen across the board in both advanced and emerging economies and in both domestic demand and exports.",
        "The member added that there were high uncertainties as to how the COVID-19 situation would develop and how severe its impacts would be.",
        "The member noted that the Research Department was projecting growth for this year to stand at -0.2%, 2.3 percentage points lower than the previous forecast, even with the basic assumptions that the global spread of COVID-19 would peak in the second quarter and there would not be a major second wave in Korea.",
        "The member pointed out that, although this figure was much more favorable than the forecasts for major economies or the global average, it would represent the first negative growth of the domestic economy since the Asian Currency Crisis, and would consequently make the negative output gap widen further and last longer.",
        "The member raised the concern that, if there were a second wave of COVID-19, contrary to the basic assumption, or if downside risks such as an escalation of the US-China trade conflict and the spread of economic crises in EMEs materialized, the additional negative impacts on the domestic economy could be enormous.",
        "The member also saw that, with respect to prices, consumer price inflation would slow to the 0% level and fall further short of the inflation target due to sluggishness in aggregate demand compounded by the decline in international oil prices.",
        "The member noted that, in response to this sluggish growth and inflation and to the financial unrest immediately following the spread of COVID-19, the MPB had cut the Base Rate by 50 basis points in March and had supplied liquidity on a large scale by for instance expanding the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility and taking various open market operation measures.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, as a result, financial stability was able to be achieved, with price variables showing less volatility and credit flows improving.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that, on the other hand, there had been concern about whether there was excessive decoupling between sluggishness in the real economy and improvement in the financial markets.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, if the improvement in the financial markets did not lead to improvement in the real economy, the financial markets could undergo a considerable correction.",
        "The member added that, in the medium to long term, active monetary accommodation could cause a deepening of financial imbalances through economic agents’ stronger search for yield, concentration of liquidity into certain asset markets coupled with rising asset prices, and increased debt servicing burdens and default risk stemming from accumulated debt.",
        "The member noted that, considering the above-mentioned matters, macroeconomic risk and financial stability risk had conflicting implications for monetary policy decision-making.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 0.75% to 0.50% this time, since it appeared to be more urgent to stimulate growth and inflation than to control the deepening of financial imbalances.",
        "The member added that, if the Base Rate were lowered at this meeting, there would be only limited scope for further downward adjustments to the Base Rate, not only in terms of financial imbalances, but also in terms of policy effectiveness and possible capital outflows, although this judgment could of course vary depending upon changes in domestic and international financial conditions and the monetary policy operations of major economies.",
        "One member stated that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward by The member’s assessment was that COVID-19 was simultaneously causing negative demand-side and supply-side shocks to the domestic economy, thereby weighing on economic activity and putting downward pressure on prices.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, in response, accommodative monetary policy should be conducted while taking into account interactions with fiscal policy.",
        "The member noted that the Research Department was forecasting growth for this year to record a low level of -0.2% under a baseline scenario in which the number of confirmed coronavirus cases would peak in the second quarter.",
        "The member pointed out that Korea could be said to have been less severely impacted by COVID-19 than major countries in that it had opted for a quarantine, not a lockdown.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the negative growth was almost unprecedented and the quality of growth was also very fragile.",
        "Specifically, the member expected private consumption to decrease substantially, with the effects of large-scale transfer payments by the government excluded, and facilities investment and exports to be very sluggish with the exception of semiconductors.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the sluggishness in the private sector was due to the amplification of the coronavirus shock through interactions with structural vulnerabilities in the domestic economy.",
        "The member thus noted that it was necessary to prevent, as much as possible, the coronavirus shock from leading to permanent damage to the foundation for growth.",
        "The member went on to present the opinion that, to this end, it was necessary to reduce the financial costs of the private sector and the fiscal burden of the government through an additional Base Rate cut.",
        "The member commented that, with respect to inflation, active response measures were needed, particularly since both consumer price inflation and core inflation remained in the lower-0% range, even raising concerns about deflation.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the Phillips curve had flattened, the recent very large slowdowns in economic activity and employment were having negative impacts on inflation and income levels.",
        "The member thus emphasized the importance of preventing a decline in inflation expectations through active policy responses and communications.",
        "Meanwhile, the member acknowledged that concerns about financial imbalances and capital outflows had increased as the Base Rate approached the effective lower bound.",
        "The member, however, commented that household debt was showing modest growth, while foreign portfolio investment was recording net inflows unlike periods of international financial unrest in the past thanks to the robust external soundness of the domestic economy.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was necessary to closely watch the relevant developments in the future.",
        "Finally, the member commented that interest rate policy should be conducted flexibly by closely monitoring the possibility of domestic and international economic sluggishness becoming deeper than expected due to a second wave of COVID-19 or the possibility of the economy shifting to a recovery trend thanks to the spread of COVID-19 easing earlier than expected.",
        "The member also emphasized the need to continue to give thought to various monetary policy tools.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members participating in the vote supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.50%.",
        "significantly due to constrained economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Unease in global financial markets has moderated considerably.",
        "Stock prices in major countries have risen, and the volatility of government bond yields and exchange rates has lessened thanks to aggressive fiscal and monetary measures in major economies and expectations of economic reopening.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses.",
        "sluggish, and exports have fallen significantly.",
        "While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the correction in construction investment has continued.",
        "Labor market conditions have worsened with a sharp decline in the number of persons employed, especially in the service sector.",
        "The Board expects that domestic economic growth will remain sluggish for some time due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "GDP growth is projected to fall considerably below the February forecast of 2.1% to around 0%, and uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high.",
        "declining prices of petroleum products and public services as well as slower growth in the prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also moved down to the lower-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have fallen slightly to the mid-1% level.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the lower-0% and mid-0% level this year, respectively, due to the drop in global oil prices and weakening demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "global financial market conditions as well as decisive market stabilization measures.",
        "While long-term market interest rates have fallen, stock prices have risen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within a narrow range.",
        "The increase in household loans has slowed, and the rate of increase in housing prices has decelerated.",
        "- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, and changes in financial stability.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (November 2020),[2)]_ _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members expected the growth path of the domestic economy to slightly exceed the previous forecast.",
        "By sector, members forecast that private consumption, and face-to-face services in particular, would continue to recover at a slow pace, while exports would continue improvement thanks chiefly to recoveries of major economies and facilities investment would exhibit recovery centering around the IT sector.",
        "However, members evaluated that high upside and downside risks, such as the resurgence of COVID-19 and the timing of the rollout of vaccines, continued to surround the growth path of the domestic economy.",
        "Members forecast that employment sluggishness would ease gradually, but it would take a substantial period of time for employment to get back to its pre-crisis level.",
        "Members expressed particular concerns that the employment shock from COVID-19 had been relatively concentrated on vulnerable groups, including the low-income group, small business owners and young people.",
        "Concerning inflation, members expected that prices would rise at a somewhat faster pace, affected largely by improvements in economic activity and lower downward pressures on inflation from government policy.",
        "One member expressed the view that inflationary pressures might be larger than expected next year, considering the rapid recovery of personal services prices.",
        "Meanwhile, members’ evaluation was that domestic and international financial and foreign exchange markets generally remained stable.",
        "However, members pointed out that household debt growth was accelerating and risk appetite was strengthening amid the continued accommodative financial conditions, and went on to stress that continued attention should be paid to the possibility of an accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "The majority of members also presented the opinion that it would be necessary to pay attention to the possibility of sharp fluctuations in the USD/KRW exchange rate having substantial impacts on financial stability as well as on the real economy.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level.",
        "The member expected that, although the global economic recovery had been slowing somewhat with the accelerating spread of COVID-19, the global economy would sustain its modest recovery, as uncertainties related to the US presidential election had eased and the likelihood of early rollout of vaccines was increasing amid the accommodative policy stances of countries around the world.",
        "As for the domestic real economy, the member noted that the pace of the decline in exports had been slowing more rapidly than expected, boosted by the global economic recovery, and facilities investment had shown a relatively favorable recovery.",
        "The member saw that, although the construction sector had continued to go through a correction and the face-to-face services sector had experienced a delay in improvement, production and investment had been overall showing modest recoveries.",
        "The member added that private consumption had been exhibiting a slow recovery, as consumption of face-to-face services had remained extremely sluggish while goods consumption had continued to grow.",
        "Looking at employment, the member mentioned that the number of persons employed remained on a downward trend, since even industries with improving business conditions were rehiring workers on temporary leave and increasing working hours rather than hiring new workers.",
        "The member took the view that it would be necessary to closely monitor whether any changes were taking place in the employment structure of the domestic economy, given the sharp decline in the number of persons employed despite the overall recovery of production and investment.",
        "Meanwhile, the member forecast that inflation would remain in the low- to mid-0% range for some time and start to rise gradually next year.",
        "Concerning the financial markets, the member saw that accommodative financial conditions continued with both household and corporate lending showing faster growth recently and asset prices continuing to rise.",
        "The member emphasized that the gap between financial and real economic conditions seemed to be widening due to the necessary, sustained monetary policy accommodation at home and abroad to support real economic recovery, and in this regard, careful monitoring of the medium- and long-term effects was needed.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, after having improved slightly since October, face-to-face services industries might shrink again in line with the recent continuous growth in the number of domestic confirmed cases and the strengthening of social distancing measures.",
        "The member expected that it would take a considerable period of time for the deployment of vaccines to completely resolve public fears about virus infection.",
        "The member judged that, under these circumstances, it would be necessary to maintain accommodative monetary policy until the real economy exhibits a clearly marked recovery, and in this regard, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, despite the resurgence of COVID-19, the global economy had been sustaining a gradual recovery since the third quarter.",
        "The member assessed that import demand from advanced countries had been improving centering around imports of durables and the Chinese economy had also been favorable with exports and domestic demand increasing.",
        "The member stated that the Bank of Korea had adjusted its domestic economic growth forecast upward this time in reflection of the recent faster-than-expected improvement in exports, and presented the view that the favorable movements of Korea’s exports despite the unprecedented shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed the importance of Korea’s main manufacturing industries, including semiconductors and automobiles, as the axis of growth.",
        "However, the member pointed out that the gap between economic indicators and economic sentiment had been widening even further, as improvement in exports had been enjoyed only by some industries and domestic demand including consumption and construction had been sluggish.",
        "Concerning private consumption, the member noted that, despite the rise in household income in line with increased government transfer payments, the resurgence of COVID-19, combined with widening income imbalances and growing leasehold deposits and monthly rents, had been limiting recovery of private consumption.",
        "The member expressed concerns that those in their 20s and 30s had recently been actively purchasing houses through leverage, and considering their high marginal propensity to consume, this could permanently diminish the consumption base.",
        "The member also added that the sluggishness of SMEs, small business owners and the construction sector, all of which accounted for great job creation effect, would make it difficult for employment to show a clearly marked recovery for a considerable period of time.",
        "Meanwhile, the member forecast that inflation would remain low at the 0% level until the first half of next year, influenced by weak inflation pressures on both the supply and demand sides.",
        "Looking at recent trends in the financial sector, the member stated that financial conditions had been showing a far stronger recovery than the real economy, with stock prices rising and the USD/KRW exchange rate declining, supported by ample liquidity and expectations of an economic recovery, and went on to point out that vigilance against financial imbalances was growing accordingly.",
        "The member expressed concerns that, although housing price growth had slowed somewhat, expectations that they would rise further remained strong, leading to a sharp increase in household debt.",
        "The member added that the pace of increase in lending to SMEs had been accelerating again, suggesting a higher risk of potential defaults.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that, although the domestic economy had been showing recovery after having bottomed out in the second quarter, uncertainties at home and abroad remained high and the quality of economic growth was insufficient, and in this regard, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time and maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance for a considerable period of time.",
        "However, the member stressed that, against a buildup of financial imbalances, the Bank of Korea should work in cooperation with the government and the supervisory authorities to closely examine and actively deal with overall risk factors.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that Treasury and other bond issuance was highly likely to increase next year while demand from foreigners and domestic long-term investment institutions was expected to weaken, and that it would be necessary to review the idea of further increasing asset purchases in order to ease the volatility of long-term market interest rates.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at its current level.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the global economy had continued to show gradual improvement, with the manufacturing sector exhibiting stronger recovery.",
        "The member stated that there remained high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path due to the latest resurgence of COVID-19 particularly in major advanced countries, but the resulting contraction in economic activity was expected to be smaller than that seen in the first half of this year, since lessons learned from earlier in the pandemic had weakened the relationship between lockdown measures and economic activities while expectations of access to vaccines had been easing risk-off sentiment in the financial markets.",
        "The member evaluated the domestic economy as having sustained relatively favorable improvement boosted by exports and goods consumption.",
        "The member however mentioned that production activities in major industries had not fully returned to their pre-COVID-19 level and the third wave of the virus was expected to cause further economic losses.",
        "Most of all, the member expressed concerns that the repeated spread of COVID-19 and strengthening of measures to combat the pandemic had led to the accumulation of losses in face-to-face services industries accounting for great job creation effect, and as a result, employment sluggishness was likely to continue for an unusually long period of time and the consumption capacities of low-income households with relatively high marginal propensity to consume could shrink even further.",
        "The member added that, looking at the supply side, the business base of small business owners and micro businesses could be undermined, consequently weakening growth potential.",
        "In light of this, the member took the view that, while maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance to support real economic recovery and stabilize inflation expectations, it would be necessary to pay attention to some distinctive points that had been seen since the outbreak of COVID-19.",
        "First, the member noted that with economic losses from the pandemic concentrated in certain industries, the gap in economic conditions among sectors and income groups had been widening significantly, which could weaken the correlation among economic cycle of individual industries and limiting the virtuous circle with demand conditions, and in this regard, continued policy attention was needed on vulnerable sectors.",
        "Second, the member pointed out that, given the wide gap between asset prices and the real economy and high uncertainties related to the pandemic, it would be difficult to completely rule out the possibility of a rapid increase in financial market volatility and a consequent tightening of domestic financial conditions.",
        "The member added that it should be noted that the transmission of accommodative monetary policy could be limited if a crowding-out effect from increased Treasury bond issuance caused market interest rates to rise significantly or continued global dollar weakness accelerated the appreciation of the Korean won.",
        "Finally, the member’s assessment was that leveraging had been increasing consistently, which was in contrast with the substantial deleveraging seen in the private sector during previous economic crises.",
        "The member particularly pointed out that household debt had been growing at a much faster pace recently despite various micro-level regulations, and went on to stress that debt-servicing capacities of individual sectors should be closely monitored in order to prevent an excessive accumulation of debt burdens from making temporary liquidity problems develop into solvency risks or acting as a downside risk to the medium- and long-term growth path.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% while continually examining financial stability conditions and the need for selective support for vulnerable sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member assessed that, although the possibility of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment rollouts had been materializing, uncertainties surrounding the growth path still remained high due to the accelerated resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic at home and abroad.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the performance of exports led by semiconductors was more favorable and the decline in global goods trade had been slower than previously forecast, the contraction in private consumption had not been eased easily.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the domestic economy would achieve growth at around 3% next year, it would not be enough to cover the gap with potential GDP, given the degree to which production had contracted this year.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that there was no reason to preemptively change the current monetary policy stance for now.",
        "The member saw that inflation was continuing to show no more than a moderate rebound of late.",
        "The member noted that, as an example, looking at core inflation with administered items excluded to rule out policy factors such as the government’s telecom bill subsidy, the growth rate in October this year stood at 1.1% year on year, showing a sign of recovery from the lowest points in March and April, when the shocks from COVID-19 were the greatest.",
        "The member, however, explained that it was too early to assess that a rebound had fully begun.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, while employment had bottomed out, its pace of recovery was very moderate.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, if economic recovery materialized in the future, employment would consequently grow.",
        "The member, however, noted that attention should be paid to the following ongoing structural changes.",
        "The member commented that, most importantly, the fact that the working-age population (aged 15-64) was decreasing rapidly from this year could weigh on the recovery of growth and employment.",
        "The member also pointed out that structural changes were underway in industry-level employment.",
        "The member explained that, for example, although manufacturing production activity had already recovered to the pre-pandemic level, employment had not emerged from its decline, and the expanded non-face-to-face consumption structure could cause chronic sluggishness in employment.",
        "The member, meanwhile, raised the concern that the growth rate had been showing a secular decline so far, regardless of the pandemic, and the COVID-19 employment shock was heavily impacting vulnerable groups, thus worsening income distribution.",
        "The member saw that, although the COVID-19 pandemic would end eventually, its aftereffects were unlikely to be small.",
        "The member, thus, emphasized that the government policy measures to ensure a recovery in employment and improvement in distribution should be maintained for a considerable time.",
        "The member also added that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be kept unchanged in order to supplement and support an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be necessary to hold the Base Rate at its current level and to leave open the possibility of using selective tools to provide growth opportunities to vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member added that, if the trend of imbalanced growth and low inflation continued despite an economic rebound in the future, it would be necessary to rationally restructure and make active use of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic economy, and exports and facilities investment in particular, had been maintaining steady improvement of late.",
        "The member expected the domestic economy to continue a better-than-expected recovery in the future on improvement in the global economy.",
        "The member, however, assessed that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path were still high due to the rapid resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad of late.",
        "The member stated that, in the November economic outlook, the economic growth rates for this year and the next were revised slightly upward from the previous forecasts under a baseline scenario in which the domestic resurgence of COVID-19 would continue this winter.",
        "The member went on to argue that attention should be paid to extremely high uncertainties as to how serious the resurgence would be and how long it would last, and when COVID-19 vaccines and treatments would roll out.",
        "The member saw that, looking at inflation, consumer price inflation was forecast to remain in the mid-0% range, similar to that seen last year, on weaker demand-side upward pressures, and impacts of low oil prices and government policy measures.",
        "The member, however, forecast that consumer price inflation would rise to the 1% range next year, as downward inflationary pressures from the government policy measures would decrease and the economy would improve.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic financial markets remained stable overall, influenced by the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member noted that stock prices had risen sharply and market interest rates had also increased, on improved investment sentiment in the financial markets stemming from stronger expectations for economic recovery following improvements in major economic indicators, from the easing of uncertainties related to the US presidential election, and from expectations for early development of vaccines.",
        "The member added that, while deposit and lending rates at financial institutions remained stable, financial institutions’ supply of credit to corporations also remained active, as seen in a slight increase in M2 growth.",
        "The member also noted that the FX market was also gradually regaining stability as the US dollar became less volatile.",
        "The member presented the opinion that these latest financial conditions appeared to make up for the shortfall of demand stemming from COVID-19, thus supporting recovery in the domestic economy.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that, particularly since housing price growth and the resulting household lending growth had accelerated of late, if financial conditions further ease, negative impacts on financial stability should be closely watched for.",
        "The member noted that, in conclusion, although the domestic economy was showing recovery, the accommodative financial conditions should be continued in an effort to offset the ongoing negative impacts of COVID-19.",
        "The member also saw that it would be necessary to symmetrically consider both uncertainties inherent in the future growth path and potential factors causing financial instability.",
        "The member thus presented the view that it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%, and to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance until the economy is projected to maintain a stable recovery.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member saw that, although the world economy had shown modest improvement since the October meeting, led by the US and China, the degree of such improvement could be limited until early next year due to the latest resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries.",
        "The member was concerned that, although the domestic real economy had shown a better-than-expected performance, thanks for instance to strong exports, the resurgence of COVID-19 could have negative impacts in the future.",
        "The member expected that, looking into specific sectors, while private consumption was unlikely to rebound sharply even in the coming year, facilities investment would maintain a trend of recovery, bolstered by the resumption of investment in the non-IT sector, and construction investment would shift to an increase next year after showing sluggishness so far.",
        "The member saw that, despite the resurgence of COVID-19, exports would maintain a trend of improvement next year as well, thanks to a gradual global economic upturn.",
        "The member noted that employment was likely to improve, albeit moderately, thanks to the recovery in demand for face-to-face services stemming from gradually decreased effects of COVID-19.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that it would take considerable time for employment to return to the pre-pandemic level, and thus careful attention should be paid to situations in vulnerable sectors, such as services industries and temporary workers.",
        "The member, meanwhile, expected prices to show growth somewhat higher than that seen this year, due mainly to a rise in global oil prices and a smaller decline in administered prices.",
        "The member noted that, although in the November outlooks the GDP growth forecast for next year was revised slightly upward from the previous forecast, uncertainties surrounding the domestic and global economies were very high.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for thorough monitoring of various possible upside and downside risk factors.",
        "The member saw that, although the economy would show moderate recovery from next year, the negative GDP gap would be expected to last for a considerable time, and inflation was projected to run well below the target.",
        "The member thus judged that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the international financial markets remained stable, thanks to subsided risk aversion stemming from expectations for vaccine development, and the domestic financial markets also showed stability.",
        "The member noted that the financial markets had swiftly regained stability following the COVID-19 outbreak thanks to bold responses taken by the Bank of Korea and the government.",
        "The member, however, was concerned that under the current accommodative financial conditions which had been created in this process, household debt was increasing rapidly.",
        "The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that, although the exchange rate had smaller impacts on prices and exports compared to the past, the latest sharp increase in exchange rate volatility should still be closely monitored.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned points, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "continued to recover, but the pace of recovery has been slow due to the ongoing resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "In global financial markets, risk aversion has subsided on improvement of economic indicators and hopes for coronavirus vaccine development.",
        "Stock prices in major countries and government bond yields have risen and the US dollar has weakened.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine development, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "the recovery in private consumption has been slow and the correction in construction investment has continued, facilities investment has started to recover and the improvement in exports has continued.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by exports and investment.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated.",
        "GDP is projected to grow at slightly below -1% in 2020 and around 3% in 2021. decline in the prices of public services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) recorded a negative rate, and the inflation expectations of the general public have moved down slightly within the upper-1% range.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time and then moderately increase to around 1% in 2021.",
        "Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen significantly while long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators.",
        "Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country.",
        "and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability such as household debt growth, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member evaluated that there had been a significant change in the domestic and international financial and economic environments since the February meeting.",
        "The member pointed out that the rapid nationwide and international spread of COVID-19 had contracted economic activities tremendously and heightened volatility in the financial and commodity markets.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the possibility could not be ruled out of an extreme situation where the contraction in economic sentiment led to a vicious circle between the real economy and financial markets, undermining financial system stability just as during the global financial crisis.",
        "The member noted that this perception of the current situation was a reason for holding today’s interim meeting and argued that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member stated that major central banks had recently been strengthening their accommodative monetary policy stances through rate cuts and quantitative easing policies, while the Korean government and the National Assembly were also compiling a supplementary budget.",
        "In this regard, the member went on to assess that the central bank’s Base Rate cut would be significant in terms of international monetary policy cooperation and also in terms of the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy.",
        "The member mentioned that, if the central bank lowered the Base Rate to a record-low in the 0% range, this would have the positive impact of boosting the real economy, including growth and inflation, by reducing borrowing costs for households and businesses.",
        "The member went on to state that, at the same time, however, this could add to the negative side effects of low interest rates in financial stability terms, such as an over-concentration of capital in the housing market or a possible outflow of foreigners’ investment funds, which had been of concern to the MPB.",
        "The member took the view that, in light of this, it was essential to have a mix of macroprudential and tax policies that would more firmly ensure stability of the housing market and foreigners’ capital flows.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate by 50 basis points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member assessed that COVID-19 was spreading worldwide at a faster-than-expected pace and its future trajectory had become extremely uncertain.",
        "The member pointed out that the priority should be placed upon aggressive disease control and sufficient financial support for the sudden surge in disease control activities.",
        "The member added that aggressive financial support was also needed for businesses and vulnerable groups experiencing a temporary crisis triggered by an unexpected shock.",
        "On the other hand, the member evaluated the current real economic and financial market conditions as indicating that problems were spreading beyond the sectors directly exposed to COVID-19 to the entire economy.",
        "The member expressed concerns that global mobility restriction, as long as it continued, would inevitably exert a negative supply-side shock and that the global economic downturn was causing export demand to decline.",
        "The member went on to state that a vicious circle had been created in which worsening economic sentiment had been triggering instability in the financial markets as a whole, again contracting domestic demand and leading to a real economic slump.",
        "In other words, the member’s assessment was that COVID-19 was not only having impacts at the micro and sectoral levels but also developing into macroeconomic and aggregate demand shocks.",
        "The member also pointed out that, if this contraction in aggregate demand lasted for a longer period of time, Korea’s already low underlying inflation would decline even further and add to concerns about deflation risk.",
        "The member argued in this regard that an aggressive response was required through the concerted efforts of both the financial authorities taking microeconomic measures and the monetary authorities responsible for macroeconomic policies.",
        "The member expected that, although a Base Rate cut was unlikely to ease mobility restriction and thus boost consumption and investment directly, it would help reduce the burden of troubled households and businesses and curb the spread of financial market unrest, consequently easing the vicious circle of economic downturn through the aggregate demand channel.",
        "With all this taken into consideration, the member took the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points and continue to operate monetary policy flexibly going forward.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be advisable to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points from the current 1.25% to 1.00%.",
        "The member evaluated that COVID-19 had been spreading more quickly and extensively than expected over the past couple of weeks since the previous monetary policy decision meeting, and that as a result domestic and external economic conditions had been changing dramatically.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the outbreak of the virus, initially concentrated in Northeast Asia, had become a pandemic, and that this was heightening global economic uncertainty and greatly aggravating domestic and overseas financial instability.",
        "The member mentioned that what should be noted in discussing the necessary policy responses to deal with this situation was that, amid an increasing possibility of the demand contraction continuing longer than expected, the cash flows of goods and services suppliers were worsening.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that this liquidity issue was as of now limited to small business owners and SMEs and thus direct and selective liquidity support for damaged sectors still seemed more effective, but considering the following matters, it would be desirable to implement a rate cut as well at this meeting.",
        "First, the member noted that, looking at the recent trend of credit spreads in major countries and international financial markets, the possibility could not be ruled out that Korean companies’ liquidity issue could become more and more serious or develop into a more extensive credit crunch issue amid increasing risk aversion in the financial markets.",
        "Next, the member pointed out that, although it was difficult to predict the medium- and long-term impacts of the virus outbreak on the economy, its negative impacts were highly likely to last longer than usual, since social distancing and mobility restriction were regarded as the best available measures to control the disease in most countries.",
        "Accordingly, the member’s assessment was that, even if the spread of the virus outbreak eased, the economic rebound in the course of recovery could be only modest compared with the past, and in this regard, downward pressures on the medium-term growth path and inflation were actually growing.",
        "Finally, the member evaluated that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would be needed, given that financial conditions were estimated to become less easy with the sharp drop in risky asset prices and the rise in their volatility in the financial markets, and assessed that a crowding-out effect might occur due to increased bond issuance to finance the supplementary budget.",
        "Meanwhile, concerning the degree of Base Rate adjustment, the member took the view that, although the US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts had led to an increase in policy flexibility for non-key currency countries, attention should be paid to heightening volatility and credit risk aversion in the global financial markets.",
        "The member added that if concerns about global economic recession mounted, this could lead to heightening volatility in the domestic FX market.",
        "For this reason, the member stated that it would be appropriate to gradually adjust the degree of monetary easing while closely monitoring changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, rather than using up traditional monetary policy space within a short time, and suggested a 25 basis point rate cut in this regard.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it was desirable to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member expected that the economic spillover effects of COVID-19, which had been spreading rapidly since the February MPB meeting, would be greater and last longer than previously forecast.",
        "The member thus judged that, since the likelihood had increased that the contraction of economic activity would lead to permanent losses in production capacity and labor, it was desirable to cut the Base Rate by 50 basis points.",
        "The member expected international financial markets to stabilize to some extent, thanks to various monetary policy measures taken by the US Federal Reserve on March 15, and to global measures to support the provision of US dollar liquidity in line with consultations among major central banks.",
        "On the domestic front, the member judged that at this time it was of utmost importance not only to strengthen the policy efforts to expand social safety nets and provide financial support for small business owners, but also to secure as much as possible the conditions for domestic firms to overcome the current situation while minimizing production capacity losses.",
        "The member thus took the view that the adoption of several additional measures should be considered again, depending on how relevant conditions develop.",
        "The member, however, added that, in order to enhance the efficiency of this highly expansionary monetary policy and curb financial imbalances, it was urgently needed to supplement the system which might induce concentration in the credit channel.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it was appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, since the spread of COVID-19 had gathered pace across the globe since the previous MPB meeting, the negative impacts on the economy were rapidly increasing.",
        "The member saw that, particularly since the spread had started in the US and the EU, pillars of the global economy and finance, the situation was no longer a regional shock but had evolved into a global economic shock.",
        "The member added that, since uncertainties related to the coronavirus itself remained high, global financial market unrest had intensified and the global financial system had become more unstable.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the domestic spread of COVID-19 was showing signs of slowing somewhat, the negative impacts on the domestic economy were increasing as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified into a global economic shock.",
        "The member also pointed out that heightened asset price volatility due to the increased global financial market unrest was also negatively affecting the domestic financial markets.",
        "The member saw that it was necessary to prepare for large declines in the growth and price paths this year, and in the short term actively cope with the heightened liquidity risk for all economic agents.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that bold monetary policy measures should be implemented, going beyond increased liquidity support for vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member thus argued for cutting the Base Rate by 50 basis points.",
        "Another member stated that it would be desirable to revise the Base Rate downward from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.",
        "The member noted that the aftershocks of COVID-19 had appeared to be confined to China and Korea at the time of the February MPB meeting.",
        "The member, however, evaluated that the subsequent spread of the virus to the rest of the world, including the US and Europe, had developed into a crisis situation that raised concerns about shocks to global economic activity and global financial markets.",
        "The member saw that, with the real economy including growth and prices worsening more severely compared to the February forecast, the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets had been seriously affected due to heightened volatility in the international financial markets.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that a relatively significant cut in the Base Rate was unavoidable to respond to downside risks to the real economy and to ease volatility in the financial markets.",
        "The member declared that the most important responsibility for financial stability under the current conditions was stability in the financial markets.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that monitoring of the real estate market and the household debt issue should also continue in the future as well.",
        "The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to revise the Base Rate downward from the current 1.25% to 0.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member added that measures deemed necessary for financial market stability should continue to be actively reviewed.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Lim, Jiwon expressed clear opposition to lowering the Base Rate by 0.50 percentage points and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision `□` The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.25% to 0.75%, effective March 17, 2020.",
        "`□` Since the last Monetary Policy Board meeting, concerns about global economic slowdown have deepened with COVID-19 spreading globally.",
        "The spread of the outbreak has also resulted in a significant increase in the volatility of major price variables, including stock prices and exchange rates, in domestic and global financial markets and a sharp fall in international oil prices.",
        "The Board, therefore, judged that further monetary policy accommodation is called for in order to ease volatility in the financial markets and reduce the effects on future economic growth and inflation.",
        "`□` Considering the high level of uncertainties regarding financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance going forward so as to reduce the downside risks to the real economy and ease volatility in the financial markets.",
        "After briefings by staff on Economic Outlook (February 2020),[2)] FX and International Finance Trends, and Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, looking at the global economy, uncertainties surrounding the global economy and trade had increased due to the new COVID-19 shock amid weaker growth in major economies.",
        "Members diagnosed that volatility in global financial markets had increased, with government bond yields and stock prices falling substantially in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, members saw global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the degree of the spread of COVID-19.",
        "Members’ evaluation was that since the end of last year the domestic economy had been showing signs of partial recovery thanks to reduced uncertainties related to trade disputes and to the completion of semiconductor price adjustments.",
        "Members, however, saw that uncertainties had increased greatly due to the unforeseen COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "By sector, members expected large negative impacts on private consumption and the services sector, due mainly to a contraction in domestic consumption and a decline in the number of foreign tourists.",
        "Members noted that the impact on the manufacturing sector appeared to have been limited so far, but if the spread of COVID-19 continued for a prolonged period of time, negative impacts such as adjustments in employment and investment could increase.",
        "Members’ assessment was that, although inflation was following the expected trajectory, showing a faster increase due to the easing of supply-side downward pressures, there was a possibility of heightened volatility in consumer prices due to the spread of COVID-19.",
        "Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members assessed that stock prices and long-term interest rates had fallen due to strengthened risk aversion stemming from the spread of COVID-19, and stressed that it was necessary to pay attention to the possibility of greater volatility.",
        "Members judged that, since housing prices continued to show upward trends, particularly in some parts of the Seoul metropolitan area, and household lending showed steady growth, it was necessary to keep a constant eye on a possible buildup of financial imbalances.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%, while two members called for lowering it by 25 basis points.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.25% by 25 basis points at the current meeting.",
        "The member noted that a new negative shock, COVID-19, had hit the domestic economy since the January MPB meeting.",
        "The member saw that growth in major economies had been revised downward due to the shock in China, a major axis of global trade and the division of labor structure.",
        "The member thus saw that world growth for this year would likely remain at a level not very different from that in 2019, contrary to initial expectations.",
        "The member commented that the new shock had expanded uncertainties surrounding global trade, which had sharply contracted due to the shock from the US-China trade dispute last year.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although a virus or natural disaster generally acted as a temporary shock, it had become difficult to predict the severity and duration of the impacts of COVID-19 on consumption and investment patterns and economic sentiment on a global basis, since the spread of COVID-19 had accelerated in multiple countries including Korea in the last week.",
        "Therefore, the member expected that it would be possible during the second quarter or later to judge whether world trade would show a recovery this year compared to last year.",
        "Taking a detailed look at domestic demand, the member expressed the view that, even before the COVID-19 shock, consumption in January had already reversed to a substantial decrease, which appeared to have been led by consumption of passenger cars.",
        "The member noted that this implied that the consumption recovery seen in December and the fourth quarter of 2019 was mainly because demand for passenger car purchases had been pushed forward due to a temporary cut in the individual consumption tax.",
        "Seeing no clear recovery in consumption, the member judged a sharp contraction in domestic demand, including consumption, to be inevitable due to the COVID-19 shock, at least during the first quarter.",
        "The member found it hard to come up with a meaningful growth forecast for this year in the current situation with COVID-19 spreading.",
        "The member, however, noted that, based on an optimistic scenario in which the COVID-19 outbreak would be contained in the first quarter, growth at around 2% would be possible.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that inflation was generally following the movement of the expected path.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to continue to fluctuate due to one-off factors, such as agricultural and livestock products, with core inflation in the mid- to upper-0% range acting as an underlying trend.",
        "The member saw that, if the economic growth rate for this year remained unchanged from the previous year’s level due to the COVID-19 shock, the negative output gap would likely be the largest since the global financial crisis.",
        "The member judged that it was highly likely price inflation for this year would be less than 1%, given weak inflation in the period of 2012 to 2013 and in consideration of the above-mentioned economic and inflation trends, it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.00%.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level at the current meeting, as was done at the previous meeting, for the following reasons.",
        "The member first noted that for now it was more necessary to selectively support vulnerable groups and specific industries in response to a contraction in economic sentiment and production setbacks stemming from COVID-19.",
        "The member added that, although domestic conditions remained uncertain and the negative spillover effects on the global economy were large, COVID-19 was not yet forecast to cause permanent losses in domestic production capital and labor.",
        "Next, the member assessed that prices in January, which did not fully reflect the effects of COVID-19, continued to recover, albeit weakly.",
        "The member noted that, for instance, consumer price inflation in January with administered items excluded had risen to the 2% range.",
        "In addition, the member judged that monetary policy at the current level of the Base Rate was sufficiently accommodative in light of the neutral interest rate incorporating inflation expectations and the equilibrium interest rate based on productivity of the real economy.",
        "Finally, the member pointed out that the short-term benefits of additional easing could be smaller than the medium-term costs, because the financial imbalances that had built up due to low interest rates were reflected in the economic structure in a multifaceted manner.",
        "The member thus emphasized that, in order to ensure price stability in the medium term, it had become more important to rethink this dynamic trade-off.",
        "The member explained the reasons as follows.",
        "The member noted that theoretically a downward trend in the neutral interest rate could be explained by growth in the savings ratio estimated based on financial assets.",
        "The member commented that the savings estimated based on financial assets had expanded from 2.3 times GDP in the mid-1980s to 4.4 times now, while the savings ratio from Korea’s national accounts remained flat at the mid-30% level of GDP, showing no major change during the same period.",
        "The member added that this meant that the value of the expanded savings had fallen to half of the level seen in the 1980s on a real purchasing power basis.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the decline in the neutral rate was due to this expansion in financial assets, and the current neutral interest rate level was running well below the equilibrium interest rate of the real economy that represented capital productivity.",
        "Accordingly, the member presented the opinion that resources induced by leverage had been inefficiently allocated and the expansion in financial assets had not been accompanied by growth in real production capacity, and these two factors had led to expanded financial imbalances.",
        "Specifically, the member noted that the value of accumulated facilities investment relative to GDP in Korea remained almost unchanged from the level seen in the 1980s, while the value of accumulated construction investment relative to GDP had increased by more than 1.7 times during the same period.",
        "The member went on to argue that this investment herd behavior had caused returns on construction investment to be reduced from 1.5 times returns on facilities investment to been a policy to secure a market environment that could guarantee efficient allocation of investment, the potential growth rate in Korea would have been higher than now.",
        "The member’s assessment was that financial imbalances not only threatened stability in the financial markets, but also caused a decline in the potential growth rate and acted as downward inflationary pressures on the real economic side.",
        "The member went on to point out that if this issue were addressed by maintaining the policy rate at a level lower than the neutral interest rate, which had already fallen below the equilibrium interest rate, the markets’ self-recovery function would weaken and the burden on the economy would increase in the medium term.",
        "The member emphasized once again that in the current situation in which the buildup of financial imbalances had expanded not only in Korea but also in most advanced economies due to the negative side effects of prolonged accommodative monetary policies, it was very important to rethink the dynamic trade-off mentioned above.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that, if the spillover effects of COVID-19 continued to increase and the economic outlook worsened so as to raise concern about permanent losses in the economy, the mix and degree of macroeconomic policies should be changed in response.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, according to major economic indicators at home and abroad published since the previous MPB meeting, as manufacturing sluggishness had eased, led by IT industries, the global economy had been having more positive effects on Korea’s exports and manufacturing sector.",
        "The member, however, assessed that this economic trend would likely be disturbed greatly for some time due to the spread of COVID-19, and thus uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had heightened substantially.",
        "The member noted that, looking at the past SARS and MERS incidents, economic shocks stemming from infectious diseases or other non-cyclical factors had frequently caused short-term volatility, rather than leading to permanent production losses.",
        "The member, however, noted that COVID-19 was spreading very fast and widely and was heavily weighing on the economy of China, the biggest trading partner for Korea.",
        "The member thus saw that the short-term shock to the domestic economy could be much greater than past incidents of infectious diseases.",
        "The member mentioned that, given the role of Chinese manufacturing industries in the global supply chain and global trade flows, and the amount of local production by major Korean enterprises, production setbacks in China caused by the COVID-19 outbreak were direct and indirect risk factors for the domestic economy.",
        "The member voiced concern that if the COVID-19 outbreak lasted for a long time, closures, employment adjustments and investment corrections in major industries could continue and severely harm the growth path in the medium- to long-term through a vicious cycle associated with demand conditions.",
        "The member, however, expected that unless the spread of COVID-19 lasted for an exceptionally long time, the rebound in the growth rate over a medium-term horizon could be larger than in the past, through a rapid recovery in pent-up demand typically seen in the manufacturing sector, as well as through a gradual recovery in the services industry sector.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that in estimating downside risks to the future growth path, it was necessary to use various scenario analyses to take a balanced look at the possibility of heightened volatility stemming from short-term shocks and the possibility of changes in the economic trend in the medium term.",
        "With regard to consumer prices, the member noted that consumer price inflation had increased sharply due to an easing of supply-side downward pressures.",
        "The member’s judgement was that, although consumer prices were likely to be more volatile in the short term depending upon the government’s COVID-19 response measures and supply-side factors, the outlook that consumer price inflation in 2020 would be higher than in 2019 was still valid.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, in the financial markets, stock prices and long-term interest rates had fallen due to strengthened risk aversion affected by the spread of COVID-19, but capital flows in the credit market and foreign capital flows remained relatively stable.",
        "The member commented that this was somewhat differentiated with the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the MERS outbreak in 2015, primarily due to high expectations that the recent accommodative monetary policy stances in major countries would be continued for a long time.",
        "The member, however, stressed that the financial markets could be destabilized greatly in line with the developments in the spread of COVID-19, and therefore external soundness conditions and potential risk factors at home and abroad should be closely examined and prepared against.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting, while closely monitoring overall macroeconomic and financial market conditions at home and abroad for the time being.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the economic growth forecast for 2020 had been revised downward this time, if the impacts of the spread of COVID-19 were excluded, the current assessment of economic conditions and economic forecast were not very different from those in November last year, and inflation was evolving in line with original expectations.",
        "Looking at possible responses to cushion the economic shock, the member expressed the view that, referring to past cases of infectious diseases, where the spread was usually contained within three months, the amplitude of economic activity could be stabilized in the medium- to long-term horizon more effectively by, for example, using the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, which would allow selective support to specific sectors that had suffered damage, instead of cutting the Base Rate, which affects the economy with a time lag.",
        "The member also judged that, as the past two Base Rate cuts had worked to increase the degree of financial easing, liquidity in the current financial markets appeared to be sufficient to support the real economy.",
        "The member also noted that the credit cycle was estimated to be in an expansionary phase, and real estate-related exposures were relatively large.",
        "The member added that, given these points, it was necessary to constantly keep an eye on the possibility of a buildup of financial imbalances.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to cut the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current 1.25% level.",
        "The member mentioned that the economic downturn had been easing since the fourth quarter last year, as uncertainties related to the US-China trade dispute had decreased, the semiconductor price correction had been completed and monetary policies had been eased at home and abroad.",
        "The member, however, evaluated that it had been difficult to expect a significant economic recovery, as the exports outlook had remained unclear and domestic demand in the private sector had continued to be sluggish.",
        "The member pointed out that, in this situation, the COVID-19 outbreak was placing an additional burden on the domestic economy.",
        "The member assessed that as of now it was difficult to measure how serious the virus shock would be and how long it would last, but it was seen to act as a substantial downside risk to the domestic economy in the short term, causing a decline in domestic consumption and travel demand, a fall in exports demand from China and other regional economies, and setbacks to production owing to disrupted global supply chains.",
        "In terms of inflation, the member’s assessment was that it was uncertain whether the downward trend of underlying inflation was reversing, with core inflation remaining in the upper-0% range but consumer price inflation having rebounded to stand at 1.5% in January.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to gradually decline to the level of core inflation due to the decreasing impacts of factors causing short-term fluctuations, such as agricultural product and oil prices.",
        "The member also expressed concerns that a reversal of the underlying inflation trend would be even more unlikely if shocks from the virus outbreak lasted for a long time.",
        "The member meanwhile assessed that the surge in apartment prices in Seoul and some of its surrounding areas that had recently been the focus of public attention was the result of the recent acceleration of the widening gap over the past several decades between housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan region and the provincial areas and also between apartment and non-apartment prices, on the back of worsening economic sluggishness in the provincial areas and stronger restrictions on apartment supply.",
        "The member expressed the view that this widening gap was a serious social issue as it was a main factor deteriorating wealth inequality among regions and generations and that appropriate measures were accordingly required.",
        "The member took the view, however, that, given the fact that the Nationwide Housing Price Index was not rising rapidly, it seemed hard to find a good rationale for using monetary policy, which affects the formation of absolute prices nationwide and indiscriminatingly, to respond to fluctuations in apartment prices in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "The member argued that, in light of this, it would be advisable to cut the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 1.00% this time to support recovery of the domestic economy, which was facing growing negative shocks from the virus outbreak, and to help underlying inflation gradually converge to the target level.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member noted that it was the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 that had exerted an enormous impact on domestic and foreign financial and economic conditions since the January meeting.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although it was difficult as of now to predict how far the virus would spread and how long it would last, it would definitely have substantial negative impacts on consumption, investment and exports by contracting domestic and overseas demand and causing production setbacks.",
        "The member mentioned that prolongation of these negative impacts would put downward pressure on inflation as well as growth, and in light of this, the recent sharp decline in market interest rates, and the market expectations of a Base Rate cut reflected in it, were somewhat natural phenomena.",
        "The member however expected that a Base Rate cut would have only a limited positive effect on growth and inflation at this point in time.",
        "The member went on to evaluate that, amid weakened transmission of monetary policy overall since the global financial crisis, rate cuts were unlikely to improve the economic conditions in a situation where economic activities including consumption and investment shrank not because of economic factors but because of those related to healthcare and security.",
        "Furthermore, looking at past outbreaks, the member forecast that the worst would be limited to the first quarter of this year.",
        "The member also stressed concerns about an additional buildup of financial imbalances as potential side effects of a Base Rate cuts.",
        "In conclusion, the member took the view that it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period, and monitor virus outbreak developments and their impacts on domestic and overseas financial and economic outlooks for the second quarter onwards.",
        "The member meanwhile emphasized that, with the spread of COVID-19, it would be necessary to employ the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility to expand financial support for the troubled services sector due to the decrease in the floating population of Korean residents and foreigners and the reduction in events, and also for some manufacturers suffering from production setbacks owing to the disruption of global supply chains and the closure of workplaces.",
        "The member added that this would effectively help the economy recover rapidly once the virus subsided.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at 1.25%.",
        "The member evaluated that the domestic economy had seen signs of recovery in some sectors since the end of last year, but uncertainty had recently increased significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "The member went on to state that, looking at the global economy, major countries excluding the US were exhibiting weaker growth while the possibility of a rapid weakening of the Chinese economy had emerged, and added that oil prices were continuing to decline while international trade remained sluggish.",
        "The member mentioned that economic indicators had shown positive signs up until January, suggesting that there would not be any further economic slowdown this year, but economic agents had become more anxious, as seen in the recently plunging Consumer Sentiment Index and Business Survey Index.",
        "By sector, the member pointed out that private consumption and the services sector had been hit hard, and expressed concerns that the fall in service exports resulting from a decline in the number of foreign inbound tourists, as well as the contraction in consumption by Korean residents, was highly likely to continue for some time.",
        "The member stressed that, in the manufacturing sector, production setbacks in China had not yet caused a substantial delay in the intermediate goods supply or substantially slowed down production by China-based Korean firms, but a continued nationwide spread of the virus could negatively affect the manufacturing sector, and therefore close monitoring was required in this regard.",
        "The member added that it would be necessary to continuously examine future developments of facilities investment and exports, which had been expected to pick up due to improvements in the semiconductor industry and the ending of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member meanwhile expressed the view that, as the domestic financial markets had become far more volatile in line with surging uncertainties in the international financial markets, it would be necessary to closely monitor financial and FX market developments and, if needed, take bold measures.",
        "The member noted that it was difficult as of now to predict the effects of the spread of COVID-19, but looking at the past examples of the SARS and MERS outbreaks, in each case the economy had shown rapid recovery once the epidemic subsided.",
        "The member emphasized however that, considering China’s remarkably heightened profile in the global economy as well as in the Korean economy, it should not be overlooked that the current virus outbreak could have enormous negative effects on economic recovery.",
        "Finally, the member mentioned that, in terms of financial stability, the government’s real estate measures were expected to slow household debt growth, but the effects could be seen later than expected.",
        "Taking all these points into consideration, the member judged that at this point it was necessary to keep a close watch on virus developments and consequent macroeconomic and financial market conditions while maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member argued that support measures focusing on troubled sectors would be more effective, and expected that expanding the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility could be an appropriate measure.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho, Dongchul and Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economic growth has continued to slow with the ongoing sluggishness in trade.",
        "Volatility in global financial markets has increased.",
        "Government bond yields and stock prices have fallen in major countries and the US dollar has strengthened with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

        "in facilities investment has eased, consumption has contracted and exports have slowed owing to the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak while the adjustment in construction investment has continued.",
        "Employment conditions have continued to improve, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, below the November projection (2.3%), and the Board judges that uncertainties regarding the future growth path are high due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to the larger increase in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has increased to the upper-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the upper-1% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the lower-1% level and then fall slightly to record around 1% during this year, and core inflation will run at the upper-0% level.",
        "stock prices have fallen sharply and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably, affected by the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "The rate of household loan growth has risen slightly, and housing prices have increased at a relatively high rate, especially in the areas surrounding Seoul.",
        "economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while thoroughly assessing the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, its impact on the domestic economy, and changes in financial stability including household debt growth.",
        "Also, the Board will closely monitor developments in global trade disputes, the economies of major countries, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ evaluation was that the domestic economy would show growth generally consistent with the previous forecast.",
        "Members expected exports to show a trend of improvement, thanks to economic recovery in major countries.",
        "Members, however, thought that the recovery in private consumption would be delayed owing to ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19, despite the easing of social distancing rules.",
        "The majority of members stressed the need for selective support for vulnerable groups, noting that attention should be paid to the possibility of the domestic economy becoming less resilient if the deterioration in employment conditions becomes prolonged.",
        "Members saw that, although consumer price inflation had risen at a slightly faster pace due to one-off factors such as rising agricultural product prices, demand-side inflationary pressures were still weak.",
        "One member presented the view that attention should be paid to the point that the recent fall in the USD/KRW exchange rate could have a considerable impact on consumer prices.",
        "In addition, another member noted that close attention should be devoted to the possibility that changes in the demographic structure were affecting the declining trend of core inflation.",
        "Members noted that, although domestic and international financial and foreign exchange markets generally remained stable, it was necessary to be on the alert to the possibility of an accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "Some members raised concerns about faster growth in household lending amid accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.",
        "Other members stressed that attention should be paid to the fact that growth in high-risk asset prices was exceeding the pace of improvement in the real economy, due to stronger yield-seeking behavior of economic agents in the current accommodative financial conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, the majority of members expressed the opinion that, since the impacts of fiscal policy on financial markets and the real economy had become much greater, coordination with fiscal policy had to be considered in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "They added that the Bank of Korea should determine its position and expressly state its view concerning the new fiscal rules recently announced by the government and the controversy surrounding them.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, since the August meeting, financial markets had generally remained stable, while sluggish real economic conditions had persisted.",
        "Looking at the global economy first, the member noted that the Chinese economy was showing a trend of recovery, while the trends of improvement in the US, major European countries, and Japan were somewhat slowing.",
        "The member added that global trade sluggishness was easing, but at a slow pace.",
        "As for the domestic real economy, the member saw that the export slump had been easing to some extent since August, but domestic demand was unlikely to show rapid recovery.",
        "The member noted that, first, although private consumption had recovered somewhat from mid-September, it was highly likely to respond sensitively to developments related to COVID-19, since sluggishness in face-to-face services was continuing.",
        "The member forecast that, although exports had reversed to an increase in September backed by an increase in the number of days worked, the future of exports would be heavily dependent upon the evolution of the global resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "With respect to employment, the member voiced concern that much of the hiring slump since the COVID-19 outbreak continued to be seen in self-employed businesses in the services sector, where business conditions were sluggish.",
        "Meanwhile, the member expected the upward trend of consumer prices, which had accelerated in September, to decelerate again in October due to the government support for telecommunications fees.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that the recent real economic developments had remained close to the August outlook.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, despite expansionary policy by governments and central banks across the world, full-fledged recovery in the world economy would be highly unlikely until vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 were developed.",
        "The member also saw that the future recovery of the domestic economy was dependent upon how the COVID-19 situation would develop.",
        "Therefore, the member stressed that, in order to buffer against excessive contraction in the real economy and ramp up recovery, there still was a need to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member meanwhile raised the concern that, while domestic and international financial markets remained stable, household debt was continuing to show growth, despite the government’s stronger macroprudential policy.",
        "The member noted that, although rising asset prices were commonly seen in major countries including the US and Europe since the outbreak of COVID-19, movements in asset markets should be closely monitored when setting monetary policy.",
        "The member commented that, for the moment, no major central banks were attempting to change the monetary policy stance to reflect the overconcentration of funds into asset markets.",
        "As for the reason behind this, the member pointed out that accommodative monetary policy was having even larger positive impacts, such as moderating the excessive contraction in the real economy and rapidly regaining stability in financial markets.",
        "Finally, the member’s evaluation was that the recent expansionary fiscal policy was influencing the implementation of monetary policy through the government bond market.",
        "The member saw that, since the government had signalled that it would implement an expansionary fiscal policy next year as well, a balanced mix of fiscal and monetary policy would become even more important.",
        "The member thus stressed that the Bank of Korea should maintain its independence as the central bank, while at the same time working hard to develop ways to strengthen cooperation with the government’s policy measures.",
        "The member expressed the view that taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the two Base Rate cuts and several measures to expand liquidity provision implemented since March had contributed greatly to regaining stability in domestic financial markets following the COVID-19 shock, and to preventing rapid contraction in the real economy.",
        "The member noted that domestic financial markets were maintaining stability overall, with accommodative financial conditions continuing.",
        "The member added that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions appeared to remain seamless.",
        "The member diagnosed that, despite some differences across countries, the global economy had been maintaining a trend of improvement since May, and accordingly, the Korea’s export slump appeared to be easing.",
        "The member also noted that, while manufacturing production was gradually showing recovery, the trends of improvement in private consumption and services production had weakened, and employment also remained on the decline.",
        "The member assessed that, considering these points, the domestic economy did not appear to have emerged greatly from its overall sluggishness, despite its partial and moderate recovery.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, as the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing, external economic conditions remained highly uncertain.",
        "The member saw that the easing of social distancing rules taking effect this week was expected to have positive effects on the recovery of the domestic economy, but expected uncertainties surrounding the growth path to remain high.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, taking all those points into consideration, it was necessary to support improvement in the real economy by maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member thus judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic economy was showing a trend of moderate recovery.",
        "Specifically, the member noted that the trend of improvement in private consumption had weakened due to stronger social distancing rules following the resurgence of COVID-19, and the recovery in facilities investment had been subdued, particularly in the non-IT sector.",
        "The member, meanwhile, commented that export sluggishness had been easing gradually, thanks for instance to recovery in the Chinese economy.",
        "With respect to prices, the member added that consumer price inflation had risen to 1.0% in September due to a faster rise in agricultural, livestock, and fisheries product prices, and core inflation had also risen slightly to 0.6%.",
        "The member saw that, despite some differences across sectors, the recent economic and price trends had generally not diverged significantly from the paths projected in August.",
        "The member diagnosed that, despite ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19 conditions at home and abroad, it seemed unlikely that the pessimistic scenario laid out in the August forecast would materialize.",
        "The member explained that this was because the export slump had gradually been easing, and, on the domestic demand side, the effects of the accommodative monetary and fiscal policy measures taken so far were expected to continually rein in the negative impacts of COVID-19 and drive a recovery in demand from households and corporations.",
        "Looking at financial conditions, the member noted that, although market volatility had expanded to some extent of rate, market interest rates were generally fluctuating at an accommodative level and stock prices had rebounded after a significant correction.",
        "The member added that, although the USD/KRW exchange rate had fallen rapidly in the belated reflection of the sharp weakening of the US dollar, this was understood to reflect the relative stability of the domestic economy.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the easing of the monetary policy stance, including Base Rate cuts, was seamlessly feeding through to the entire financial markets, and was considerably moderating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the real economy.",
        "The member, meanwhile, expected the expansionary stance to strengthen further on the fiscal side.",
        "The member, however, stressed that attention should be devoted to the accumulation of the risk of financial imbalances, such as expanded household lending growth, in the course of implementing accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% and to closely monitor changes in macroeconomic trends and financial stability conditions in line with the future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Meanwhile, one member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 0.50%.",
        "Looking at economic conditions at home and abroad, the member noted that the world economy remained sluggish overall but was showing some improvement.",
        "The member assessed that, despite the continued spread of COVID-19, advanced economies had been recovering somewhat, centering around commodity consumption, boosted by accommodative financial and fiscal policies.",
        "In terms of the domestic economy, the member forecast that it would overall remain at the level forecast in August, as consumption had been sluggish affected largely by the resurgence of COVID-19, although exports to Korea’s major trading counterparts such as the US and China had been recovering.",
        "However, the member estimated that, since the recent domestic economic recovery had been led by exports and investment in some IT sectors, its trickle-down effects on household income and employment were limited.",
        "With regard to employment, in particular, the member pointed out that it remained sluggish, with the number of workers on temporary leave rising again significantly, and the number of persons employed continuing to exhibit a sharp decline, particularly in vulnerable groups including temporary workers, day laborers, and small business owners.",
        "The member expressed concerns that this could have aggravated the structural imbalances of the domestic economy and weakened its resilience.",
        "Meanwhile, the member forecast that inflation would remain low at the 0% level, influenced chiefly by low demand pressures and government policies.",
        "The member assessed that the gap between financial and real economic conditions was not narrowing, since the real economy was showing a very modest recovery while asset prices and credit to the private sector maintained strong growth.",
        "The member mentioned that it is somewhat inevitable for exogenous shocks such as COVID-19 to bring about trade-offs between the real economy and financial stability, and that an accommodative monetary policy stance was needed with priority placed on achieving real economic recovery, even if this stance gave rise to some financial imbalances.",
        "However, the member presented the view that additional easing would be unnecessary, considering possible improvement in domestic demand following the recent easing of social distancing measures, concerns about an increase in foreign bond investment fund outflows, and a rise in economy-wide leverage.",
        "The member in this regard emphasized the need to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the time being and monitor the transmission of monetary policy, while strengthening coordination with various policy measures.",
        "First, as for fiscal expenditure, the member noted that it would be necessary to examine various funding measures in addition to Treasury bond issuance, as the need to respond to the pandemic was compounded by structural factors such as the increased demand for welfare services.",
        "The member also took the view that stronger efforts were needed to focus on spending on sectors with large fiscal multiplier effects and to rationalize the expenditure structure.",
        "In addition, the member stressed that the government and regulatory authorities should implement macroeconomic and housing policies consistently in order to promote housing market stability and manage household debt in a stable manner.",
        "The member meanwhile expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to closely examine the effectiveness of the current methodology for measuring inflation indicators during the year-end review aimed at improving the operation of the inflation targeting regime, and also to pay more attention to the results of the recent overhauls of monetary policy frameworks in major countries.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member evaluated that the global economy had been picking up at a faster-than-expected pace, boosted by the recovery of consumption in advanced countries and China’s increased investment.",
        "The member stated that the decrease in global goods trade had not been as large as previously forecast and Korea’s exports would accordingly recover faster than originally expected.",
        "On the other hand, the member mentioned that, although downside risks had eased somewhat following the recent relaxing of social-distancing measures, domestic demand was unlikely to exhibit a strong recovery due to the lingering possibility of the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that prices had been recently showing only a weak rebound, merely shaking off deflation risk.",
        "The member argued that core inflation would run at the lower-0% range this year and remain well under the target of 2% next year as well, and in this regard, the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained for some time.",
        "The member expressed the view that, while some had called for particular attention to financial stability due to housing price rises and household debt growth, the focus of monetary policy should be placed on inflation and economic recovery when the real economy is hit by a large demand-side shock.",
        "The member noted that, although stabilizing asset prices was one of the considerations taken into account in conducting monetary policy, monetary policy affected the economy as a whole and therefore cost-benefit trade-offs should be closely examined.",
        "The member added that, since the current crisis had not arisen from any defects accumulated in the economic and financial systems, a lack of financial system resilience would not act as an obstacle to the economic recovery.",
        "Looking at the housing market, the member stated that housing prices continued to exhibit modest growth, but demand for housing investment was expected to go through a correction and slow gradually due to the strengthening of the housing-related tax and lending systems.",
        "The member emphasized that, although housing prices are sensitive to interest rates, it would be necessary to clearly understand that household purchasing power was much more important.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that, since the housing price rises over the last two to three years were not unrelated to the concentration of population and economic clout in Seoul and its surrounding areas, housing-related policies should be addressed from a long-term perspective and as part of balanced regional development policy.",
        "The member pointed out that the pandemic would end someday, but even if the crisis is controlled, the problems faced by the domestic economy `―` employment sluggishness, the population decline and aging, and worsening income distribution `―` would not go away.",
        "The member stressed that, regardless of the current crisis, Korea’s potential growth rate had shown a downward trend, and the monetary authorities should pay close attention to the decline in the real neutral interest rate resulting from the fall in the potential growth rate.",
        "The member also presented the view that the limitations of monetary policy focused on short-term interest rates under these conditions should be acknowledged.",
        "The member went on to argue that it would be necessary to examine the effectiveness of non-interest-rate monetary policy instruments that had been introduced in the course of coping with the current crisis, while remaining open to the use of other unconventional policy tools.",
        "With all the above taken into consideration, the member expressed the view that there was currently no need to adjust the monetary policy stance preemptively, and it would be therefore desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed the global economy as having emerged from the severe economic recession and as continuing to show a moderate recovery.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the growth rates of major countries had soared in the third quarter, their economies seemed to be improving at an increasingly slow pace.",
        "Above all, the member’s judgment was that uncertainty surrounding the future recovery path remained high, as measures to combat COVID-19 could be strengthened again and there were various geopolitical risks.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member evaluated that the trend of its improvement had been slowing somewhat due to the strengthening of social-distancing measures from mid-August until recently.",
        "The member however expressed the view that, since the negative impacts from the resurgence of the pandemic had been largely confined to face-to-face consumption and non-face-to-face consumption and exports had remained relatively favorable, downside risks to the economic outlook did not seem to have increased further.",
        "The member mentioned that, since the ongoing global economic recession had been caused by a healthcare issue, not an internal economic problem, overall economic developments had been different from normal cyclical fluctuations, with the most noteworthy points being the sluggishness of the services sector and the differentiation in business conditions among industries.",
        "The member explained that production adjustments in the manufacturing sector normally acted as a major factor behind global economic fluctuations while the services sector was relatively stable with a lag, but since the outbreak of COVID-19, economic activities in the services sector had also declined significantly, worsening the economic recession.",
        "The member went on to state that, as consumption behavior had been changing due to the social-distancing measures, the correlation of individual industries with economic conditions had weakened and the recovery path had differed significantly from sector to sector.",
        "The member expected that, although manufacturing production had rebounded since the third quarter and the business climate had been partly improving, it would take substantial time for this trend, coupled with demand conditions, to spread to all industries including the face-to-face services sector.",
        "The member noted that the widening gap between business conditions of individual industries and sectors since the outbreak of COVID-19 pointed to the continued need to selectively support damaged sectors in the conduct of macroeconomic policy.",
        "The member meanwhile pointed out that, as financial conditions had loosened and economic agents’ yield-seeking behavior had continued to strengthen, growth in high-risk asset prices had been significantly outpacing improvement in the real economy.",
        "The member noted that this was in stark contrast with the usual pattern where asset price rises during an economic recovery phase were sequentially observed from low-risk to high-risk product groups in line with real economic improvement.",
        "The member thus emphasized that close monitoring would be needed.",
        "The member emphasized that, despite having some positive impacts, asset price rises that are extremely rapid or that stimulate household debt heighten financial vulnerability and limit the medium- and long-term growth paths, adding that a longer-than-expected delay in economic recovery could cause drastic asset price adjustments, leading to a rapid contraction of financial conditions.",
        "The member went on to stress that continued vigilance and policy preparations were required in this regard.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member judged that at this point it was necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% while continuing to examine the need for selective support for damaged sectors as well as market stabilization measures.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "to recover from its earlier sluggishness, but the pace of recovery has slowed due to a resurgence of COVID-19 and measures taken to contain it.",
        "In global financial markets, major asset price variables including stock prices and bond yields have fluctuated considerably, due to concerns about a resurgence of the coronavirus and changes in expectations about economic stimulus in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses.",
        "the slump in exports has eased, gains in private consumption have been tepid as the number of newly confirmed cases increased again.",
        "The recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, and the correction in construction investment has continued.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year.",
        "Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by exports.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated.",
        "GDP growth is projected to be generally consistent with the August forecast of -1.3%.",
        "increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products due to severe weather conditions.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to near 2%.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time, reflecting various effects such as the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "fallen sharply, while long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements.",
        "Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase at high rates in all parts of the country.",
        "economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be slow and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the resurgence of COVID in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ evaluation was that the global economy had started to rebound moderately from its sluggishness, as economic activity had resumed in major economies.",
        "Members, however, diagnosed uncertainties surrounding the outlook for recovery as remaining high, as the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 or a protracted pandemic had increased.",
        "Members assessed that the international financial markets remained stable overall, influenced for instance by bold responses by individual countries.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, members saw that downside risks to growth had grown compared to the May forecast, as exports and the capacity utilization ratio still remained sluggish, despite moderate improvements in demand-side conditions, such as private consumption and facilities investment.",
        "One member, in particular, expressed concern that there was a repeated pattern in which the domestic economy was excessively reliant on the semiconductor industry.",
        "Concerning employment, members’ assessment was that there still was no clear sign of recovery in terms of either quality or quantity.",
        "Members saw that the low demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from a continued real economic downturn were ongoing.",
        "Members noted that inflation would remain down in the lower-0% range for some time due to a continued decline of public service prices amid weakened demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Finally, members evaluated that domestic financial markets were gradually stabilizing, thanks for example to policy rate cuts and various market stabilization measures.",
        "Members, however, pointed out that concerns about financial imbalances had heightened, as prices of assets such as housing and stocks had risen rapidly of late and household lending growth had accelerated.",
        "Members went on to emphasize the need to bear in mind the fact that rising asset prices divorced from economic fundamentals could work to destabilize markets in the future.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member assessed that, although lockdown measures had been eased, the prospects for a bottoming out of the global economy still remained uncertain as the spread of COVID-19 gathered pace.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, the member saw that private demand was sluggish despite the expansion of government spending.",
        "The member especially noted that negative growth would be deeper than expected due to a significant decline in exports.",
        "The member assessed that exports in Korea had been hit hard as the coronavirus shock to global trade was larger than originally forecast, with geopolitical conflicts also playing a role.",
        "Concerning employment, the member’s evaluation was that, although the number of persons employed had declined by a smaller margin, the situation remained serious given the number of persons on temporary leave and the broader unemployment rates.",
        "The member also pointed out that, with consumer price inflation remaining around the 0% range, various underlying price indicators such as “core inflation excluding administered prices” and “cyclically sensitive inflation” all remained unusually low in the 0% range.",
        "The member noted that economic and social concerns about overheating asset prices had increased, as prices of assets such as stocks and housing had risen more rapidly while the real economy was more sluggish than expected.",
        "The member added that as increased liquidity was allocated to sectors less likely to stimulate production, such as real estate and leasing, there was concern that the productivity of finance was decreasing.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member saw that there remained aversion to credit risk in the corporate lending and bond markets, and differentiation based on the financial situations and credit risks of corporations was continuing.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, contrary to past crises triggered by financial system shocks, the recent economic conditions caused by COVID-19 were by nature a real economic crisis.",
        "The member thus commented that, even with monetary policy on an accommodative footing, a significant time gap before the real economy recovered would be unavoidable, and in this process, financial imbalances, including concentration of capital into specific sectors and build up of debt, were inevitable to some extent.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, overall, monetary policy should maintain its current accommodative stance, prioritizing improvements in macro indicators such as growth, inflation and employment, in response to the wider-than-expected spread of COVID-19 and domestic and international economic sluggishness.",
        "The member added that it was necessary to use supplementary monetary policy instruments for a more seamless functioning of financial intermediation, and to make better use of macroprudential policy related to asset prices.",
        "The member thus judged that it was appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level this month.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member noted that contrary to expectations that the COVID-19 pandemic would ease in the US and other major economies, and their real economies would recover from the third quarter, new confirmed cases across the world had reached a record high while lockdowns had not been lifted much.",
        "The member voiced concern that, given the current low global trade growth, it would be hard to expect a rapid recovery of the global economy, and this would negatively affect the domestic economy.",
        "The member thus saw that the pace of recovery in domestic private consumption and exports would slow after the second half of this year.",
        "The member noted in particular that, since the expectation for improvements in exports was mainly dependent upon IT sectors including semiconductors, the past pattern in which economic growth was excessively reliant on growth in the semiconductor industry was being seen again.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that downside risks to growth in both exports and domestic demand had increased from the May forecasts, since facilities investment was also mainly dependent upon investment in the IT sector, and construction investment would likely to continue to go through its ongoing adjustment for some time.",
        "Concerning employment, the member expressed the view that, although the negative impacts of COVID-19 had been partially eased, employment had not yet recovered from its sluggishness.",
        "The member noted that, although the government and the Bank of Korea had been taking various measures to ensure the recovery of the real economy, a failure to properly and swiftly deal with the liquidity issue in the corporate sector could lead to the more serious problem of insolvency.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to continue policy efforts to deal with this in the future as well.",
        "Looking at prices, the member’s assessment was that the sluggishness in the real economy so far had increased downside pressures on inflation.",
        "In other words, the member was of the view that low demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from the continuation of the negative output gap had been leading to the widening of the negative inflation gap.",
        "The member expected that inflation could remain well below the target for a considerable time going forward.",
        "The member, meanwhile, evaluated that the domestic and international financial and foreign exchange markets were gradually regaining stability.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that it was necessary to keep in mind that the financial market trends, which had been moving apart from the real economy, could actually work to cause instability if the markets’ positive expectations about the real economy were to shift rapidly.",
        "The member noted that accommodative financial conditions were having an effect with respect to rising prices in asset markets, such as stock and real estate markets.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that the continuation of the accommodative monetary policy stance was inevitable in consideration of real economic conditions, which would remain sluggish for a considerable time.",
        "The member noted that issues in some asset markets should be addressed through bold policy responses by the government.",
        "The member added that the Bank of Korea, together with the government, had many issues to consider to ensure stability in the financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, looking at recent domestic economic conditions, even though private consumption was rebounding, a significant decline in exports was continuing and thus the outlook for the domestic economy was more sluggish than the May forecast.",
        "The member, however, expected that the domestic economy would recover gradually, as exports would shift to an increase in line with a recovery in the global economy, although there still were high uncertainties related for example to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic at home and abroad.",
        "The member added that the recovery could be constrained by the risk of structurally lower growth affected by COVID-19 and by several geopolitical risks such as a rekindling of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member also forecast that inflation would likely remain in the lower-0% range for some time due to a continued decline of public service prices in line with, for example, the expanded provision of free education, as well as to economic sluggishness.",
        "The member noted that, right after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Bank of Korea had actively expanded the degree of monetary accommodation to deal with the real economic slump and financial market unrest, by making large cuts in the Base Rate and increasing the supply of liquidity.",
        "The member evaluated that, as a result, financial conditions had improved greatly.",
        "The member saw that market interest rates, as well as deposit and lending rates in the banking sector, had fallen to historic lows; growth in private-sector credit and market liquidity had sharply accelerated; and stock prices had recovered to the level seen before the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "The member expected the transmission of these monetary policy measures to the financial markets to have positive effects on the real economy after a time gap.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that concern about financial imbalances was increasing with housing prices rising rapidly and household lending growth expanding again.",
        "The member voiced concern that amid the current ongoing economic sluggishness, if asset prices were overvalued or debt excessively increased regardless of economic fundamentals, the risk of a sudden adjustment would increase by the same degree.",
        "The member noted that, in consideration of these economic and financial conditions, it would be best to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time.",
        "The member saw the need to maintain an accommodative monetary policy since there still were high uncertainties surrounding the future growth path and downside risks also existed.",
        "The member, however, commented that it was necessary to exercise caution with respect to any further easing, considering that recent financial conditions marked by low interest rates and ample liquidity appeared to be sufficient to support the recovery of the real economy.",
        "The member also saw that, given recent housing price increases and household debt growth, more consideration should be given to financial stability than in the past in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The member, meanwhile, emphasized that the role of the government and the supervisory authorities was very important for market liquidity to flow into productive sectors and thereby support the real economic recovery more effectively, in a situation in which maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance was unavoidable.",
        "One member meanwhile presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.",
        "The member evaluated that there was ample liquidity in the market as a result of two Base Rate cuts and various measures to increase liquidity supply since March.",
        "The member’s assessment was that financial markets had generally stabilized, although sustained demand contractions at home and abroad due to the COVID-19 outbreak had led to concerns about continued deterioration of corporate profitability and to a delay in improvement in funding conditions of sub-par companies.",
        "The member assessed that the international financial markets had also generally stabilized, in terms for example of foreign exchange supply and demand conditions.",
        "On the other hand, the member argued that attention should be paid to the increasing factors likely to undermine financial stability, with household and other private sector credit recently growing rapidly and a larger amount of floating money continuing to flow into asset markets.",
        "The member stated that the global economy remained highly uncertain with COVID-19 resuming its rapid spread in major countries, and in this regard, the member forecast that the sluggishness of Korea’s exports and uncertainty of its real economy would continue for the time being.",
        "The member’s assessment was that consumption and facilities investment had been recently showing gradual recovery, while exports had remained lackluster, the manufacturing capacity utilization ratio had remained low and employment had not shown any clearly marked recovery yet.",
        "With these taken into account, the member mentioned that the growth rate was highly likely to be lower than the May forecast.",
        "The member also anticipated that any substantial inflation pressures would not be seen for some time.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting period to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member also argued that it would be necessary to closely examine the ripple effects of the policy measures implemented so far while monitoring financial market conditions and the real economic trend.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 0.50%.",
        "Looking at the economic conditions at home and abroad since the previous monetary policy decision meeting, the member evaluated that the economic shocks from COVID-19 appeared to have somewhat passed their peak, but uncertainties surrounding the recovery path seemed to remain high.",
        "The member stated that real economic sluggishness in some major countries including the US, euro-area countries and China had been somewhat easing recently, but this was a result of the combined effect of a technical rally in line with a phased resumption of economic activity, recovery of pent-up demand, and various policy support measures, and it was therefore uncertain whether this would lead to a substantial economic recovery in the second half.",
        "The member noted that vigilance was needed most of all against the fact that COVID-19, the main cause of the current global economic slump, was likely to abate later than originally forecast.",
        "The member argued that, although strong lockdown measures were unlikely to be implemented again, sustained pandemic-related uncertainties and social distancing could limit the degree of consumption recovery considerably, and some companies might go out of business permanently with structural changes caused by the pandemic becoming firmly entrenched.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member mentioned that, although real GDP had recorded further negative growth in the second quarter, demand-side conditions such as private consumption and facilities investment had been improving gradually, which provided relatively strong support for expectations of economic recovery in the second half.",
        "However, the member assessed that, considering the fading effects of income growth from the emergency rescue package and the downward trend of semiconductor prices, there was a growing probability of economic recovery falling short of the May forecast in the second half.",
        "The member also pointed out that this could weaken demand-side inflation pressures and increase downside risks to the price path.",
        "As to financial conditions, the member’s evaluation was that, driven mainly by the Base Rate cuts and various market stabilization measures, financial conditions had improved significantly, with price variable volatility decreasing and credit risk aversion easing gradually in capital markets.",
        "The member mentioned, however, that the possibility could not be ruled out of market interest rates rising again or volatility increasing further, as demand for non-prime corporate bonds was sluggish, credit supply to SMEs remained lackluster and a crowding-out effect might occur in the course of Treasury bond issuance to finance the supplementary budget.",
        "The member also noted that the continuing trend of low interest rates at home and abroad had been strengthening the yield-seeking behavior of economic agents, and in this regard, the member was alert to the possibility of increased risk of a buildup of financial imbalances due to the liquidity that had been supplied to support the real economy.",
        "More specifically, the member argued that attention should be paid to possible excessive flows of market liquidity into high-risk financial assets or real estate in a domestic financial environment that lacked moderate-risk financial products.",
        "The member noted that, despite a possible virtuous circle of stock or housing price increases leading to real economic growth through the wealth effect, if the gap between the asset markets and the real economy widened too much or asset price increases triggered household debt, this could increase financial vulnerabilities and limit the medium- to long-term growth path.",
        "In summary, the member stated that it was necessary to maintain accommodative monetary policy to support the real economy and stabilize inflation expectations, while market liquidity was concentrating in the short-term end of the market.",
        "The member thus argued that it would be desirable to maintain rather than expand the current degree of monetary easing and use various policy measures to promote a more effective transmission of financial market liquidity to the real economy.",
        "The member also argued that it would be necessary to remain flexible and balanced in deciding on policy options, while preparing for a possible prolongation of the pandemic and keeping in mind that the expansion of the liquidity supply from policy responses to the crisis could act as a financial vulnerability factor.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although financial markets had been stabilizing and the worst had passed for economic indicators thanks to the aggressive responses to COVID-19 around the world, global economic recovery remained uncertain in line with the growing possibility of a second wave of the pandemic and its prolongation.",
        "The member also forecast that, due to the delay in the recovery of global trade, the negative impacts of the pandemic on the domestic economy would last for longer than expected at the initial stage of the pandemic.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member forecast that the cyclical component of leading indexes and various sentiment indexes had been showing signs of recovery, but the economic recovery would be very moderate owing to the sustained emphasis on social distancing amid concerns about a second wave of the pandemic.",
        "In this regard, the member pointed to the need to maintain the current trend of low interest rates until the real economy showed a clearly marked recovery.",
        "The member meanwhile expressed the view that the Bank of Korea, which was maintaining an inflation targeting regime, should keep a close eye on the impacts of COVID-19 on inflation.",
        "More specifically, the member mentioned that the central bank should note that a slowdown in inflation was more evident outside of the Seoul metropolitan area than in Seoul and its surrounding areas, suggesting that COVID-19 shocks had differed from region to region.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the growth and employment slumps in regions other than the Seoul metropolitan area had built up over a long period of time, the COVID-19 pandemic had clearly revealed how serious these problems were.",
        "The member also expressed concerns that the pandemic was likely to accelerate the trend of the outflow of population from provincial areas and the inflow of population into Seoul and its surrounding areas, which had slowed for some time.",
        "In addition, the member presented the view that attention should be paid to the gap between general inflation and housing prices.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the gap was based on economic agents’ expectations of the trend of low interest rates becoming firmly entrenched, but was also related with the issue of regional imbalances.",
        "The member added that the recent acceleration of growth in apartment sales prices and leasehold deposit prices was more evident in Seoul and its surrounding areas than the rest of the country, which implied that housing prices, as well as business conditions and consumer price inflation, were showing different movements from region to region.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that COVID-19, having broken out in the course of the domestic economy’s gradual shift to a low-growth environment in line with demographic changes, was highly likely to strengthen the concentration of population in the Seoul metropolitan area.",
        "In this regard, the member stressed that the possibility of a worsening of regional imbalances should be taken into consideration in deciding on the direction of macroeconomic policies and their priorities, and went on to emphasize that the central bank and other financial authorities should work hard to develop ways to provide financial support to revitalize regional economies.",
        "The member assessed that since the March interim meeting the domestic financial and FX markets had stabilized somewhat in the accommodative monetary policy environment as seen in the two Base Rate cuts and the raised ceiling for the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility.",
        "The member took the view that the monetary easing stance should be maintained for the time being to meet market expectations, while keeping a careful watch on the effect of the expansionary fiscal policy being carried out by the government.",
        "The member added that in this regard it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting, and if needed, to increase Treasury bond purchases to promote the stability of overall market interest rates.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "rebound moderately from the sharp contraction, as economic activity gradually resumes despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19.",
        "In global financial markets, risk aversion has subsided on hopes of economic recovery.",
        "Stock prices in major countries have risen and the US dollar has weakened, while government bond yields have fluctuated slightly.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses.",
        "rebounded with the relaxation of some pandemic-related restrictions on economic activity and the government’s stimulus package, exports have continued to decline.",
        "While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the correction in construction investment has continued.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply.",
        "Looking forward, facilities and construction investment are expected to grow at a moderate pace; however, the paces of recovery in consumption and exports will be slower than previously forecast.",
        "Accordingly, GDP growth this year is likely to be lower than the May forecast of -0.2%.",
        "petroleum products and public services.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the lower-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed at the mid-1% level.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the lower-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "volatility in global financial markets.",
        "Stock prices have risen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen considerably, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range.",
        "The increase in household loans has expanded materially, and housing prices have generally accelerated in all parts of the country.",
        "economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Economic Outlook (August 2020),[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members agreed that, since economic recovery is forecast to be delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad, it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy to support the real economy and help stabilize inflation expectations.",
        "With respect to the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the growth rate was highly likely to decline significantly this year due to the resurgence of COVID-19, while downside risks to the growth path were high.",
        "By sector, members forecast private consumption to remain sluggish, affected mainly by a strengthening of social-distancing measures, and exports to exhibit a more modest recovery than originally expected due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries and a delay in the recovery of the semiconductor industry.",
        "Members also expressed concerns that the structural vulnerabilities of the domestic economy could deteriorate with human capital being undermined by the prolonged employment sluggishness and income distribution worsening.",
        "Members saw that, despite the rebound in global oil prices and the rise in agricultural product prices, inflation would remain low for the time being owing to the weakening of demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "One member pointed to the possibility that inflationary pressures were being underestimated, since housing price rises and imputed rents were not properly reflected in consumer price inflation.",
        "Members meanwhile pointed out that, although domestic and overseas financial and FX markets remained stable overall, it would be necessary to remain on the alert against the possibility of the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "Members expressed particular concerns about the possibility of the recent rapid increase in household unsecured loans leading to growth in leveraged investment in asset markets.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed to the need to examine the effectiveness of unsecured loan regulations.",
        "Some other members argued that it would be necessary to pay attention to the sustained strong M2 growth, particularly in the corporate sector, and closely monitor its relationship with the housing market.",
        "Finally, most members emphasized that attention should be paid to the possibility of a sudden worsening of funding conditions for SMEs if the pandemic persisted for a long time.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member forecast that, with the strengthening of social-distancing measures following the resurgence of COVID-19, economic recovery would slow and consumption in particular would shrink.",
        "The member also expected that, although the sluggishness of exports had been easing from the second half of this year, the pace of improvement in exports would be modest due to the continued spread of the virus in major countries.",
        "The member above all pointed out that demand for semiconductors, one of Korea’s major export items, had been slowing recently.",
        "The member however forecast that facilities investment and intellectual property product investment would remain relatively favorable.",
        "The member expressed concerns that the recent resurgence of COVID-19 would have negative impacts on labor demand.",
        "The member mentioned that, despite the gradual decline in the number of workers on temporary leave, the possibility could not be ruled out of a reversal in this trend.",
        "In particular, the member’s evaluation was that the COVID-19 outbreak had led to a slump in low- and middle-skilled face-to-face services industries, accelerating structural changes in income distribution and the labor market.",
        "The member went on to state that this could be supported by the sharp year-on-year decline in earned income and the worsening of earned income inequality seen in Statistics Korea’s household income and expenditure survey for the second quarter of 2020.",
        "The member expressed the view that in light of this it would be appropriate to maintain and extend government policy measures to ensure employment retention and income compensation, even if additional fiscal expenditure was required.",
        "The member meanwhile noted that the business climate for SMEs had not shown substantial improvement.",
        "The member assessed that their production and capacity utilization ratio seemed to have been recovering since June and July, but due to the resurgence of COVID-19 they were unlikely to emerge from their sluggishness.",
        "The member stressed that, since a prolonged spread of COVID-19 increased the possibility of SMEs showing poorer performances and having more difficulty in raising funds, it would be desirable for the Korean government and the Bank of Korea to maintain and extend the current financial support measures.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member took the view that, since anxiety and contracted market confidence were likely to continue negatively affecting the domestic economy for a considerable period of time, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level while using monetary policy tools other than rate decisions to respond to the possible cycle of contraction in the overall economy in which a decrease in one sector leads to a decline in another.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member evaluated that the domestic economy had exhibited a slower-than-expected recovery since the July meeting as recoveries in private consumption and facilities investment had been delayed, due mainly to the weakening of the effects of government policy measures and to limited economic activities during the rainy season.",
        "The member expected that, in the event of expanded and continued social distancing in line with the rapid resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad since mid-August, Korea’s exports and consumption would suffer large negative impacts.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member’s anticipation was that, although demand-side inflation pressures would be weak, consumer price inflation would slightly exceed the Bank of Korea’s previous projection this year, with agricultural product prices rising following heavy rains.",
        "The member assessed the financial and FX markets as having remained stable overall, despite the sluggish economic trend and the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member also mentioned that corporate financing had been generally favorable and growth in household loans, particularly unsecured ones, had accelerated again.",
        "The member took the view that the recent stable trends of the financial and FX markets had been attributable substantially to the Bank of Korea’s aggressive use of various policy tools, such as reducing the Base Rate significantly, expanding the liquidity supply, and concluding a currency swap agreement with the US Federal Reserve, to respond to the spread of COVID-19.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that, although this had led to growing concerns about the accumulation of financial imbalances such as the rapid growth in household debt and the over-concentration of capital in the housing market, it also had undoubtedly helped improve the funding conditions of economic agents and facilitate credit flows in general to prevent the real economy from contracting excessively during the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting and take more time to observe future developments of COVID-19 and economic trends.",
        "The member went on to state that this was because the financial and FX markets were relatively stable, credit flows were favorable overall, and the sluggishness of the domestic economy was expected to ease at a modest pace going forward.",
        "The member emphasized that, considering the extreme uncertainty concerning the future growth path in line with pandemic-related developments, it would be necessary to monitor more closely changes in financial and economic conditions and conduct monetary policy prudently.",
        "The member argued that it would be desirable to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance until it appeared that the impacts of COVID-19 were weakening and the domestic economic recovery was back on track.",
        "The member however added that particular attention should be paid to the risk of financial imbalances that might occur due to the prolongation of the accommodative policy stance.",
        "The member meanwhile argued that, if COVID-19 spread more excessively than expected, this could lead to an increase in credit risks for SMEs and to a recurrence of financial and FX market instability, and went on to stress the need to further strengthen related monitoring and adjust emergency measures.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the global economy, and the US and Chinese economies in particular, had been exhibiting a modest recovery since the July meeting, but the European and Japanese economies had continued to undergo difficulties.",
        "The member expressed concerns, in particular, that signs of a resurgence of COVID-19 in European and other major countries might delay global economic recovery.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the sluggishness of exports and consumption seemed to have been easing somewhat since the second quarter, but their outlooks had become substantially uncertain.",
        "More specifically, the member forecast that private consumption, which had been picking up since the second quarter, was likely to be more sluggish than expected, despite the government’s various support measures, due mainly to delayed improvement in household income and consumer sentiment following the resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "With regard to exports, the member pointed out that exports were unlikely to achieve recovery as originally forecast, affected largely by the resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries and a delay in the recovery of the semiconductor industry.",
        "The member, however, evaluated that facilities investment was favorable, boosted by strong IT-sector investment which more than offset a correction in non-IT sector investment, and that construction investment, although currently going through a correction, was also likely to face upside risk to growth, following repairs of damages from heavy rainfalls.",
        "In terms of employment, the member noted that, although the decline in the number of the employed had been slowing gradually, employment remained sluggish in the manufacturing and construction industries.",
        "The member argued that it would take time for workers on temporary leave, whose number had increased dramatically since the COVID-19 outbreak, to return to their jobs, and a substantial part of these workers were likely to fall into a state of unemployment.",
        "The member thus stated that related monitoring was required in this regard.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member expected consumer price inflation to remain within the lower-0% range and core inflation also to remain low, even when inflation pressures following heavy rains were counted in.",
        "The member mentioned that, as shown by the fact that the Research Department suggested both positive and negative scenarios in addition to the basic one when making a large downward adjustment to the original domestic economic growth forecast for this year, future economic conditions would vary depending on the severity of the COVID-19 resurgence.",
        "The member expressed the view that, with the negative output gap widening and the large inflation gap continuing, the current accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained to support a swift recovery of the real economy.",
        "The member meanwhile expressed concerns that, although the global financial markets and the domestic FX and financial markets had been stable, the over-concentration of capital in asset markets had been witnessed in Korea as well as the US and other major countries.",
        "More specifically, the member argued that attention should be paid to the fact that household debt had continued to grow despite the government’s stronger macroprudential policy, and that growth in household unsecured debt in particular had been recently leading to leveraged investment in the stock and real estate markets.",
        "The member emphasized that in this regard it would be necessary to keep a close watch on asset market trends and steadily draw up measures for encouraging capital flows into productive sectors so that accommodative monetary policy could support real economic recovery.",
        "The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it was desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level this time.",
        "Meanwhile, one member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 0.50%.",
        "Looking at economic conditions since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on July downturn, thanks to eased sluggishness particularly in the consumption of major countries.",
        "The member, however, added that uncertainties surrounding the future recovery path remained high, due to the ongoing global spread of COVID-19 and the continued trade-off between economic activity and the degree of disease control.",
        "The member noted that, concerning the domestic economy, expectations for economic recovery had increased, as domestic and international demand conditions showed signs of improvement.",
        "The member, however, assessed that the growth trend in the second half of this year was being significantly constrained by the rapid resurgence of COVID-19 recently and the increased negative impacts of natural disasters.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, although the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised the economic outlook downward in reflection of those points, there could be additional downside risks due to high uncertainties.",
        "The member thus added that there would be a need to support the real economy and stabilize inflation expectations by implementing an accommodative monetary policy for some time.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to the need for additional policy responses, the member noted that the following points were being considered.",
        "The member stated that, despite concern about the resurgence of COVID-19, the degree of financial easing was steadily expanding thanks to improvement in domestic and international financial conditions, which stood in clear contrast with what had been seen during the first wave of the virus.",
        "The member judged that, looking at recent movements of major liquidity indices and credit growth for reference, liquidity in the financial market was sufficient to support the real economy.",
        "The member, however, commented that volatility in the bond market could become greater due to a crowding-out effect stemming from increased government bond issuance, and domestic and international financial conditions could tighten again owing to a broad resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "The member thus pointed out the need for ongoing monitoring.",
        "Next, the member expected domestic consumption and services industries to contract sharply for some time, due to stronger disease control measures.",
        "The member, however, saw that, judging from external economic conditions, exports and the manufacturing sector would show a trend of improvement, albeit a moderate one.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the economic shock stemming from the resurgence of COVID-19 might be concentrated mainly on consumption related to face-to-face services rather than the entire macroeconomy, given that facilities investment was usually closely related to the trend of exports, not consumption.",
        "Finally, the member noted that a major cause of the contraction in consumption stemming from the resurgence of COVID-19 lay in stronger disease control measures such as social distancing.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that it would be desirable to place the focus of monetary policy on minimizing the worsening of cash flows of corporations and households that have suffered damage, not on boosting consumption.",
        "The member also pointed out the need to consider the possibility that the liquidity problems of afflicted corporations could gradually develop into solvency risks due to the prolongation of the pandemic.",
        "The member thus took the view that a more effective way to buffer against downside risks to the growth path in the medium to long term would be utilizing policy programs that can directly and selectively support specific sectors, rather than expanding the degree of monetary policy accommodation through Base Rate adjustments.",
        "The member saw that, taking all those points into consideration, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50% this time.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that domestic and international economic conditions had shown signs of improvement since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on July 16 but were worsening again.",
        "The member assessed that, although the degree of global economic slowdown was improving somewhat, thanks to the easing of restrictions on economic activity, uncertainties and downside risks had become even greater on expectations of a further prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The member also saw that contrary to original expectations that the domestic economy would not contract to a large degree, bolstered by relatively successful initial disease control and the Chinese economic recovery, the negative shocks would expand due to more-sluggish-than-expected global growth and the domestic resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "More importantly, the member assessed that the global trade slump’s direct impacts on our exports were unavoidable, that private consumption was continuing to decline significantly, and that recovery momentum in the investment sector was weak.",
        "The member forecast that the growth rate for this year would be below –1% for the third time, following the oil shock in 1980 and the Asian currency crisis in 1998, as the domestic economy recorded sharply negative growth in the second quarter and the future growth path had been adjusted downward.",
        "The member raised the concern that, against this backdrop, there was a greater risk of the economic structure becoming more vulnerable, due for example to the worsening of income distribution and erosion of human capital following a significant decline in employment.",
        "The member pointed out that, on the inflation side, demand-side pressures still remained weak, although the decline in inflation expectations had fortunately moderated.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, while the downside risks to the real economy had increased, the domestic financial market remained stable overall, and upside risks to some asset prices remained.",
        "The member noted that market interest rates and the exchange rate had fluctuated within a narrow range and foreign currency funding conditions also remained stable, thanks to the bold policy responses so far, despite the resurgence of COVID-19 of late.",
        "The member, however, saw that capital continued to flow into asset markets, such as the stock and real estate markets, and asset prices were still rising rapidly.",
        "The member thus pointed out that there remained economic and social concerns in this regard.",
        "The member voiced concern that, as both corporate and household sector debt increased rapidly, the risk of default in some vulnerable sectors could emerge and the increased debt servicing burden could weigh on the economic recovery with a time gap.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that there would be a need to expand selective financial support, since vigilance against low-credit companies still remained and economic activity could worsen further, despite growth in market liquidity.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, although further worsening of the real economy was expected, monetary policy should maintain the current accommodative level, while strengthening its cooperative relationship with various policy instruments, in overall consideration of the continued gap between the real economy and financial conditions, and significant deviations even within financial sectors.",
        "The member emphasized that it was important to stabilize the expectations for asset prices by making better use of related macroprudential policy measures and inducing the expansion of the supply base in the long term.",
        "At the same time, the member presented the view that it would also be necessary to actively utilize supplementary monetary policy instruments to ensure a more seamless functioning of financial intermediation.",
        "The member also added that, on the fiscal side, the Bank should actively set forth its views to ensure that the expansion of the fiscal burden would dynamically lead to a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution, while creating a favorable environment for fiscal expansion through low interest rates and purchases of Treasury bonds.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member evaluated that manufacturing production and the capacity utilization rate had increased, due to partial recovery in the world economy and a narrowing of the export decline, while services production had also sustained a modest recovery.",
        "The member, however, assessed that the recovery in private consumption had been sluggish since the beginning of July, due mainly to the rainy season and the scaled back individual consumption tax cut, as well as to the effect of reduced household transfer income.",
        "The member’s assessment was that inflation had somewhat increased of late, due to rising agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices stemming from the rainy season and heavy rainfall, while inflationary pressures still appeared low.",
        "The member, meanwhile, assessed that the domestic and international financial markets remained stable thanks to the various measures taken by the authorities of major countries and the Bank of Korea to date to increase the supply of liquidity.",
        "The member saw that foreign exchange supply and demand conditions also maintained stable movements.",
        "The member noted that the funding of domestic corporations was smooth, and corporate and household lending were continuing to increase substantially overall.",
        "The member, however, added that there was concern about inflows of abundant market liquidity into asset markets and the subsequent ongoing rises in stock and real estate prices.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that there remained high uncertainties surrounding the future domestic and international growth paths due to the ongoing global spread of COVID-19, despite partial recoveries in economic conditions at home and in major countries of late.",
        "The member voiced particular concern about an increased possibility that consumption, production and investment could contract again and the economic recovery could be delayed, following the recent accelerated spread of COVID-19 and stronger social distancing rules.",
        "Taking all this into consideration, the member expressed the view that it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance and it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, under the current domestic and international economic conditions, maintaining the current accommodative stance was inevitable, and this stance would have to be sustained for some time.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that it would be necessary to keep a close and careful watch on the potential for this stance to undermine financial stability in the future, as well as on the effects of sustained accommodative monetary policy on domestic asset markets.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.",
        "All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.",
        "Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "to rebound from the severe contraction, but the pace of recovery has somewhat slowed due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).",
        "In global financial markets, stock prices in major countries have risen amid continuing hopes for economic recovery, while the US dollar has weakened and government bond yields have moved up slightly.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses.",
        "exports has moderated a bit, the improvement in private consumption has weakened.",
        "The recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, and the correction in construction investment has continued.",
        "Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply.",
        "Looking forward, the recovery of domestic economic growth is likely to be slower than previously forecast, largely due to the domestic resurgence of COVID-19.",
        "In the Board’s central projection, GDP growth falls to slightly below -1% this year, considerably lower than the May forecast of -0.2%.",
        "Uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high.",
        "increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products and to a reduced decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased to the mid-0% level, and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to the upper-1% range.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the mid-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "volatility in global financial markets.",
        "The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range.",
        "Stock prices rose sharply but then reversed some of the earlier gains, mainly due to concerns about the coronavirus resurgence since mid-August.",
        "The rate of household loan growth has risen, and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country.",
        "economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the coronavirus resurgence and its impact on the economy and financial markets, changes in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.",
        "After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International Finance_ members covered the following areas: Members assessed that, looking at the global economy, economic growth had continued to slow and world trade had remained sluggish.",
        "Members evaluated that, despite some improvement in the US-China trade dispute, uncertainties surrounding the growth path remained high due to ongoing geopolitical risks.",
        "Meanwhile, members pointed out that, although international financial markets remained stable overall despite external potential risks, attention should be paid to the possibility of greater volatility.",
        "As for the domestic economy, members diagnosed that exports and investment had been gradually showing positive signs and the sluggishness of private consumption had been easing.",
        "Members also expected conditions in the semiconductor industry to improve with the completion of semiconductor price adjustments.",
        "Meanwhile, some members pointed out that the forecasts for export-oriented industries other than the semiconductor sector remained uncertain, and expressed concerns that domestic economic growth could fall substantially below the potential growth path.",
        "With regard to prices, members forecast that consumer price inflation would rise further for some time, boosted by the easing of supply-side downward inflation pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, some members evaluated that there was little chance of the gradual decline in underlying inflation reversing to an increase this year, due to external and domestic uncertainties surrounding the Korean economy.",
        "Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members’ evaluation was that overall financial conditions had shown a higher degree of easing on the back of faster growth in private sector credit and market liquidity.",
        "However, given housing price hikes in the Seoul metropolitan region and the acceleration of household debt growth, members pointed to the need to pay attention to the possibility of the accumulation of financial imbalances, in order to ensure financial stability.",
        "Meanwhile, some members assessed that the recent surge in real estate prices had been limited to specific regions and specific types of housing such as newly-built apartments, and expressed the view that further discussions were needed on appropriate policy measures.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25%, while two members called for lowering it by 25 basis points.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "Looking at the domestic and overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member evaluated that global economic growth was estimated to have continued to slow at a modest pace, but conditions related to future economic trends were improving gradually.",
        "The member mentioned that trade uncertainty had partly eased with the conclusion of the phase one trade agreement between the US and China and that a growing number of countries had been operating more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "The member also assessed that, as investor sentiment had been picking up in the financial markets, there was an increasing likelihood of a virtuous circle in which improvement in economic sentiment boosts the real economy and vice versa.",
        "More specifically, the member noted that some indicators for the manufacturing sector, which had suffered the brunt of the decline in the growth rate over the last couple of years, had been showing signs of improvement, particularly in Asian emerging economies, and there was a need to watch with keen interest whether this improvement was sustainable.",
        "However, the member stressed that, as seen in the escalation of the tensions between the US and Iran, the global economy was exposed to various geopolitical risks and the possibility of a reemergence of trade disputes could not be ruled out, and went on to argue that a careful approach was still required in judging the future growth path.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was that the sluggishness of the domestic economy caused by cyclical factors had been somewhat easing, on the back of improvement in global economic conditions and the strengthening of the expansionary macroeconomic policy stance.",
        "The member evaluated that, although the average capacity utilization ratio of the manufacturing sector had shown a quarter-on-quarter decrease in the fourth quarter of which are demand-side conditions, had been improving when irregular factors are controlled.",
        "However, the member pointed out that the private sector would likely show only a limited recovery in the future compared with those seen during past business cycles, given that the correction phase in the construction sector could be prolonged by the strengthening of regulations and that uncertainties existed due to changes in various microeconomic policies concerning the labor market.",
        "The member stated that consumer price inflation had increased in December 2019 as in the month before, in line with the easing of supply-side downward inflation pressures, and forecast that inflation would tick up further for some time, considering the recent price trends of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and petroleum products.",
        "Meanwhile, the member evaluated that financial conditions had become looser, as risk-off sentiment had eased in the financial markets and market liquidity had exhibited faster growth, led chiefly by credit to the corporate sector.",
        "The member pointed out that this could be interpreted as the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission channels in the financial markets, but it could at the same time suggest a growing need to keep a close eye on possible accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "The member stressed that it should be noted that, while exhibiting a high household debt-to-GDP ratio, Korea had not experienced significant deleveraging, unlike major advanced countries, and real estate-related exposures accounted for a large share of private sector credit in Korea.",
        "The member set out the view that, in overall consideration of the above-mentioned points, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the present meeting.",
        "Another member stated that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to The member’s evaluation was that the global and domestic economic environments and domestic economic trends had not changed much since the November meeting.",
        "First, the member noted that, although the US-China trade dispute was less likely to deteriorate further, the Iran issue had emerged as a new geopolitical risk and it was therefore difficult to say that positive progress had been made in the global trade environment.",
        "The member added that, more fundamentally, there had been a continued underlying trend of changes to global value chains.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, the member judged that the consumption and investment trends had not departed from the November forecasts.",
        "The member projected that, because there were no changes that would require a significant revision of the November forecasts, economic growth this year would fall substantially below potential growth as it had last year and the negative output gap was likely to be the largest since the period of 2012 to 2013.",
        "With regard to inflation as well, the member forecast that, since no new shocks had emerged since the previous economic outlook, consumer price inflation would fluctuate due to one-off factors, with core inflation in the mid- and upper-0% range acting as an underlying trend.",
        "The member mentioned in this regard that it would be difficult to say that the real interest rate suggested by the current Base Rate was lower than the real neutral interest rate, and in light of this, the previous assessment that current monetary policy was not fully accommodative remained valid.",
        "In this regard, the member judged that it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 1.00%.",
        "The member noted that, if there could be any controversy concerning the appropriateness of this interest rate policy judgment, it would be about financial stability, and more specifically an assessment of household debt and housing prices, rather than about economic and inflation trends.",
        "The member went on to state that monetary policy implementation at this point in time could be freer than in the past from financial stability considerations.",
        "First, looking at household debt, the member assessed that the household debt growth rate, estimated at the lower-4% level last year, had stabilized.",
        "The member pointed out that a further curbing of household debt growth could delay a rebound of the economy and inflation, adding to the burdens of debt relative to nominal income.",
        "The member took the view that, if debt growth needed to be further curbed nevertheless, macroprudential measures should be used, considering leasehold deposit loans had been leading household debt growth over the last two years.",
        "The member added that growth in leasehold deposit loans, which are guaranteed loans, seemed to have been boosted by the increased guarantees provided by guarantee institutions seeking housing stability for the general public, and in this regard, curbing household debt would require policy instruments aiming at adjusting the degree of growth in leasehold deposit loans.",
        "Next, the member presented the view that the judgment mentioned earlier still seemed proper even when looking at the relationship between housing prices and current monetary policy operations.",
        "The member stated that continued attention should be paid to housing price surges, given that, if housing price movements were related with household debt, household debt growth and housing price hikes could create synergy effects, leading to excessive debt growth, excessive housing price hikes, and ultimately, to an outbreak of a crisis.",
        "The member went on to point out, however, that the recent housing market movements had not been serious enough to raise concerns in terms of monetary policy.",
        "The member noted that, more specifically, the housing price growth rate based on the Housing Price Index had stood at 1.1% in 2018 and –0.4% in 2019, and housing prices outside of the Seoul metropolitan area in particular had continued to fall for the second consecutive year, suggesting that an overall housing price surge related to liquidity conditions was not materializing.",
        "The member also explained that, although the rate of growth in the average Seoul apartment sales price and the rate of growth in apartment sales prices felt by the general public had been in double digits, this seemed related with old houses being recently replaced with new apartments reconstructed or redeveloped in Seoul.",
        "The member assessed that what was particular about the recent housing market trend was not a surge of general house prices boosted by excessive liquidity but distinct fluctuations in the relative prices of assets, led mainly by supply and demand of specific types of housing, and went on to argue that this should be addressed with housing policy or local policy measures, rather than monetary policy.",
        "In sum, the member presented the view that, since the related authorities had been announcing and implementing decisive measures against household debt and the hike in average Seoul apartment sales prices, the operation of monetary policy with a focus on economic activities and inflation would contribute to an appropriate division of policies.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member’s judgment was that the recent domestic economic situation had remained sluggish overall, but had been showing partial improvements.",
        "The member evaluated that the improvements in US-China trade relations and the semiconductor industry, which had served as major negative factors affecting Korea’s exports and facilities, were helping to ease the sluggishness in exports, facilities investment, and even private consumption.",
        "As to inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation had been rising gradually since October 2019 and forecast it to reach the forecast in November last year.",
        "The member also expected that, despite a variety of latent domestic and overseas risk factors, the domestic economy would be positively affected by improvements in the external conditions, such as the phase one trade deal between the US and China and the outlook for the recovery of the semiconductor industry, as well as by the government’s aggressive fiscal policy stance.",
        "The member mentioned that, in reflection of these changes in domestic and external conditions, stock prices had risen and the won-dollar exchange rate had declined in the domestic financial markets.",
        "The member also assessed overall financial conditions as substantially accommodative, with private sector credit and market liquidity showing faster growth.",
        "With regard to household lending, the member noted that the pace of growth in household loans, particularly those related to housing, had accelerated further in line with housing price hikes.",
        "The member expected household lending growth to slow gradually, considering that housing price growth had been slowing somewhat since the government’s announcement of housing market stabilization measures on December 16, 2019.",
        "However, the member expressed the view that, as the general public continued to expect housing prices to rise further amid very loose financial conditions in general and there were concerns about a possible balloon effect that would raise housing prices in non-regulated areas, continued attention should be paid to household loans from the financial stability perspective.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that, according to briefings by staff on the effects of two Base Rate cuts last year, the rate cuts had been smoothly spreading to the financial markets through declines in deposit and lending rates and growth in credit to the private sector.",
        "The member expected that the real economy would also see positive effects of the rate cuts gradually, through the easing of the interest rate burdens of both households and corporations and improvement in economic sentiment.",
        "However, the member stressed the need to pay attention to the possibility of Base Rate cuts acting as a factor easing financial conditions, consequently contributing to credit growth and asset price hikes.",
        "In conclusion, considering that downside risks to the macroeconomy had been decreasing somewhat owing to signs of improvement in some domestic and external conditions, the positive effects of the Base Rate cuts and fiscal expenditure expansion, and improvement in economic sentiment, and that attention should be continuously paid to financial stability matters as private debt growth had been accelerating along with expectations of housing price hikes, the member presented the view that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current The member evaluated that, looking at global economic conditions, trends of economic growth in major countries excluding the US had slowed, and world trade had also remained sluggish.",
        "The member noted that, on the domestic economic front, the negative output gap had widened due to last year’s slower growth while prices remained low.",
        "The member, however, judged that private consumption was showing partial improvements and indicators related to economic activities were also showing positive signs that there would be no further economic decline during this year.",
        "The member saw that there were growing expectations that the slowdowns in exports and facilities investment would ease somewhat in line for instance with expectations of improvement in the semiconductor industry and progress in the US-China trade negotiations.",
        "The member, however, assessed that it was still too early to have confidence that this would lead to a trend of full-fledged improvement.",
        "The member noted that there were uncertainties surrounding the global economy including geopolitical risks, and on the domestic front, it was difficult to easily reverse the current situation of the weakened competitiveness of the manufacturing sector leading to worsened economic sentiment amid a slowdown in the construction industry.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that attention should be paid to these points.",
        "The member pointed out that, although the international financial markets remained stable overall despite the US-Iran conflict, there still was a possibility of increased volatility.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for constant monitoring to prevent external potential risk factors from causing domestic financial market instability.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, since monetary policy usually had impacts after a time lag of four to six quarters, the monetary policy direction should be made based on the forecasts for economic activity and price conditions after one to one-and-a-half years.",
        "The member thus noted the need for in-depth reviews and analyses of the probability of the BOK’s forecasts being realized.",
        "The member particularly noted that if the expectations channel, among all monetary policy transmission channels, was operated in linkage with financial stability issues, rather than the real sector, only negative side effects of accommodative monetary policy could emerge.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to pay attention to this.",
        "In this regard, the member noted the need to thoroughly examine the possibility whether the sustained low interest policy would actually work to increase the flow of funds into the real estate sector or be used as a tool to prolong the lives of marginal firms, instead of leading to improvements in the real economy.",
        "Meanwhile, from the perspective of financial stability, the member noted that household debt growth had slowed considerably until the first half of last year, thanks for instance to the effects of real estate measures.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the scale of household debt growth had been expanding since the second half of last year, as real estate prices in some regions continued to rise substantially.",
        "The member presented the view that household debt growth in association with the trend of rising real estate prices was affected not only by real estate-related policy, but also by expectations about accommodative monetary policy to some extent.",
        "In summary, the member saw that, while the accommodative monetary stance should be sustained for now in consideration of real economic conditions, such as the growth rate and prices, more attention should be paid to financial stability issues as well.",
        "The member emphasized that, particularly since various indicators were showing that there was ample liquidity in domestic financial markets, policy efforts to induce capital flows into productive sectors had become more important.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member forecast domestic economic growth to return to the level of potential growth, with the negative base effects of IT-related exports and investment disappearing and the adjustment in construction investment becoming smaller.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that attention should be paid to the point that the potential growth rate had been declining due to a slow shift toward new industries and high value-added service industries and due to remaining structural problems amid sluggishness in some manufacturing industries.",
        "The member judged prices to have shifted to a trend of recovery, albeit a weak one, as growth had bottomed out.",
        "The member, however, found it necessary to closely watch domestic demand pressures since the economic fundamentals of the domestic economy were weakening and there were uncertainties surrounding the forecast for exports, a major growth engine.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was desirable to maintain the current accommodative macroeconomic policy stance.",
        "The member, however, noted that a few points should be considered when adjusting the monetary policy stance in the future.",
        "First, the member noted that responding to sluggish domestic demand triggered by weaker potential growth with a stronger easing stance alone, without structural reform, would lead to weaker regenerative capacities of the markets through a possible delay in the restructuring of distressed companies.",
        "The member added that in this case, consumer spending capacity would be undermined in the medium term, since investment and consumption would not lead to productive capital expansion and the debt burden would increase instead.",
        "The member thus noted that it was necessary to remain alert in this regard.",
        "Second, the member’s assessment was that, while the growth gap was narrowing, macroeconomic policy would expand further overall this year given the government’s fiscal policy stance, even if the Base Rate remained at the current level.",
        "The member thus pointed out the need to consider carefully if this policy stance was the most effective way to use policy space.",
        "Third, the member stressed the need to carry out inflation targeting from a medium-term perspective, within a range that does not allow inflation expectations to be significantly de-anchored from the target, because excessive counter-cyclical actions to deal with the trend of decline in prices could end up re-igniting financial imbalances only.",
        "Fourth, the member’s assessment was that monetary policy in Korea had differed from those in advanced economies in terms of method and size since the financial crisis up until now, but it had similar achievements in terms of effectiveness as it had been conducted in line with the economic issues Korea was facing.",
        "The member noted that, in other words, the impacts of monetary policy in Korea on the financial markets were similar to those in major advanced economies in terms of decreased lending rates and expanded leverage.",
        "The member explained that, looking how the real economy―the ultimate goal―was impacted by such financial market changes, Korea did not differ greatly from major advanced economies in terms of indicators such as the cumulative inflation gap and GDP volatility.",
        "The member added, however, that major advanced economies had maintained interest rates lower than Korea over a long period of time, in consideration of the need for deleveraging and the contribution of fiscal policy.",
        "The member noted that this had worked to prevent the spread of a financial crisis, but had also brought about a decline in the growth rate, due to inefficient resource allocation, and to growth in debt interlinked with excessive expansion in financial assets.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although Korea’s starting point differed from those of advanced economies, attention should still be paid to the implications of the domestic debt buildup, of the widening gap between returns on investment related to real estate excluding arbitrage and marginal productivity of other capital, and of growth in marginal firms.",
        "The member’s judgment was that, given these points, it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it was desirable to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 1.00%.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had shown weak growth last year dependent upon active fiscal expansion, while exports and investment had decreased significantly.",
        "The member estimated that, as a result, even though real GDP growth would likely have been close to 2%, nominal GDP growth would have been at around 1%, the lowest since the 1998 currency crisis.",
        "The member’s assessment was that this steep economic decline had been easing somewhat since the fourth quarter of last year, thanks to reduced uncertainties related to the US-China trade dispute, and to eased monetary policy at home and abroad.",
        "The member also noted that another positive factor was that semiconductor price adjustments that had been underway were being completed.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the outlook for a number of other export industries was still unclear and overall domestic demand including construction investment was still sluggish.",
        "The member saw that the government’s expansionary fiscal policy was likely to offset the slower growth rate this year as well, but the negative output gap was unlikely to be narrowed, with the growth rate failing to reach the potential growth rate, which was estimated in the mid-2% range.",
        "The member forecast that, even if nominal GDP growth rebounded due to technical factors, it would be very difficult for the nominal rate to reach around 4%, the level that could be seen as consistent with potential growth and modest inflation.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, accordingly, it would not be easy to expect a reversal from the trend of gradual decline in underlying price inflation which had been ongoing for several years.",
        "The member pointed out that a further deceleration of core inflation, which had deviated from the expectations, and consequently even a relatively minor shock could raise concerns of deflation.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was desirable to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 1.00% and conduct monetary policy with a focus on supporting the economic recovery and reducing the risk of a continued decline in underlying inflation.",
        "The member noted that, looking at the current domestic economic growth rate and price inflation from an international perspective, the 1% Base Rate was not assessed to be excessively low.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that it was necessary to have in-depth discussions about the extent to which monetary policy, whose effects are nationwide and indiscriminative in nature, should account for the surge in new and reconstructed apartment prices in Seoul, which seemed to be attributable mainly to supply constraints.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho, Dongchul and Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "economic growth has continued to slow with the ongoing sluggishness in trade.",
        "The global financial markets have been generally stable in line mainly with progress in the US-China trade negotiations, while recently volatility temporarily increased due to the escalation of military tensions in the Middle East.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by developments in global trade protectionism and geopolitical risks.",
        "Facilities investment has slightly increased and consumption growth has expanded, although construction investment and exports have continued to decline.",
        "Employment conditions have continued to improve in some respects, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen.",
        "GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, consistent overall with the level projected in November.",
        "Although the adjustment in construction investment will continue, the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment will gradually ease and the consumption growth rate will moderately rise.",
        "in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to increases in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the upper-1% level.",
        "Looking ahead, it is forecast that during this year consumer price inflation will rise to around 1%, generally in accord with the path projected in November, and core inflation will run at the upper-0% level.",
        "exchange rate has fallen, affected chiefly by movements in the global financial markets and expectations of a recovery in the semiconductor industry.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have rebounded from an earlier decline.",
        "The amount of increase in household lending has expanded, and housing prices have shown high rates of increase in Seoul and its surrounding areas especially.",
        "economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while carefully monitoring developments in global trade disputes, the economies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks and examining their effects on domestic macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.",
        "After briefings by staff on Recent Economic Developments,[2)] FX and International Finance Trends, and Financial Market Trends, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Looking at the global economy, members assessed that due to the continued worldwide spread of COVID-19, economic activity had contracted significantly and a global economic downturn was materializing, particularly in major advanced economies.",
        "Members saw that the international financial markets continued to show instability, with volatility in price variables remaining high, although risk aversion had eased somewhat, thanks to active policy responses of individual countries.",
        "Members pointed out that, due to the influence of COVID-19, private consumption had declined significantly and difficulties in the service sector were increasing, led by the accommodation & food service sector and leisure-related industries.",
        "Members diagnosed that a continued slowdown in the production of corporations have been causing a delay in facilities investment, and a contraction in exports would be unavoidable.",
        "Members emphasized that it should be kept in mind that if the spread of COVID-19 continued for a prolonged period of time, thus causing a sharp decline in the sales of domestic corporations, financial unrest could intensify and real economic resilience could be undermined.",
        "With regard to prices, members assessed that consumer price inflation had slowed again after rebounding early this year, similar to the movement seen in core inflation.",
        "Members saw that, going forward, downside risks to prices would increase further, due to a plunge in international oil prices and the effects from the government’s measures to stabilize people’s livelihoods.",
        "Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members’ evaluation was that price variables had become much more volatile, influenced by the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and heightened volatility in the international financial markets, while the corporate bond market in particular remained highly averse to credit risk.",
        "Members noted that market unrest had recently eased somewhat, thanks to active response measures by the government and the BOK.",
        "Members, however, emphasized that monitoring of vulnerable sectors should be strengthened further, since there were high uncertainties related to the future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.75%, while two members called for lowering it by 25 basis points.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.75%.",
        "The member evaluated that financial market unrest, stemming from the influence of a financial shock originating in the US and from a contraction in domestic consumption, was easing to some extent, thanks to a series of policy measures by the government and the BOK.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current meeting and closely watch the effects of the recent 50 basis point Base Rate cut and of the government’s mix of various policies.",
        "The member emphasized the need to prepare for a possible sharp expansion of a shock originating in the real economy whereby worsened global trade leads to a drop in the sales of domestic corporations.",
        "Looking at the domestic financial markets, the member’s assessment was that uncertainties had eased and liquidity had been kept at an appropriate level.",
        "The member added that risk-based differentiation was properly taking place overall, and the credit channel had been operating without any serious crunch.",
        "The member, however, presented the opinion that, since the world economy could contract significantly until the second half of this year, additional response measures were needed.",
        "The member noted that, if corporate sales declined steeply due to sluggish exports, financial unrest could expand greatly.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for the BOK to prepare response measures.",
        "The member, however, saw that, unlike during the global financial crisis period, the current shock had emerged in the real economy and thus it could be difficult to distinguish liquidity risks from solvency risks.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that the government should provide guarantees for solvency risks in advance to allow the central bank to preemptively respond.",
        "The member noted that, if the contraction in economic activity was expected to spread more deeply to the entire economy despite various measures by the policy authorities, the policy rate should be reduced to the lower bound to minimize the debt burden across the entire economy and to provide funds as needed.",
        "Finally, the member emphasized that the best policy to achieve the inflation target under the current economic conditions was to minimize production capacity losses.",
        "The member added that, to this end, every effort should be made to prevent permanent losses in labor and production capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and consideration should also be given to the exit strategy based on the experience of advanced economies.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 0.75% level at the current meeting.",
        "The member noted that the continued worldwide spread of COVID-19 had significantly weakened economic activity and severely affected financial conditions.",
        "The member saw that risk aversion in the financial markets had eased somewhat, thanks to recent active policy responses by individual countries, but the shock to the real economy was increasing further, due to the implementation of strong quarantine measures, such as lockdowns or business suspensions in major countries, including the US.",
        "Considering the proportion in the world economy of these countries, the member saw that the global economy was highly likely to have already entered a downturn phase, and anxiety among economic agents could continue for a considerable time.",
        "The member thus judged uncertainties surrounding the medium- to long-term growth path to be very high.",
        "The member noted that, on the domestic economic front, service and manufacturing production had decreased sharply in February, and domestic demand, such as consumption and investment, had also contracted.",
        "The member saw that, although exports had shown a relatively gentle correction, this was mainly due to a time lag between export orders and shipments.",
        "The member went on to expect that the negative impacts on global trade and domestic exports would be amplified greatly in the second quarter, given that major economies had seen simultaneous downturns since early March.",
        "Accordingly, the member forecast that economic growth for this year would run well below the February forecast and the inflation gap would widen more than expected.",
        "The member noted that, in the domestic financial markets, the rapid simultaneous weakening of stock prices, interest rates and exchange rates had eased thanks to various market stabilization measures, but credit risk aversion in the capital markets continued to be heightened, with CP rates rising greatly and credit spreads of corporate bonds widening amid a contraction in funding conditions of the non-banking sector.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to the indirect financial markets which accounted for a large share of domestic corporate financing, the member assessed that credit was being supplied smoothly, with bank lending rates falling and interest spreads for lending remaining stable.",
        "The member noted that this market pattern differed somewhat from what was seen in the US and other major advanced economies.",
        "The member, however, commented that prolonged real economic sluggishness at home and abroad would increase the debt-servicing risk of corporations, thus leading to worsened asset soundness in the banking sector, and such a risk could even evolve into systemic risk, depending on the situation.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to pay attention to this issue.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the main worry at this point was that it still remained uncertain when the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic would slow significantly.",
        "The member expressed concern that, if the COVID-19 situation continued for a prolonged period of time, and the consequent contraction in demand at home and abroad lasted even after the first half of this year, deterioration in corporate profits and cash flows would lead to employment and investment corrections, closures, and bankruptcies in major industries, thus severely harming the medium- to long-term growth potential.",
        "The member was also concerned that the possibility could not be ruled out that this would work to cause serious financial instability through a vicious cycle with financial conditions.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need to pursue comprehensive response measures to deal with various risk factors that could be triggered by a prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic, through close coordination with fiscal and financial policy measures, while carrying out monetary policy flexibly by preparing response measures for various scenarios.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that, given the large Base Rate cut at the interim Monetary Policy Board meeting in March and the implementation of several stabilization measures, it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current 0.75% at the current meeting and closely monitor changes in domestic and international economic and financial conditions, as well as the effects of policy responses so far.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current The member raised the concern that, although the Base Rate had been cut by 50 basis points at the March 16 interim meeting to deal with the worldwide spread of COVID-19 earlier in the month, it later became difficult to identify the severity of the relevant shock, due to a mix of a real economic crisis and a financial market crisis resulting from the accelerated spread of COVID-19.",
        "The member noted that, with major global institutions and investment banks adjusting their world economic growth outlooks for this year sharply downward, the real economy and financial markets in Korea would be inevitably hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The member thus judged that there were large downside risks to the BOK’s forecasts for economic growth and consumer price inflation.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member’s evaluation was that private consumption had already been declining significantly, and difficulties in service industries, such as the accommodation that a slowdown in the production of domestic corporations was continuing in the manufacturing sector, while sluggishness in facilities investment and a contraction in the export sector would be unavoidable.",
        "The member assessed that uncertainties in the international financial markets had heightened substantially, and in the domestic financial markets, stock prices had fallen sharply and difficulties had emerged in some short-term financial markets.",
        "The member emphasized that, since the credit spreads of corporate bonds had widened due to aversion to credit risk, it was necessary to closely monitor the relevant developments.",
        "The member noted that, given the continued spread of COVID-19 across the globe, preparations should be made to deal with a possible prolongation and deepening of difficulties in several industries, including the airline industry.",
        "The member saw that, if the worldwide spread of COVID-19 slowed and economic activity started to normalize, a rebound in the real economy and stability in the financial markets would be expected, but it would be difficult to expect a rapid recovery at an early stage.",
        "The member judged that it was important to carry out an active monetary policy in the current crisis situation, but for now it was also necessary to observe for a little while longer the effects of the measures taken so far.",
        "The member thus expressed the opinion that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current level at this meeting and closely monitor real economic conditions and financial market trends in the future.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, since the recent credit crunch in some financial markets looked to be a liquidity supply issue, rather than an interest level issue, responses were urgently required.",
        "The member also added that, given that the Base Rate was already approaching the effective lower bound, preparations to use non-traditional monetary policy tools should be made without delay.",
        "Finally, the member emphasized that, since difficulties in the real economy and the financial markets were expected for a considerable time, the BOK should continue to play an active role in preventing financial market unrest from spreading, by ensuring proper functioning of financial intermediation, while maintaining stability in the foreign exchange markets.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it was appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the current 0.75% to 0.50%.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, economic activities had contracted drastically and financial market volatility had increased significantly, and there was high uncertainty as to the future trajectory of the pandemic.",
        "The member mentioned that, if the current situation continued longer than expected, the resilience of the real economy could be undermined and Korea’s already low underlying inflation could decline even further, raising concerns about deflation risk.",
        "The member argued that the current situation in this regard required aggressive measures by the monetary and fiscal authorities and that monetary policy, which is more flexible than fiscal policy, should be operated in a more prompt manner to cope with the emergency.",
        "The member noted that, given that the central bank’s monetary policy is aimed at seeking stability of the market as a whole, rather than supporting troubled financial institutions or businesses on an individual basis, a rate cut would be the necessary policy measure under the current situation to stimulate the economy comprehensively and expand the supply of liquidity.",
        "The member evaluated that, unlike most advanced countries whose policy rates had been already lowered to the that a Base Rate cut would reduce incentives for massive liquidity, currently remaining within the banking sector due to investors’ excessive risk aversion and strong preference for cash, to flow back to the BOK, serving as a starting point to ease the credit crunch in the financial markets and help the impacts of monetary policy spread to the real economy.",
        "The member added that sufficient Base Rate cuts were a precondition for quantitative easing policy.",
        "The member mentioned that, given the recent uncertain economic conditions, it was important to prepare for a situation where credit market instability undermines effective monetary policy transmission and triggers financial market unrest.",
        "In this regard, the member expressed the view that it would be desirable to expand the central bank’s recent decision to buy short-term bonds in repo auctions in an unlimited amount.",
        "The member also pointed to the need to positively consider buying prime corporate bonds and CP to prepare against the possibility of an excessive financial market crunch due to the real economic slump.",
        "In this case, however, the member argued that applying relevant credit spreads is essential in order to prevent moral hazard and minimize the risk of losses by the note-issuing authority, and to this end, the government’s cooperation and the National Assembly’s approval were important when the BOK took on credit risks.",
        "Finally, the member took the view that the BOK’s loans to for-profit businesses should be limited to exceptional cases based on the MPB’s judgment that the crisis faced by these businesses was not a solvency crisis but rather a temporary liquidity crisis, which would not be resolved for the entire financial markets as well as for the businesses concerned unless lending occurred.",
        "The member added that the MPB does not appear authorized to determine whether to support specific for-profit businesses with uncertain medium- to long-term debt servicing capacities.",
        "Considering the above-mentioned matters, the member argued that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate to 0.50% this time.",
        "The member added that in the event of a further economic slump the logically consistent policy mix would be, in order: further reducing the Base Rate, ensuring market interest rate stability through government bond purchases, and buying corporate bonds.",
        "Another member stated that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of The member assessed that, with the recent global spread of COVID-19, a global economic slump was becoming apparent, particularly in major advanced countries.",
        "The member noted that, although countries were strengthening their disease-control efforts and taking strong economic stimulus measures in terms of fiscal, monetary and financial policies, the potential economic recession was said to be more serious than during the global financial crisis.",
        "The member forecast that domestic economic growth would be dampened significantly by COVID-19, with production and retail sales declining and facilities investment delayed.",
        "The member however expressed the view that, considering that the number of confirmed cases in Korea had been growing at a slower pace recently and that the services sector, hit hard by the virus outbreak, accounted for a smaller part of the domestic economy than in major advanced countries, the economic slump would be less serious in Korea than in other countries.",
        "The member nonetheless expressed concerns that a prolongation of major countries’ economic slumps could affect Korea significantly, considering the high uncertainty about the future trajectory of the virus outbreak and Korea’s high dependence on external trade.",
        "As to inflation, meanwhile, the member forecast that downward inflation pressures would increase further, due to sluggish demand, international oil price declines and the effects of the government measures to promote the stability of people’s livelihoods.",
        "The member noted that, in the domestic and overseas financial markets, the volatility of price variables had increased significantly owing to the virus outbreak, while risk-off sentiment had strengthened in line with heightened credit risk aversion.",
        "The member added that, although market instability had been somewhat easing recently, substantial risk factors remained, particularly in the credit markets.",
        "The member mentioned that, considering these growth, inflation and financial conditions, it would be necessary to expand the degree of monetary easing in order to reduce downside risks to the macroeconomy and promote financial market stability.",
        "The member added however that the BOK had lowered the Base Rate by 50 basis points to a record low level of 0.75% at the interim meeting in March and following this had been providing a massive amount of liquidity by conducting repo auctions to supply an unlimited amount of liquidity at set interest rates.",
        "The member added that it should be taken into consideration that the current level of the Base Rate left only limited room for further rate cuts.",
        "The member expressed the view that, in this regard, it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period and monitor the ripple effects of the various fiscal, monetary and financial policy measures implemented so far, and to carefully consider the timing of an additional rate cut to maximize its effectiveness.",
        "The member emphasized, however, that the central bank should consider all possible monetary policy tools and seek appropriate measures within the range of authority delegated to it, if needed to ensure stability of the macroeconomy and financial system in line with future changes in domestic and external conditions.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward by 25 basis points to 0.50%.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the global economy was on an unprecedented path, as COVID-19 had recently worsened to become a global pandemic.",
        "The member evaluated that the domestic economy was affected significantly through two channels: shrinking domestic demand resulting from social distancing, and the negative shock from the de facto suspension of economic activity in major advanced countries.",
        "The member stated that it was the first time in the history of the market economy for a natural disaster to have an impact on countries around the globe all at the same time, and went on to express concerns about the high uncertainties regarding the depth of the shock and future path of the global economy.",
        "The member noted that two main scenarios could be mapped out concerning the future path of the domestic economy: a positive scenario in which the spread of the virus was contained not only in Korea but also in major advanced countries from the second quarter, and the global economy consequently rebounded rapidly in the second half of the year; and a scenario in which the spread of the virus was not curbed as soon as originally expected, causing an increase in the cost of coping with the crisis, leading to a structural weakening of major economies and pulling down the potential global economic growth rate.",
        "The member evaluated that it would be proper to expect the global economy to rebound from the second half of the year, given that natural disasters had usually developed in line with the positive scenario.",
        "The member however expressed concerns that the possibility of the second scenario could not be ruled out, considering that the current virus outbreak affected the whole world and advanced countries in particular, and that it was the first virus pandemic.",
        "The member in this regard emphasized that, in addition to normal monetary policy responses in pursuit of price and macroeconomic stability, the central bank should also draw up response plans for crisis management to keep the financial system functioning in case of emergency.",
        "The member expected that, looking at the real economy prior to determining the direction of monetary policy, the domestic economy would exhibit much slower growth of 0% at the highest this year, even under the positive scenario forecasting a rebound in the second half.",
        "The member stated that Korea’s output gap had been substantially negative last year due to the sluggishness of global trade, and went on to forecast that this year the domestic economy would see the largest negative output gap since 2000.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, considering the domestic economic growth trend, from a historical perspective the current real economic sluggishness could be seen as an economic crisis, and expressed concerns that aggregate demand might show an unusual decrease and a substantial number of businesses and small business owners might be exposed to a liquidity crisis owing to a drastic sales plunge.",
        "Looking at inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation had rebounded in January this year and then had been slowing again, and expected that both annual consumer price inflation and core inflation would be unlikely to exceed the lower-0% level, with the output gap forecast to be substantially negative this year.",
        "The member pointed out that the problem was that core inflation would continue to decline for a long period of time and that inflation expectations were highly likely to decline accordingly this year.",
        "The member mentioned that past declines in inflation had been mainly attributable to goods prices while service charges had shown relatively modest decreases, but this year service charges had been leading the decline in inflation.",
        "In this regard, the member expressed concerns that the fall in service charges, which was closely related with the livelihood of economic agents, could act as a larger shock causing inflation expectations to decline.",
        "The member added that if an economic emergency led to a wage decrease, there was no small likelihood of downward wage rigidity weakening and the inflation trend entering a new phase.",
        "In summary, the member stated that there was a risk of a temporary liquidity crisis due to an excessive economic slump and, in terms of inflation, there were concerns about inflation expectations declining and the inflation trend entering a new phase, and went on to argue that it would be appropriate in this regard to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho and Dr. Shin expressed clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at the current level of 0.75% and argued for cutting it by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period.",
        "contracted significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Volatility in global financial markets has increased sharply.",
        "Stock prices in major countries have fallen considerably while government bond yields and exchange rates have fluctuated widely, due to concerns of a recession and the sharp drop in global oil prices.",
        "Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pathway of the pandemic, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.",
        "decreased substantially and the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued.",
        "The correction in construction investment has continued while exports have declined slightly.",
        "As for employment, the number of persons employed had continued to rise at a high rate until February, but the number of persons on temporary leave has increased due to the contraction in economic activity.",
        "GDP growth is projected to fall considerably below the February forecast of 2.1%, and uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high.",
        "Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved down slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the upper-1% level.",
        "It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run considerably below the February projection (1.0% and inflationary pressure.",
        "COVID-19 and heightened volatility in global financial markets.",
        "The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose steeply but then decreased after the establishment of a currency swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated around the lower-1% level.",
        "The rate of household loan growth has risen, while the rate of increase in housing prices has moderated since mid-March.",
        "economic growth is sustained and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "In view of the mounting economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will conduct monetary policy in an accommodative manner in order to mitigate downside risks to the economy and ease volatility in financial markets.",
        "In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while thoroughly assessing the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, its impact on the domestic economy and financial markets, and changes in financial stability."

    "2018": [
        "After briefings by staff on “Economic Outlooks for 2018 and 2019,” discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, despite slowdowns of economic growth in Japan and China, the global economy had continued to show strong growth, led by the strength of the US economy.",
        "Members also mentioned that the volatility of price variables, such as stock prices and exchange and interest rates, had increased significantly in the global financial markets, affected chiefly by the escalating trade tensions between the US and China and concerns about US policy rate hikes.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that facilities and construction investment had continued to go through corrections, exports had remained buoyant, and consumption had maintained modest growth.",
        "Members also mentioned that the growth forecasts for this year and next had been adjusted downward to 2.7 percent, in reflection mainly of the faster paces of correction in facilities and construction investment and the negative impacts of the US-China trade conflict on Korea’s exports.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had accelerated to 1.9 percent in September, boosted largely by increases in international oil and agricultural product prices, while core inflation had remained at 1.0 percent with declines in administered prices having continued effects.",
        "Members mentioned that the CPI growth forecast for this year had remained at 1.6 percent, while that for next year had been adjusted downward from 1.9 percent to 1.7 percent.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that the escalating US-China trade tensions and concerns about the US Fed’s rate hikes had caused stock prices to fall significantly and the Korean won to depreciate greatly, and volatility had increased due to temporary outflows of foreign securities investment in October.",
        "Members also mentioned that household debt was expected to stabilize, thanks for example to government measures, but its growth had continued to outpace that of household income, while sole proprietor loans had also maintained strong growth, all of which required constant attention.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, while two members called for a 0.25 percentage point hike.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.",
        "The member evaluated that, with the buoyancy of the US economy, the global economy had continued to show favorable growth on the whole, and forecast global trade to maintain favorable growth.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member noted that exports had remained strong and private consumption had shown modest growth, while investment had remained sluggish and employment had continued to worsen.",
        "The member mentioned that the government measures to stimulate the economy and strengthen the income base were expected to have positive effects on private consumption, but there also existed factors holding it back, such as sluggish employment.",
        "The member also noted the ongoing corrections in facilities investment, which had shown a sharp increase last year in the semiconductor sector in particular, and in construction investment, which had remained buoyant for the past several years.",
        "The member evaluated that exports had declined, due mainly to the decrease in the number of working days during September and also to a base effect, but remained favorable overall, with the daily average export value hitting a record high.",
        "The member noted that employment had been better than anticipated last month, but significant improvement seemed unlikely next year as well.",
        "The member noted that, taking all this into consideration, the Bank of Korea’s Research Department had made downward adjustments to the economic outlooks for this year and next as well as a significant adjustment to the employment outlook, and went on to argue that the growth rate might fall short of its potential, although only slightly, this year and next.",
        "The member forecast inflation, having increased significantly in September driven chiefly by oil price hikes, to nearly reach its target at around the end of this year or the beginning of next year.",
        "The member judged that demand-side inflation pressures had not yet been large, however, due to the lower-than-expected core inflation.",
        "Looking at the estimates of output and inflation gaps based on the discussion above, the member judged that the Bank of Korea would have to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance, but unlike advanced countries that had experienced massive deleveraging since the global financial crisis in 2008, Korea had seen steady household debt growth and thus financial stability was gaining even greater importance.",
        "The member mentioned that the past several years of low interest rates seemed to have contributed, to some extent, to household debt growth and housing price rises in some regions, and expressed the view that household debt should be considered when making monetary policy decisions since its growth had been outpacing that of household income.",
        "The member noted that, while there were concerns that a rate hike could add to the burden of vulnerable borrowers, the Bank of Korea should supplement the government’s efforts by carrying out stress tests to continually analyze vulnerable borrowers, and stressed that, although household debt was within a controllable range at the moment, a close eye should be kept on it so that it would not grow excessively, which would create a debt trap and make it difficult for the central bank to raise its policy rate.",
        "Lastly, considering Korea’s strong macroeconomic conditions as well as its economic fundamentals, such as the current account surplus and foreign reserves, the member mentioned that reversals of the policy and market rates between the US and Korea seemed unlikely to cause massive capital outflows immediately.",
        "The member added, however, that since some heavily indebted emerging market economies with weak economic conditions might remain unstable, and since concerns had been raised about China-related risks due mainly to the US-China trade conflict, a prolongation and widening of the rate inversion might add to market volatility, and it would be therefore necessary to closely monitor the consequent effects.",
        "In summary, the member judged that, given the facts that the growth rate was unlikely to deviate far from its potential level and that consumer price inflation was forecast to near its target, it would be appropriate to place a greater focus on financial stability and reduce the degree of monetary policy easing to some extent.",
        "In particular, the member expressed the view that slower growth and sluggish employment were seen to have resulted from structural factors, such as the weakened competitiveness of core industries, rather than from cyclical factors, which could not be sufficiently dealt with through monetary policy measures alone, and added that in this regard it would be necessary to make medium- and long-term efforts to increase the potential growth rate.",
        "Recalling the previous events when excessive credit had caused bubbles to form and burst, weakening the financial sector’s soundness and intermediary role and ultimately worsening the real economy to a great extent, the member stressed that it would be extremely important to ensure financial stability for stable growth, and expected that monetary policy would have signaling effects.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.",
        "The member assessed inflation as nearing its target over a medium-term horizon amid weak but sustained demand-side pressures, and expected that a slight reduction of the accommodative monetary policy stance was unlikely to weaken demand-side pressures enough to have a significant effect on inflation but could contribute to curbing the widening of financial imbalances somewhat.",
        "The member also argued that, at a time when demand-side pressures were forecast to support the economy thanks to the accommodative fiscal policy, it would be desirable to change the monetary policy stance for harmonious policy operation as well.",
        "The member judged that the economic growth rate for this year seemed to have declined somewhat rapidly due to the base effect from excessive construction investment over the past few years and the readjustment of IT-related facilities investment that had shown fast growth last year, but recorded growth was within the margin of error of the forecast path and at the level of the potential growth rate, which itself had remained on a downward path.",
        "In addition, the member anticipated a continuation of demand-side pressures, supporting inflation thanks mainly to a potential accommodative fiscal policy, while private consumption had been maintaining relatively strong growth.",
        "The member also expressed the view that the recent low inflation had been attributable mainly to the continued decline in administered prices and added that consumer price inflation with these administered prices counted out had been exceeding 2 percent since the beginning of this year, with sticky prices in particular being above target for the past few years.",
        "The member mentioned that survey-based inflation expectations and forecasts for consumer prices of goods and services of companies related directly to the real economy had remained within the 2 percent range.",
        "The member also expected consumer price inflation to gradually near its target, boosted by inflation pressures following the global economic recovery.",
        "The member mentioned that the recent low interest rate environment had contributed to boosting the economy and raising the growth rate above its potential level, but with the increased leverage accumulating in the real estate sector, the demand-pull effect seemed to have gradually declined, and investment in other sectors had not produced sufficient added value.",
        "The member attributed this phenomenon to structural factors, such as the restructuring of the global economy, the decline in the core working-age population, and relatively rigid labor and commodity markets.",
        "The member also noted that a possible shortage of retirement funds due to rapid population aging had been encouraging leveraged short-term investment, leading to speculation in real assets.",
        "The member presented the view that, with growth in private-sector credit continuing to outpace that of nominal GDP, stronger macroprudential regulations alone could not effectively curb widening financial imbalances but would only create a balloon effect.",
        "In this regard, the member mentioned that it would be important to reduce the degree of monetary easing to weaken inefficient incentives for investment and curb financial imbalances.",
        "The member also judged that, to prepare for a global economic downturn and the major impacts it would have on the Korean economy, it would be important at this point in time to prevent the accumulation of financial imbalances while carrying out intensive structural reforms to enhance the efficiency of the economy as a whole and to ensure policy space.",
        "The member went on to state that these efforts could boost future consumption further and minimize the inflation gap over the medium-term horizon.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period while observing conditions a little longer.",
        "First, the member noted that the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised downward the growth forecasts for this year and next by 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, to 2.7 percent each.",
        "The member added that these forecasts reflected the widening of corrections in facilities and construction investment, and the negative impacts of the US-China trade dispute on exports.",
        "The member saw that growth was somewhat weaker than existing forecasts, but at 2.7% it was generally not deviating from its potential level and the GDP gap was holding steady at around zero.",
        "The member commented that consumer price inflation was forecast to be 1.6 percent this year, the same as the previous forecast, and 1.7 percent for next year, 0.2 percentage points down from the previous forecast.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although the forecasts were somewhat below the inflation target of 2%, they were generally continuing to moving closer to the target level.",
        "In terms of financial and foreign exchange markets, the member noted that stock prices had fallen greatly and the Korean won had weakened drastically, due mainly to the escalating US-China trade dispute and concerns about US rate hikes, while foreign portfolio investment had seen substantial albeit temporary outflows.",
        "In this regard, the member pointed out that, despite Korea’s strong economic fundamentals and external soundness, markets could see episodes of heightened volatility depending upon future developments in major risk factors.",
        "The member commented that, although household lending growth had slowed somewhat, its absolute level was very high, and it was still continuing to outpace income growth, while sole proprietor loans had grown steadily, led by borrowing related to real estate and leasing, resulting in a large increase in financial exposures to real estate.",
        "Given these developments, the member stressed that close attention should be kept on the risk of the accumulation of financial imbalances in the Korean economy, even though the government’s recent policy measures had helped weaken the upturn of apartment prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region.",
        "Next, concerning the monetary policy response, the member presented the opinion that policy signals and assessments of recent macroeconomic and financial stability conditions, when considered comprehensively, pointed to a need to reduce the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member added that such a policy path appeared even more desirable in light of the developments in monetary policy normalization in major countries, including continued rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve in the future, and given the need to secure policy space over a long-term horizon.",
        "The member noted that projections of growth and inflation were being revised downward, albeit slightly, despite the fact that growth and inflation had not deviated from the earlier forecasts, and members’ opinions were mixed regarding market expectations about the timing of a hike in the Base Rate.",
        "Given these points, the member presented the view that it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period while keeping a close watch on relevant conditions a little longer, since there was no pressing reason to rush to hike the Base Rate at this meeting.",
        "One member, meanwhile, presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while examining future developments in domestic and international economic conditions a little longer.",
        "The member evaluated that the global economy had maintained growth exceeding its potential, despite trade conflicts among major countries and financial unrest in some EMEs.",
        "The member raised concerns that most of the growth improvement since the second quarter had come from the US.",
        "The member, however, offered positive assessments as well, noting that the finalizing of a revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement had led to a view that the US-China trade dispute might not spread globally, and that some indicators in the euro area and Japan were also showing signs of improvements.",
        "The member projected the global economy to show relatively robust growth for some time, in consideration of the expansionary fiscal policies of major countries and the domestic demand stimulus measures of EMEs with favorable external soundness.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member judged that it was sustaining growth consistent with its potential.",
        "The member, however, noted that attention was being paid to the fact that the divergence between exports and domestic demand had continued, with exports continuing their strong growth but the correction in investment being more persistent and deeper than expectations.",
        "Judging from leading indicators, however, the member did not expect the gap between exports and domestic demand to widen further.",
        "The member took the view that, with respect to facilities investment in particular, its decline could stabilize or reverse to a moderate rise, given the number of machinery orders received.",
        "With regard to employment, which had shown sluggishness due to a mix of structural, policy and cyclical factors, the member pointed out that the number of persons employed in the services sector had fallen by a narrower margin when controlling for seasonal factors, and the number of persons employed in the manufacturing sector had increased moderately for three consecutive months.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that, as the degree of improvement was weak and changes in policies that could affect consumer and corporate sentiments continued at home and abroad, it was appropriate to take some time to monitor the relevant developments.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation had risen substantially to 1.9 percent, due to higher international oil prices and agricultural product prices and the ending of a temporary reduction of electricity fees.",
        "The member, meanwhile, commented that core inflation had recorded only 1.0 percent, due to the sustained influences of a drop in administered prices.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, although underlying price trends were difficult to judge, inflationary pressures were estimated to be gradually mounting, given the gradual retreat of factors that had limited inflation for the past several years.",
        "The member added that import prices and other supply-side factors were starting to induce domestic inflation as global prices entered an expansionary phase, while the inflation expectations of the general public had risen slightly of late.",
        "The member saw that demand-side inflationary pressures were no longer acting in a downward direction, but the effects of reduced administered prices were likely to continue for some time.",
        "The member thus forecast that consumer price inflation was unlikely to deviate far from the current level for the time being.",
        "Finally, as to financial stability, the member noted that, although household debt was growing at a slower rate, it was still increasing faster than household income, and growth in sole proprietor loans was also high.",
        "The member thus pointed out the need for constant attention to risk from the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "In addition, the member commented that volatility in price variables had heightened in the financial markets due to the emergence of uncertainties related to the Fed’s rate hikes, and as there were significant uncertainties surrounding the future political agendas and trade and monetary policies of major countries, attention should be paid to the relevant risks.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for some time to buffer against downside risks to the macroeconomy, while paying attention to whether inflation caused by recent cost-side factors would continue and to the possibility of an accumulation of the macroeconomic risks in the real estate market.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the Korean economy was sustaining growth in the mid- to upper-2% range, boosted by the booming world economy, and exports were keeping up their robust growth in the third quarter as well, despite protectionism and the possibility of a slowdown in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that the terms of trade had worsened due to a sustained rise in oil prices, and thus export growth was having a very limited impact on domestic demand.",
        "In other words, the real GDP growth rate was holding steady as net export growth stemming from lower import volume had offset a decline in the contribution of domestic demand to growth, resulting in the slowdown of GNI and nominal income growth.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, the member assessed that consumption was growing steadily owing to expanded government spending, noting that an expansionary fiscal policy and a high income growth rate were likely to act as upside risks, while sluggish employment and a contraction in the business income of self-employed business owners would serve as downside risks.",
        "The member, meanwhile, commented that corporate spending such as construction and facilities investment had contracted and was unlikely to rebound quickly.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member assessed that it could reach close to its 2% target temporarily in the fourth quarter, due mainly to rising oil prices and to base effects.",
        "The member, however, commented that core inflation was still in the 1% range, while core inflation excluding administered prices remained flat in the mid-1% range, and thus underlying prices were not highly likely to rise rapidly.",
        "With respect to asset prices, the member commented that the monetary authorities could not easily address every fluctuation in asset prices, nor were they entrusted with this responsibility.",
        "However, the member mentioned that policy attention needs to be paid only if nationwide asset bubbles accompanied with rapid leverage increase formed because future price adjustments could cause a major negative shock to financial markets and the macroeconomy.",
        "In this regard, the member’s assessment was that the recent surge in apartment prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region did not appear to be a nationwide macroeconomic phenomenon, but rather appeared to have been triggered by housing demand differentiations by region and type, and there was no clear evidence that it was accompanied with the rise in household debt.",
        "The member thus noted that it was desirable to first utilize macroprudential policy to address these issues selectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that domestic long-term market interest rates had been running considerably below US long-term interest rates, which reflects financial market woes on Korea’s growth and inflation.",
        "The member added that capital movements and exchange rate fluctuations due to the differences in the macroeconomic fundamentals between Korea and the US should be understood as part of natural adjustments.",
        "One other member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level, since real economic growth was holding steady around its potential growth path, albeit with some signs of slowing, and inflation growth was more moderate than expectations.",
        "On the external front, the member’s assessment was that, with respect to advanced economies, economic growth in Japan and the EU had been slowing somewhat since the second half of this year, although the US economy was maintaining solid growth.",
        "The member also assessed that emerging market economies were maintaining overall growth, as slower growth in China was offset by robust growth in India and ASEAN countries.",
        "The member expected global trade growth to continue to be impacted by the slower growth in advanced economies next year, as in the second half of this year, but the extent of such impacts to be limited, as emerging market economies accounted for a steadily increasing share of world trade.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that Korean exports were likely to sustain their strength, in reflection of the trends of the world economy and trade, but export growth would slow moderately from the second half of this year.",
        "On the domestic front, the member saw that the correction in construction investment had continued and the correction in facilities investment seen since the second quarter of this year would continue in the second half of this year as well.",
        "The member, however, expressed the opinion that private consumption was maintaining moderate growth and the sharp increase in government spending this year was buffering sluggish investment.",
        "The member noted that, given that the correction in construction investment was an underlying trend, investment would recover somewhat from its current level but was not expected to contribute to growth.",
        "The member also assessed that, in the future, growth in domestic demand would be dependent upon an increase in private consumption.",
        "The member noted that, with respect to private consumption growth, it had shifted to a trend of recovery from a prolonged downturn in the second half of last year and had exceeded GDP growth year-on-year until the first half of this year, but the savings ratio in the household sector still remained high, and thus it was uncertain whether the growth could be maintained.",
        "The Bank of Korea Research Department currently forecast the economic growth rates for this year and next to be 2.7% each, and projected private consumption to increase by 2.7% this year and maintain growth at the same level next year, even if boosted by expanded government spending.",
        "The member assessed these forecasts to have some downside risks.",
        "With regard to inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat, while core inflation had fallen to the lower- to mid-1% range.",
        "The member presented the view that this was due to a slight decline in inflation expectations and to weak drivers for the buildup of underlying inflationary pressures stemming from moderate growth in domestic demand, led by consumption.",
        "With respect to the price path, the member thus expected consumer price inflation to fluctuate in reflection of changes in supply-side factors such as oil prices, with core inflation increasing moderately.",
        "Regarding the Research Department’s downward revision to its core inflation estimates―1.2% for this year and 1.6% for next year―the member’s assessment was that, given that core inflation had generally exhibited rigid movements, the Research Department’s forecast for next year had some degree of downside risk, with administered prices as an uncertainty variable.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng and Mr. Koh, Seung Beom expressed clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at its current level and argued for raising it by 0.25 of a percentage point.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its sound growth.",
        "The global financial markets have shown increased volatility, with government bond yields rising and stock prices falling in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.",
        "- The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth at its potential level generally, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted.",
        "Employment conditions have remained sluggish, with the number of persons employed having risen only slightly.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be somewhat below the path projected in July, but to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-1% level, due mainly to an acceleration in the pace of increase in agricultural product prices and to the ending of a temporary reduction of electricity fees.",
        "Core inflation remained at the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen significantly and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen to a considerable extent, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the rapid decline in stock prices globally.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have increased, in reflection of the changes in interest rates in major countries.",
        "Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat.",
        "Housing sales prices had risen substantially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, but their pace of increase has slowed since the Korean government’s announcement of measures to stabilize the housing market.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment of the global economy was that, although real economic indictors in some advanced economies had weakened somewhat in the first quarter, the global economy had continued its trend of recovery, thanks to expansionary fiscal policies in major countries and favorable business conditions in the IT sector, and global trade had maintained strong growth.",
        "Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global financial markets, instability in the financial markets in emerging market economies heightened, due to the US dollar’s strength stemming from rising US Treasury bond yields.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, despite a correction in investment, the Korean economy was expected to show growth at its potential level in the future, as exports and consumption continued to show favorable movements.",
        "The members, however, judged that there were medium-term uncertainties in the labor market, and added that a close watch should be kept on the possibility that the delayed recovery of the labor market could limit the trend of improvement in consumption.",
        "The members also noted that downside risks included the continued rise of oil prices and stronger protectionism, while upside risks included an improved trade environment with China and expanded government spending stemming from a supplementary budget.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had Bank of Korea website.",
        "risen to 1.6% in April, from 1.3% in the first quarter, and core inflation had also picked up in April compared to the first quarter, showing a shift from the previous downward trend in price inflation.",
        "The members, however, expected that it would take more time for consumer price inflation to stabilize above the target level.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members saw that, on the external side, there was financial instability in some EMEs mainly from US monetary policy normalization, and on the domestic side, growth in household lending by the banking sector had expanded, led by leasehold deposit and other loans.",
        "Accordingly, the members assessed risks to have grown somewhat.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, although the global economy had been maintaining a trend of recovery thanks to expansionary fiscal policies in major countries and favorable business conditions in the IT sector, some EMEs with weak foreign exchange sectors had shown signs of market unrest, due to the strength of the US dollar stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s implementation of monetary policy tightening.",
        "The member stated that, with respect to the domestic financial markets, the won had maintained relative strength thanks to an improvement in South Korea’s relationship with North Korea, and the swap market had generally remained stable.",
        "The member commented that, although the expansion in non-IT exports had been more sluggish than expected, and investment was going through a correction as projected, the real economy was showing recovery somewhat beyond its potential growth level, thanks to strong IT exports and moderate improvement in consumption.",
        "The member saw that, with the share of labor income having shown stability for the past few years in particular, labor income was distributed more widely due to an increase in the number of persons employed.",
        "The member assessed this to have contributed to the trend of improvement in consumption.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that the demand recovery had not contributed to inflationary pressures through wage increases because, despite a decline in average working hours, total working hours had increased due to a constant rise in the economic participation rate stemming from the delayed retirements of workers aged 50 and older.",
        "The member, however, added that there was a high possibility that the decline of total labor supply due to the shrinking working-age population could contribute to higher average wages beginning this year.",
        "Accordingly, the member expected inflation to near its target next year when the base effect would disappear and downside pressures on regulated prices would be offset by the upside pressures on global prices, given current domestic demand pressures and room for future wage hikes.",
        "The member noted that the degree of monetary policy accommodation should be determined in consideration of its impacts on prices and the real economy over a medium-term horizon.",
        "The member stated that the accommodative monetary policy for the past years had been driving inflation through boosted domestic demand, but the housing oversupply that would be observed from this year would put downward pressure on housing rents and prices while also showing direct social costs from inefficient resource allocation.",
        "The member added that attention should be paid to the possibility of balloon effects being created in various sectors if the current stance remained unchanged.",
        "In short, the member saw a need to somewhat reduce the current degree of accommodation, but expressed the view that the monetary policy accommodation stance should be adjusted while closely observing the followings: changes in external conditions, which had undergone rapid changes of late; uncertain balloon effects; and the currently ongoing structural reforms, particularly in the labor market.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent this time.",
        "Looking at the recent economic situations since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on April 12th, the member judged uncertainties surrounding the future growth and inflation paths to have heightened somewhat, but saw that there was not a high possibility of the domestic economy significantly deviating from its previously expected trajectory.",
        "The member stated that investment was undergoing a correction phase, but exports and consumption remained strong.",
        "Pointing to the implementation of a supplementary budget and signs of improvement in trade conditions with China, the member projected the solid trend of economic growth to continue at its potential level in the future.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that consumer price inflation would likely accelerate to its target of 2.0 percent, as originally forecast.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that, given that the Korean economy was maintaining growth at its potential level, the sluggish employment conditions of late seemed to be attributable to structural factors, not cyclical factors, and thus it was necessary to take structural or microeconomic policy measures rather than utilize macroeconomic business cycle adjustment instruments.",
        "The member expected the supplementary budget to have some effect in that it was a microeconomic measure focused on the employment sector, including the creation of jobs for the youth.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, with respect to financial stability, risks had increased somewhat.",
        "The member pointed out that, on the external front, there was a low possibility of financial instability in EMEs spreading to Korea in consideration of its favorable external soundness, but the possibility of continued monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve causing instability in Korea’s capital flows and domestic financial market price variables could not be ruled out.",
        "The member noted that, on the domestic front, household credit was continuing to grow more rapidly than in the past, and corporate credit had also shown accelerated growth of late.",
        "The member went on to comment that, if accommodative financial conditions continued, there was a possibility that the rapid growth of private sector credit would not be contained, which could undermine external confidence.",
        "The member thus stressed the need to closely watch the relevant developments.",
        "With respect to the corresponding monetary policy direction, the member expressed the opinion that risks on the macroeconomic side had shown no great changes, with the economy expected to maintain growth at its potential level this year and consumer price inflation to near its target.",
        "The member, however, stated that risks on the domestic and international financial stability fronts had increased somewhat.",
        "The member thus noted that, at this juncture, it was necessary to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while giving more attention to financial stability in monetary policy operations.",
        "In addition, the member found it desirable to raise the Base Rate to an appropriate level in times of solid growth in order to ensure space for monetary policy in preparation for a possible change in the phase of the business cycle over a longer time horizon.",
        "However, the member stated that some had raised concerns about an economic slowdown due to growing uncertainties surrounding domestic and international conditions of late, and that a hike in the Base Rate under these circumstances could deteriorate economic sentiment.",
        "The member thus expressed the view that it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, while keeping a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions a little longer.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, based on the judgment that it would be appropriate to determine when to raise the Base Rate after further examining whether the uptrend in prices would accelerate or continue.",
        "Looking at the real economy, the member’s evaluation was that, despite some risk factors, the trend of growth had continued while going through adjustment due to one-off factors.",
        "The member mentioned that some real economic indicators had weakened in Europe and other regions, and that the uptrend of US interest rates had led to financial instability in vulnerable EMEs such as Argentina and Turkey.",
        "However, the member stated that such instability was unlikely to develop into a liquidity crunch in the international financial markets, and assessed Korean exports, particularly of semiconductors, as maintaining their strength driven by the continued rapid growth of the global trade volume.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, the member also evaluated that, although there were some negative indicators, they were not serious enough to undermine the original forecast of sustained growth.",
        "The member went on to state that the April monitoring indicators had suggested signs of a slowdown in consumption and a correction in facilities investment, but these merely represented a technical decline from the previous rapid growth and thus it was a little too early to see this decline as a trend reversal.",
        "Looking at the labor market, meanwhile, the member noted that employment conditions had worsened even further, as shown in the continued sluggish employment in the wholesale & retail and food & accommodation sectors and in the rapid slowdown in the year-on-year change in manufacturing employment in April, while growth in wages, and basic wages in particular, had been accelerating substantially this year.",
        "The member attributed the worsening employment sluggishness and faster wage growth to a combination of factors, including cyclical changes in labor demand in line with economic recovery, structural changes in labor demand caused by the restructurings of some manufacturing companies, and structural changes in labor supply following the minimum wage hike, and went on to state that the medium-term uncertainties for the Korean economy came from the labor market.",
        "As for inflation, the member noted that there had been a shift in the downward trend of inflation, with consumer price inflation accelerating from prices of agricultural and petroleum products, increasing from 1.2% to 1.4% over the same period.",
        "The member also mentioned that, amid the positive GDP gap, inflation was forecast to accelerate and the real neutral interest rate remained on the rise, as suggested by global economic trends, and thus the member argued that the policy judgment that the future policy rate path should also increase still held.",
        "However, the member assessed that, since inflation remained low, the timing of rate hikes could still be adjusted after watching for the forecast of higher inflation to be realized.",
        "Concerning financial stability, the member’s evaluation was that the growth in bank lending to households, having exhibited signs of slowing down early this year, had started to accelerate again from March, and added that this faster growth, driven by leasehold deposit and other loans, was different from the expansion in household lending up to 2017, which had been led by group lending.",
        "The member also emphasized that, compared with other loans, leasehold deposit loans had inherent factors weakening risk management incentives for banks: such loans were guaranteed by public institutions and their principal was excluded from the DSR calculation, which is why some banks had recently been aggressively marketing them.",
        "The member stressed that it would be necessary to carefully reexamine factors distorting risk management incentives for financial institutions involved in leasehold deposit lending.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member forecast that the global economy would maintain strong growth exceeding its potential this year and global trade would sustain strong growth for the time being, and assessed the weakening of real economic indicators in some advanced countries during the first quarter as having been attributable to one-off factors.",
        "The member added that in the medium and long term, however, the possibility could not be ruled out that the spread of trade protectionism, rising oil prices, and financial instability in some EMEs could act as downside risks to the global economy and trade.",
        "The member stated that the Korean economy had exhibited solid, export-led growth in the first quarter but this faster growth had been attributable also to one-off factors, such as a base effect and increased demand during the Winter Olympic Games, and expected the quarter-on-quarter growth rate to slow down in the second quarter.",
        "The member evaluated that, looking at the major economic indicators released since the previous meeting, the average growth rate during the first half of this year would not deviate far from the April forecast, and added that the secular improvement in the output gap had continued.",
        "The member expressed the view that there was, however, a mix of upside and downside risks on the future growth path.",
        "As for major downside risks, the member pointed to the possibility of a slower-than-expected recovery in employment that might restrict future improvements in consumption, and went on to argue that, although the pace of increase in nominal wages, and those of regular employees in particular, had been accelerating, any corresponding growth in employment had not yet been seen.",
        "Second, the member mentioned that if the recent rise in oil prices persisted for a long time, this might have negative impacts on the real economy, restricting households’ real purchasing power and increasing corporate production costs.",
        "Third, the member stressed that attention should be paid to the fact that export growth still had been seen mostly in some IT sectors and that the pace of increase in the international prices of related items had recently been slowing significantly, and added that hikes in the prices of oil and other commodities and the spread of trade protectionism might lead companies to make conservative investment and employment decisions.",
        "On the other hand, the member expressed the view that improved trade conditions with China, an increased number of foreign tourists, and increased government expenditure following the drawing up of a supplementary budget were likely to act as upside risks.",
        "Meanwhile, with respect to the reduction in statutory working hours scheduled to come into effect in July this year, the member mentioned that the effects on business activities and consumption would depend on the specifics of implementation.",
        "Concerning inflation, the member stated that consumer price inflation had accelerated to the mid-1% level and expected upside pressure on inflation to increase gradually if the secular improvement in the output gap continued, but the member also forecast that it would take more time for inflation to stabilize above the target level.",
        "The member went on to argue that the price path for the second half of this year might exhibit higher volatility, however, due mainly to the possible persistence of high global oil prices, movements of the Korean won’s exchange rate, and possible hikes in regulated prices following local elections.",
        "Looking at the financial and foreign exchange markets, the member expressed the view that the markets had remained stable overall but attention should be paid to the fact that household lending growth had started to accelerate again and that monetary normalization in major countries might progress more rapidly than expected.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite financial instability in some EMEs occurring in the course of the recent US monetary policy normalization, the global economy had overall sustained a relatively high rate of growth, and the Korean economy accordingly had continued to exhibit a growth rate close to its potential level, driven by exports.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that the export boom had been concentrated in specific industries such as semiconductors, and that concerns had been raised about a possible weakening of structural competitiveness in some other industries.",
        "The member also noted that the restructurings of some manufacturing sectors suffering from worsening profitability seemed to have acted as a key factor, along with the recent shock from higher employment-related expenses, causing the pace of growth in the number of persons employed to slow significantly.",
        "The member assessed that, unlike these structural or aggregate supply-side changes, aggregate demand-side changes were difficult to identify.",
        "The member also argued that increased government spending, particularly in health and welfare, and signs that the plunge in the number of foreign tourists was easing had partly acted as buffers against insufficient aggregate domestic demand, but there were growing uncertainties regarding how the recent changes in labor market conditions would affect household consumption and corporate investment spending decisions.",
        "The member accordingly argued that, as there were too much uncertainties to predict future growth and inflation at this point of time, it would be necessary to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the time being and, at the same time, to examine whether aggregate demand in the Korean economy was increasing in line with its forecast by closely analyzing the overall macroeconomy, including economic conditions and inflation.",
        "The member, meanwhile, expected capital flow fluctuations, caused partly by US monetary policy normalization, to be absorbed smoothly by flexible exchange rate adjustments.",
        "The member went on to state that the household debt problem would be eased gradually by a housing market correction and by continuously strengthening macroprudential policies.",
        "One other member expressed the view that it would be desirable to observe economic and inflation developments as well as international financial market conditions a little longer, while holding the Base Rate at the current level of 1.50% this time.",
        "Concerning the outlook for the global economy, the member expected the trend of growth to continue overall, with some advanced economies recovering from their sluggishness during the first quarter.",
        "However, the member also argued that it was necessary to closely monitor the impacts on international financial markets from monetary normalization in major countries in line with their economic recoveries, and also the possibility of consequent financial instability in EMEs.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was that, while the economy had been overall exhibiting modest growth, the recent sluggish employment conditions and other factors might negatively affect private consumption, and attention was needed to be paid to how the slower growth of the real estate market would affect future construction investment.",
        "The member stated that exports had remained buoyant overall but concerns had continued about the dependency of the export growth on specific items, including semiconductors.",
        "The member went on to argue that Korean exports did not seem to have fully taken advantage of favorable global economic and trade growth, and it would therefore be necessary to examine whether export-related industries were suffering from worsening structural problems.",
        "The member also stressed that, as concerns had been raised that the employment sluggishness had been attributable to structural factors relating to the manufacturing industry and the self-employed, it would be necessary to analyze the effectiveness of the government’s employment policy measures.",
        "The member’s assessment was that consumer price inflation had accelerated somewhat while core inflation had remained low, and the member’s forecast was that inflation would fail to reach its target of 2 percent this year, even when upside risks from oil price hikes were factored in.",
        "In overall consideration of real economic conditions, the member evaluated that it would be necessary to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy for the time being, since there existed various uncertainties related to business activities, concerns had arisen about labor market conditions, and the inflation gap was highly likely to remain negative this year, although the output gap remained positive.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member took the view that it would be appropriate to pay more attention to the recent heightening of international financial market volatility while coping with the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "With respect to household debt, the member called for analysis of the trend of growth in credit lending, and stated that the possibility of continued demand for housing-related loans should not be overlooked, considering factors such as the demand for new apartments.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that, amid the growing financial instability in EMEs following the appreciation of the US dollar, it would be advisable to prepare against a possible increase in international financial market volatility in line for example with the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike in June.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economy has continued its robust growth.",
        "Financial markets in some emerging market economies with weak external soundness have shown instability, as capital outflows from them have increased.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.",
        "has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although facilities investment has slowed somewhat.",
        "Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having remained at a low level.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in April.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "increases in the prices of agricultural products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has also been in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "long-term market interest rates have increased, under the effects chiefly of rising government bond yields in major countries, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, in line mainly with the global strengthening of the US dollar and with the decline in risks related to North Korea.",
        "Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, led by unsecured loans.",
        "The paces of increase in housing sales prices have slowed, especially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on “Recent Economic Developments,” “FX and International Finance Trends” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, despite slowdowns of economic growth in China, the euro area, and Japan, the global economy had continued to show strong growth overall, led by a trend of solid growth in the US economy.",
        "As for the global financial markets, members mentioned that the volatility of stock prices and exchange rates in the US and other advanced economies (AEs) had increased, but the financial unrest in some emerging market economies (EMEs) had eased.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the domestic economy had largely sustained growth at a level that did not deviate far from its potential, as exports had remained buoyant and consumption had maintained modest growth, although facilities and construction investment had continued to go through corrections.",
        "Members, however, mentioned that uncertainties in economic conditions had increased, due for instance to some unstable industries and continued employment sluggishness.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had moved near its 2 percent target, while core inflation had remained at around 1.0 percent.",
        "Members expected CPI to fall somewhat going forward, given recent underlying inflation and the decline in oil prices, and fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1 percent range, not deviating greatly from its target.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that the volatility in the stock market in particular had expanded in October, due mainly to mounting external risks, but then had subsided somewhat in November.",
        "Members noted that household debt growth was slowing but continued to outpace income growth.",
        "Members also pointed out that, although relevant regulations were being continually strengthened, the possibility of a balloon effect in other sectors could not be ruled out.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points for the intermeeting period.",
        "Two members, meanwhile, called for keeping the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting, as the downside risks to the real economic growth path had expanded somewhat of late, acceleration in price inflation was still modest, and the downside risks to the growth path for next year had increased slightly.",
        "The member evaluated that, looking at the real economy, downside risks to growth for the next year had increased somewhat, as uncertainties about the external environment had heightened further and the underlying trend of recovery in private consumption was showing signs of slowdown.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, on the international front, the US economy was maintaining solid growth, but in other AEs a trend of weakening underlying economic growth was compounded by one-off downside risk factors such as the delayed emission certifications of German automobiles.",
        "The member also added that the slower growth in the Chinese economy had become more clearly marked since the second quarter.",
        "The member expressed the view that downside risks to global economic growth and world trade growth for next year had expanded somewhat, led by doubts about whether the boom in the US would continue and uncertainties about the severity of the slowdown in economic growth in China and about developments related to the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The member noted that, despite slower growth in exports to EMEs, Korea’s exports to the US and other AEs had actually shown a rebound from the second quarter, sustaining robust growth.",
        "The member, however, pointed out that, particularly since the recent strong exports were interpreted by some as due to increased imports by import-reliant companies in AEs in anticipation of worsening trade disputes, they could be offset by another fall in 2019.",
        "Looking at domestic demand, the member expressed the opinion that retail sales were estimated not to have recovered from the decline seen since September and services production remained unchanged, together implying a slowdown in the recovery of private consumption.",
        "In addition, the member noted that there were considerable uncertainties as to whether the high private consumption growth of the past one year could be maintained, since the savings ratio in the household sector still remained high.",
        "The member also expected the future growth of private consumption to be dependent upon the effects of consumption boosting policy measures such as the individual consumption tax cut on automobiles and increased government spending.",
        "The member’s assessment was that investment, another element of domestic demand, was continuing to undergo a correction overall, against the backdrop of a downward adjustment in construction investment.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had stood at 1.9 percent in September and then 2 percent in October, due for instance to a hike in agricultural product prices.",
        "The member, however, commented that recent price rises were all driven by supply-side factors, despite the fast pace of wage growth this year.",
        "The member pointed out that price inflation thus showed no trend of acceleration as core inflation remained unprecedentedly low, having recorded 1.0 percent in September and 0.9 percent in October.",
        "In addition, the member pointed out that there had been a slight slowing of price inflation with respect to items sensitive to economic conditions and of core inflation with items whose prices are administered excluded, and this implied a slight weakening of demand-side inflationary pressures and was also consistent with the recent real economic path.",
        "The member added that there were still downside risks to the Bank of Korea Research Department’s October core inflation and consumer price inflation forecasts of 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, for next year.",
        "Meanwhile, concerning the opinion that a monetary policy response was needed from a financial stability perspective due to an excessive pace of household debt growth, cited as grounds for a Base Rate hike, the member expressed the opinion that, while household debt growth in Korea had steadily outpaced income growth since the global financial crisis, it was questionable if this should be addressed through monetary policy rather than prudential policy, the latter of which was heavily favored by academia and major central banks.",
        "The member noted that, although household debt was still increasing faster than household income, the situation was different from that of the past.",
        "The member stated that lending growth associated with sales of new apartments and housing sales was stabilizing.",
        "For instance, growth in bank group loans associated with sales of new apartments had shifted to a slowdown since last year and individual mortgage lending with bank lending for leasehold deposits excluded had turned negative year on year as of October 2018.",
        "The member, meanwhile, pointed out that bank lending for leasehold deposits and credit lending had recently led growth in debt, a pattern attributable to the easing of the application of prudential regulations, such as guarantees and DSR regulations, on leasehold deposit lending and to banks’ active use of this for sales of loans.",
        "The member presented the view that, therefore, it was appropriate to respond first by adopting microprudential policy.",
        "The member added that, in recognition of this, the policy authorities had included the strengthening of requirements for guarantees on leasehold deposit loans in the September 13 real estate measures.",
        "The member noted that the effects of these measures should be observed, and if their effects are limited, measures to strengthen DSR regulations related to leasehold deposit loans and credit loans should be reviewed.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting, focusing more on financial stability, while maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance in consideration of the real economy, including economic activity and consumer prices.",
        "With respect to the global economy, the member evaluated that, although the US economy was sustaining its trend of solid growth, growth in China, the euro area and Japan had slowed.",
        "The member saw that, although international oil prices had shown a sharp downward trend and global trade growth was slowing slightly, the slower world growth and sluggish global trade were attributable to one-off factors as well.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that the world economy had generally not deviated far from the path forecast in October.",
        "As to the international financial markets, the member added that volatility in the stock and foreign exchange markets in the US and other AEs had heightened, while financial unrest in EMEs had shown some stability.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member saw that growth of private consumption had not deviated far from the level forecast in October, despite sluggish employment.",
        "The member evaluated that exports had shown high growth, due mainly to strong demand for semiconductors.",
        "The member pointed out that, as concerns had recently been raised about exports driven by the electrical and electronic industry, the relevant trends should be analyzed closely.",
        "The member added that the corrections in facilities and construction investment had persisted.",
        "Concerning some negative forecasts for major industries, the member stressed that the structural problems of those industries should be reviewed to expand their mid- to long-term growth potentials.",
        "The member noted that employment conditions had improved somewhat with the number of persons employed increasing slightly in October.",
        "The member then assessed this as strongly attributable to employment growth in the health & welfare sector, led by the government’s job creation policy, and in the construction sector, associated with an increase in the availability of apartments.",
        "The member added that employment conditions were unlikely to be improved greatly next year as well, as the sluggishness in the manufacturing, wholesale & retail, and food & accommodation sectors was continuing.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, although economic activities and employment conditions had not been deviating far from the October forecasts, concerns about downside risks to growth were also growing, as seen in continuing declines in economic and sentiment indicators.",
        "The member expected consumer prices for this year and next to be generally consistent with the October forecasts.",
        "The member pointed out that, while consumer price inflation was running closer to its 2 percent target, core inflation remained at around 1 percent.",
        "The member stressed that, going forward, the Board should assess the underlying movements of inflation while keeping a careful watch on international oil prices, which were plunging after a sharp rise, and while closely monitoring increases in some public utility fees.",
        "The member assessed that, in consideration of real economic conditions, the GDP gap was estimated to be negative, albeit slightly, and demand-side inflationary pressures were unlikely to be high, and thus the accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained for some time in the future.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that it was time to give greater attention to financial stability.",
        "The member pointed out that, although household debt was expected to show a slower pace, affected for instance by government policy, household debt was still increasing faster than household income.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that a Base Rate hike could further increase the interest payment burdens of vulnerable borrowers, but judging from stress test results, such burdens were estimated to be bearable.",
        "The member also saw that the government’s active micro finance measures and measures for vulnerable borrowers would contribute to the easing of such burdens.",
        "Finally, the member noted that, given Korea’s sound macroeconomic conditions and high external credit standing, the inversion of the US and Korean policy rates was unlikely to immediately lead to large-scale capital outflows.",
        "The member, however, stressed that various scenarios should be reviewed, since there were concerns about the emergence of risks in the course of the US Fed’s policy rate hikes and developments in the US-China trade dispute.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50% to 1.75% at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that fundamental and structural measures were required to cope with rapid population ageing on the domestic front and continuous sudden changes in global market conditions, and added that the Korean economy had remained flat in the long-lasting low-growth environment, showing a low level of economic volatility.",
        "In line with this, the member also expressed the view that, while accommodative monetary policy had been boosting domestic demand, it had been accompanied by inefficient resource allocation and had been widening financial imbalances due to a lack of a virtuous economic cycle.",
        "In this regard, in the current situation in which demand-side inflation pressures were weak but sustained, it would be desirable to adjust incentives for savings and investment toward the level of the neutral interest rate to curb financial imbalances, and since this would coincide with an increase in fiscal expenditure for the vulnerable, it would not cause any significant changes in aggregate demand-pull pressures.",
        "First, looking at inflation, the member evaluated that demand-side inflation pressures remained intact, with the index for inflation excluding administered prices showing upward movement, and went on to state that inflation for October had reached its target of 2.0 percent, boosted by rises in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "The member also explained that core inflation and personal service charges had exhibited slower growth, but when administered items were excluded, the rate of growth in personal service charges had been adjusted upward to 2.7 percent from 2.2 percent, and that in core inflation to 1.4 percent from 0.9 percent.",
        "The member assessed meanwhile that financial imbalances had continued to build up, and that they could be understood as a form of waste since the resources used to increase domestic demand had not created sustainable added values over time.",
        "The member argued that financial imbalances in the financial markets begin with the mispricing of risks triggered by a search for yield exceeding real economic fundamentals, and added that these imbalances, although accumulated on the balance sheets of financial institutions, are hard to measure.",
        "In terms of the real economy, meanwhile, the member took the view that the excessive expansion in debt relative to income had made it easier to measure financial imbalances.",
        "The member stated that the recent imbalances in the Korean economy were shown in the herd behavior toward the real estate market ─ leveraged real estate investment in pursuit of earnings from leasing and asset price gains had been increasing, particularly among older people, in line with growing attention to a shortage of savings in preparation for populating ageing.",
        "The member also added that the easing of borrowing restrictions had led to an excessive housing supply and falls in leasehold deposit prices and monthly rents nationwide.",
        "Furthermore, the member explained that, since 2017 when regulations on residential real estate had been strengthened, lending for commercial real estate purchases had been rapidly increasing and yields far in excess of deposit rates fueled by expectations of asset price rises had acted as investment incentives, and went on to state that this had led to an oversupply as seen in the housing market and also to a shift to a rise in the office vacancy rate that had declined last year.",
        "The member also pointed out that leaseholders of commercial real estate had been increasing, particularly among small business owners, and in light of this, if business conditions slowed in the future, it might cause related loans to turn sour.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the housing market was becoming somewhat stable due to a variety of government regulations.",
        "The member expressed the view that loan interest repayment capacity had to be built up through net income growth so that the accumulation of financial imbalances could be fundamentally resolved, but given the structure of the Korean economy and the oversupply in the real estate market, debt growth had not led to an increase in the potential growth rate.",
        "The member added that, as a result, it was highly likely that inflation would accelerate and non-performing loans increase.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member evaluated that Korean economic growth had slowed since the second quarter to show a 0.6% quarter-on-quarter increase and annualized growth at the mid-2 percent level, and explained that the growth was dependent upon semiconductor exports and fiscal expenditure and thus seemed somewhat unstable, while employment in the private sector had been highly lackluster.",
        "The member took the view that most economic indicators had been shifting to a downward trend and China’s economic slowdown could worsen in the course of trade conflicts and debt restructuring, which made it difficult to take an optimistic view of future economic conditions.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, the member explained that facilities and construction investment had continued to go through corrections and private consumption growth had been slowing.",
        "The member also pointed out that sluggish employment, a decline in the business income of small business owners, and a surge in non-consumption expenditures had held back growth in disposable income and private consumption, and government spending alone had maintained strong growth.",
        "With regard to underlying inflation, the member’s assessment was that it had remained low in reflection of sluggish domestic demand.",
        "The member mentioned that core inflation had fallen to around 1 percent, and had remained at the mid-1 percent level even when excluding administered prices.",
        "The member judged that there would be little possibility of a rapid increase in underlying inflation, given that the outlook for economic conditions was not optimistic.",
        "The member expected consumer price inflation to remain at around 2 percent for the time being, due mainly to the year-on-year increase in oil prices and to base-period effects, and to gradually decline later on to converge to the level of core inflation, with one-off factors fading away.",
        "The member stated that Treasury bond yields, in reflection of market concerns about the downside risks to the macroeconomy mentioned above, had declined significantly since the second half of the year and that yields on bonds of all maturities had remained considerably below those on US Treasuries.",
        "Nevertheless, the exchange rates and FX markets remained stable, and the member argued that it could be interpreted as showing that financial markets were concerned more about the possibility of domestic macroeconomic contraction than about external soundness of our economy.",
        "Meanwhile, the member explained that growth in household debt, which had exhibited a sharp rise over the years, had continued to outpace that in household income, but various stress tests indicated little possibility of household debt posing a threat to the financial markets as a whole.",
        "The member also noted that household debt growth had been on a downward trend since last year, and forecast that it would slow to a level not far exceeding income growth.",
        "The member presented the opinion that, at this point in time when strong macroprudential measures, such as the September 13 real estate measures and the DSR regulations, were expected to slow down household debt growth, there was room for disagreement over the need or benefits of a Base Rate hike, while its cost ─ greater downside risks to the macroeconomy ─ seemed evident.",
        "The member also argued that the fundamental role of monetary policy should be to reduce costs such as a high unemployment rate and low capacity utilization ratio incurred by idle real resources and to stabilize the economy and inflation by doing so, rather than addressing inefficient micro-level resource allocation, such as herd behavior with respect to financial resources.",
        "The member went on to argue that, in this respect, it would be desirable to carry out monetary policy with more focus on reducing downside risks to the macroeconomy than on easing financial imbalances at this point in time when underlying inflation had remained below its target and concerns about an economic slowdown had been steadily increasing.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent this time.",
        "The member evaluated that, since the previous monetary policy meeting, domestic and overseas financial market volatility had increased significantly, but the real economy had shown relatively stable movements and remained close to the path forecast in October by the Bank of Korea’s Research Department.",
        "The member stated that global economy, and the US economy in particular, was estimated to have maintained growth exceeding its potential level, the euro area had been exhibiting slower-than-expected growth, the Japanese economy had recovered from temporary sluggishness, and manufacturing-related indicators in Asian EMEs had been improving.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the Korean economy had been growing at a pace near its potential growth rate, but exports had been the primary driver of such growth and the correction in investment would continue for an extended period of time.",
        "However, the member expected that, although construction investment would remain sluggish for the time being, the downward trend in facilities investment would ease and consumption would maintain modest growth, narrowing the gap between exports and domestic demand.",
        "Looking at financial stability conditions, the member mentioned that, although household debt growth had been slowing, it had still outpaced household income growth and, combined with demand for lending prior to the implementation of stronger regulations, it had even accelerated somewhat in October.",
        "The member evaluated that, despite there being little chance of mortgage loans increasing significantly thanks to the continued strengthening of related regulations, the possibility could not be ruled out of a balloon effect in which demand for lending would flow into other sectors, and went on to argue that the continued increase in private-sector leverage despite a number of micro-level regulations could suggest that there was latent demand for lending under accommodative financial conditions.",
        "In this regard, the member took the view that, if growth and inflation were generally satisfactory, the possibility of financial imbalance accumulation should be given substantial consideration when judging the appropriateness of the monetary policy easing stance.",
        "Meanwhile, the member presented the view that, due to destabilizing factors such as US-China trade dispute, monetary policy normalization in major countries, and political conditions in the euro region, there were growing concerns in the financial markets about a possibility of a drastic turn in the global economic cycle, but on the other hand, the recent slowdown could be considered as a temporary volatility, instead of a trend-shift, that often occurs when growth decelerates to settle into a more sustainable pace.",
        "The member’s judgment was that there was continued support for the forecast that the global economy might undergo a correction but would remain favorable next year as well, given that global liquidity conditions had remained accommodative despite monetary policy normalization in major countries, which was estimated to be favorable for the real economy, and that labor market conditions in major countries had improved rapidly but had not worsened the outlook for corporate profitability, with wage growth not outpacing productivity growth.",
        "The member added that other grounds for such judgment included the fact that the level of inventory in the manufacturing sector was not too high and that policy measures to boost domestic demand had been developed in countries with strong external soundness.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member expressed the view that, while policy uncertainty and structural issues make difficult any strong judgement on longer-term growth path, sustained export growth and expansionary fiscal policy would work to keep the growth rate in the mid- to upper-2 percent range, as projected by the Bank of Korea’s Research Department.",
        "However, the member still raised caution about potential negative impact of financial market volatility on growth, given its self-fulling nature when it continues for long.",
        "The member evaluated that the recent acceleration in consumer price inflation had been due to upward pressures created by agricultural product prices, while the slowdown in core inflation had been attributable to downward pressures resulting from policy factors such as a temporary automobile tax cut.",
        "The member went on to state that, although it was difficult to understand the trend of underlying inflation due to various irregular factors, it had been noted that the factors that had limited inflation over the past several years were diminishing in the medium- and long term.",
        "The member added that consumer price inflation was expected to go through a correction for the time being, due chiefly to the recent declines in international oil prices and temporary fuel tax cuts, but would likely near its target in the medium term.",
        "In overall consideration of the factors mentioned above, the member judged that it would be appropriate to somewhat scale back degree of monetary easing, which is expected to work in favor of curbing concerns about the widening of financial imbalances as well enhancing monetary policy flexibility over a long-term horizon.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be advisable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent this time.",
        "The member judged that, although there had been ups and downs in the monthly data, from a broader perspective exports had remained favorable and consumption had maintained steady growth, despite significant corrections in investment, and the growth rate had generally remained close to its potential level.",
        "However, the member also expressed the view that uncertainties surrounding economic conditions had heightened, including concerns about the US-China trade dispute and China’s economic slowdown on the external side and instability in some industries and continued sluggishness in employment on the domestic side.",
        "Looking at inflation, the member explained that consumer price inflation had moved near its 2 percent target and that considering the recent underlying inflation trend and oil price declines, CPI was forecast to decelerate slightly but remain close to its target, fluctuating within the mid- to upper-1 percent range.",
        "The member’s assessment was that volatility in domestic financial markets, and stock markets in particular, had heightened greatly in October owing largely to increased external risks, and had eased somewhat in November.",
        "The member also pointed out that, although funding conditions for corporations remained favorable, major domestic and overseas risk factors existed and attention should be paid to the possibility of credit risk aversion being increased as well.",
        "Concerning financial stability, the member mentioned that, although the recent government measures had greatly weakened expectations of housing price rises, October had recorded the year’s largest increase in household lending from banks and non-banks.",
        "The member evaluated that household lending was forecast to maintain the recent trend of slowing growth but continue to grow faster than household income, making it difficult to eliminate the risk of financial imbalances accumulating.",
        "The member explained that the recent communications regarding the direction of monetary policy had suggested that it would be desirable to pay more attention to financial stability conditions and reduce the degree of monetary accommodation, if the growth rate did not deviate far from its potential level and inflation remained close to its target.",
        "The member took the view that, with the recent economic and financial situations satisfying such conditions, a Base Rate hike would satisfy market expectations while serving as a slight correction to the continuing accommodative monetary policy stance, and would therefore have only limited negative impacts on the financial markets and the real economy.",
        "In terms of financial stability, meanwhile, the member added that the rate hike was expected to work to supplement the recent various macroprudential policy measures and have substantial positive effects in terms of easing financial imbalances, including the accumulation of household debt.",
        "In this regard, the member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting, and went on to argue that the hike would help secure monetary policy space over a longer-term horizon and ease market unrest caused by the widening gap between the Base Rate and the US Fed policy rate.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Dr. Cho, Dongchul and Dr. Shin, Inseok expressed clear opposition to the idea of raising the Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points and argued for keeping it at its current level.",
        "raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.75%, for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economy has maintained its trend of generally sound growth, despite signs of weakening somewhat during the 3rd quarter.",
        "The high volatility in the global financial markets has continued, with stock prices in major countries falling for example, but the financial unrest in some vulnerable emerging countries has eased slightly.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the political uncertainties in the euro area.",
        "growth at its potential level generally, as consumption has continued to grow modestly and exports have maintained favorable movements, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted.",
        "The sluggishness in employment conditions has lessened somewhat, with the amount of increase in the number of persons employed having picked up slightly.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in October, and to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "in prices of agricultural and petroleum products accelerated.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at around the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain near the target level for some time, and then fall slightly and fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1% range.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "expanded and then in November diminished moderately.",
        "Stock prices fell considerably, in line mostly with drops in stock prices in major countries, before then rebounding on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have declined, and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen slightly.",
        "The amount of increase in household lending expanded in October, while the pace of increase in housing sales prices slowed due to the Korean government’s measures to stabilize the housing market.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment of the global economy was that, with economic expansion in the US and other advanced economies continuing, emerging economies had been gradually showing clearer economic recovery, driven for instance by the stability of commodity prices and the favorable trend of trade growth.",
        "Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global financial markets, with long-term interest rates in major countries rising and stock markets fluctuating, the volatility of interest rates and exchange rates had expanded.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, despite a slowdown in construction investment, the Korean economy had continued to exhibit growth in line with the path projected in January, with exports and facilities investment sustaining buoyancy and consumption maintaining its trend of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace.",
        "Members, however, added that there was a need to pay attention to changes in export and employment conditions in line for instance with stronger protectionism by the US and a foreign automaker’s decision to shut down a factory in Korea, while bearing in mind that employment was growing, led by export manufacturing industries, and employment growth was slowing in the service industries closely associated with domestic demand.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation was expected to gradually approach the target level after a time gap with economic activity recovering, given that (i) the slowdown in inflation in Bank of Korea website.",
        "January was mainly attributable to non-cyclical factors such as a freeze in insurance premiums and the base effect from prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and that (ii) the rate of increase in the business cycle-sensitive price index was in the upper-1 percent range.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members’ assessment was that, with stock price volatility rising, the yield curve had steepened and the term premium had risen in the bond market, but corporate bond credit spreads and foreign currency liquidity conditions were stable.",
        "Members emphasized that, although slower growth in household lending was continuing, there was a need to continually monitor credit lending growth and the impacts of the surge in real estate prices in some areas of Seoul.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the view that it would be necessary to maintain the accommodative monetary policy until economic recovery firms up such that the trend of decline in underlying inflation is reversed.",
        "The member noted that as major advanced economies had recently shown rapid paces of recovery, the negative GDP gap was estimated to be almost closed or to have turned positive.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, in the US in particular, with the labor market assessed as being at full employment, there were signs of typical demand-pull inflation driven by wage hikes, providing logical and substantive grounds for monetary policy normalization.",
        "The member added that the Euro area and Japan were maintaining very accommodative monetary policies, as price inflation was still running well below target, although labor force slack had declined rapidly with economic growth continuing to significantly exceed potential growth.",
        "The member noted that, unlike the reflation trend in advanced economies, core inflation in the Korean economy had been continuing to decline, albeit at a moderate pace, to the lower-1 percent range over the past two years.",
        "The member commented that this suggested that, in contrast to other advanced economies, domestic demand in the Korean economy had not recovered sufficiently to boost price inflation overall.",
        "The member added that, given that there was also little sign of improvement in employment in the domestic demand-led services industry, the projection that ‘consumer price inflation will approach its 2-percent target in the second half of this year, dependent upon economic recovery’ also seemed somewhat uncertain.",
        "The member pointed out that a decline in the inflation rate could act to effectively tighten the monetary policy stance by raising real interest rates, even if the Base Rate remained unchanged.",
        "The member then emphasized the need to review how accommodative the current Base Rate of 1.50 percent actually is.",
        "The member thus judged it necessary at this juncture to set the primary goal of monetary policy as an increase in price inflation through recovery of domestic demand.",
        "To this end, the member expressed the view that it was necessary to monitor whether economic recovery firms up such that labor market conditions improve and the trend of decline in price inflation is reversed, while maintaining the current level of the Base Rate for some time.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, as exports and facilities investment continued their strength despite a slowdown in construction investment, and as consumption was maintaining a trend of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, the domestic real economy was sustaining growth not deviating far from the path projected in January.",
        "The member judged that, although the trend of improvement in exports concentrated in IT was gradually spreading to non-IT sectors, the trend of recovery in private consumption was not enough to drive well-balanced growth in the overall economy.",
        "The member thus found it still too early to have confidence that there had been a tangible reversal to a positive GDP gap.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had slowed greatly in January, due mainly to the strengthening of the won and declines in prices of livestock products, and that core inflation was also declining significantly, due to the deceleration in price growth in the services sector, particularly in the personal services sector.",
        "The member saw heightened downside risks that this year’s movements of consumer price inflation and core inflation would fall short of the path projected in January, due to the recent slowdown in inflation.",
        "Looking at underlying price movements, meanwhile, the member noted that, although core inflation excluding regulated prices had slowed, this was mainly attributable to non-cyclical factors, such as a freeze in insurance service charges, and business cycle-sensitive prices were maintaining a trend of increase similar to that of the previous month.",
        "The member thus judged that demand-side inflationary pressures were not declining significantly.",
        "Regarding production slack, the member noted that, despite the buoyancy of exports, the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector had declined to hit the lowest level of late, due to sluggish production in the existing leading machinery industries such as automobiles and shipbuilding.",
        "Regarding the labor market, the member’s assessment was that, although the number of persons employed had increased by a greater margin, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors, and the unemployment rate had also remained unchanged year-on-year, the slack in the labor force had increased slightly due to growth in the time and participation gaps.",
        "Looking at financial stability conditions, the member noted that the yield curve in the capital market had steepened, due to a synchronization of domestic long-term interest rates following a large increase in global long-term interest rates.",
        "With respect to the stock market, the member judged that an outflow of foreign portfolio investment had led to a large-scale correction of stock prices and higher price volatility, and in the bond market, the term premium on bonds had risen due to higher preferences for short-term bonds, as well as an inversion of domestic and overseas interest rates.",
        "The member noted that, in the credit market, the slowdown in household lending growth had weakened, due mainly to growth in housing-related credit lending, despite a rise in lending interest rates.",
        "The member thus noted that there was a need to carefully observe the trends of stabilization of household debt, together with future developments in the housing economy.",
        "Based on the results of this examination of real economic activity, price movements and financial stability, the member assessed that, despite recent improvements in economic activity, current economic conditions had not yet reached a level where it could be verified that there were tangible declines in spare capacity in production and labor through the spread of robust and well-balanced growth, and the consequent sustainable rise of demand-side inflationary pressures.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "First of all, the member forecast that underlying inflation would bottom out in the first quarter of this year and rebound afterwards.",
        "The member’s assessment was that personal service fees, sensitive to domestic demand, had been moving close to 2 percent; prices of industrial products, sensitive to global business activities, and those of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, under the influence of exogenous variables, had remained in the mid-1 percent range; and public service charges as well as monthly housing rental payments and housing leasehold deposit prices had remained low, within the 1-percent range.",
        "Taking all these into consideration, the member estimated the current inflation pressures at the mid to upper 1 percent range, somewhat below the target, and expected inflation to near its target if global inflation rose and this led to an increase in industrial product prices.",
        "The member mentioned that this forecast presupposed that continuing domestic demand pressures, albeit weak, would be sustained.",
        "The member also forecast the output gap to remain positive, even if slightly, with exports continuing to grow, consumption maintaining the trend of improvement, facilities investment undergoing a modest adjustment from its high level, and construction investment continuing to go through a correction as expected.",
        "The member noted the need to additionally examine how growth and the price path have been affected by financial imbalances, global economic recovery and structural characteristics of the economy.",
        "Regarding financial imbalances, the member expressed the view that the recent accommodative policy seemed to have caused an unsustainable supply of resources to real estate-related sectors as well as excessive construction investment, and added that accumulated inefficiency of resource allocation would slow down economic activities and weaken inflation pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that Korea’s economic growth would benefit should the global economy continue to improve, for example through global trade channels, and this would lead to a rise in neutral interest rates.",
        "The member went on to state that even if the policy rate was maintained at its current level, there thus remained a possibility of an increase in the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member also pointed out that due to structural problems, such as population aging, capital-intensive technological innovation, the rigid labor market and heightened barriers to entry, the inflation pressures suggested by the Phillips curve seemed to be substantially limited, and went on to argue that while a substantial part of this problem should be solved by structural reform, it was related to financial imbalances and thus was being reflected in monetary policy decision making.",
        "The member presented the view that, with all the above-mentioned factors taken into consideration, there was a need for an interest rate hike in the medium term, but there also existed uncertainties regarding the price path, and went on to argue that thus it would be necessary to adjust the accommodative monetary policy stance while closely watching how Korea’s neutral interest rates move in line with changes in external conditions, conflicts between resolving financial imbalances and boosting domestic demand, as well as the effects of structural reform underway.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at the economic situation since the January 18th Monetary Policy Board meeting, the member mentioned that concerns were raised about the possibility of consumer price inflation deviating from its target, as it had fallen to 1.0 percent in January, with economic sentiment seeming to have withered somewhat due mainly to stock price corrections and long-term interest rate hikes around the globe, the strengthening of US trade protectionist measures and a foreign automaker’s decision to close a factory in Korea.",
        "However, the member’s assessment was that the recent rise in global financial market volatility was attributable to the accelerating growth of the global economy, to growing inflation pressures and to the notion that major countries might normalize their monetary policies faster than originally expected.",
        "The member went on to forecast that, since Korea, as a small open economy heavily dependent on external economic conditions, would be affected by such global growth and price movements, the Korean economy would sustain strong growth at its potential level, as forecast in January.",
        "The member expected inflation to gradually near its target, in line with economic recovery and with a time lag, given that (i) the slowdown in consumer price inflation in January had stemmed largely from non-cyclical factors such as the freezing of insurance premiums and the base effect from agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices, and that (ii) business cycle-sensitive price inflation had registered growth of a little under 2 percent.",
        "With respect to the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets, the member’s assessment was that the volatility of price variables had heightened significantly, but not enough to raise concerns about market unrest.",
        "However, as there remained controversy at home and abroad about whether stocks and some other assets were overvalued, and there remained a possibility of a further hike in market rates, the member argued that it would be necessary to closely monitor market conditions.",
        "The member also stated that, despite the slowing trend of household debt growth, bank lending to households continued to show faster growth than usual in January and credit loans were growing faster than home mortgage loans, and that it would be therefore necessary to remain on the alert and keep an eye on these developments in terms of financial stability risks.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy decision in response, the member stated that, as future growth and inflation were expected to reach the potential and target levels, respectively, and there recently were growing expectations of major countries’ monetary policy normalization, there still remained the need to further adjust the degree of monetary easing.",
        "The member added, however, that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent this time, given the somewhat heightened uncertainty at home and abroad and the fact that more time was required for inflation to converge to the target.",
        "The member went on to argue that attention should be paid to prevent excessive concerns about downside risks from having negative self-fulfilling effects through a contraction in economic sentiment.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level, since inflation pressures, currently requiring more consideration in policy decision-making, had not yet shown signs of materialization.",
        "Looking at the real sector, the member’s assessment was that the real economy had remained close to the growth path forecast in January, driven chiefly by faster recoveries of the global economy and trade.",
        "The member judged that factors contributing to global economic growth that would affect the Korean economy remained favorable overall although the US trade protectionist policies which were taking shape, as seen in the safeguard measures recently coming into effect, were considered as risk factors undermining the global trade environment.",
        "The member also assessed domestic demand as overall being on the path forecast in January, and evaluated that, while facilities investment in the IT sector had been brisk affected by strong semiconductor exports, the slowdown in construction investment had been establishing itself as a trend as expected and the January index had not yet exhibited a clear sign of faster recovery in private consumption.",
        "The member argued for the necessity of closely examining the movements of these real economic factors since February, when factors contributing to consumption growth, such as the Winter Olympic Games and the Lunar New Year holiday, were concentrated.",
        "In terms of supply, the member noted that, although change in the number of persons employed had improved somewhat, rising to previous year-end, this increase had been seen mostly in the agriculture, forestry and fishery and manufacturing sectors.",
        "With this in mind, the member pointed out that the causal chain whereby consumption-led domestic demand recovery sustained growth, which in turn led to employment improvement in the labor market, especially in the services sector, was insufficient.",
        "In terms of inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that, with consumer price inflation registering 1.0 percent and core inflation 1.2 percent in January, continuing decline in inflation as in the second half of last year, had been already projected in the January forecast.",
        "However, the member assessed the degree of the slowdown as somewhat larger than expected, mentioning that factors at work included the effects of a government measure to restrain the price growth of regulated items, as well as the inflation conditions in which domestic demand and employment had not shown full-scale improvement.",
        "Finally, concerning financial stability, the member mentioned that although there had not been any significant changes in the month-to-month trend of household debt and its slowdown was expected to continue, ongoing monitoring was needed of how the upward trend of real estate prices in some regions including Gangnam would affect household debt.",
        "The member also noted that stock market volatility had heightened in countries all around the world in line with the upsurge in US stock market volatility, and went on to state that, given that this phenomenon had been caused by a change in policy projections that the strengthening of the US growth momentum would speed up the US Fed’s policy rate hikes, this phenomenon could be seen as being a result of normal capital flows and price corrections reflecting the shifting perceptions of the real economy.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to strengthen the monitoring of real economic trends, including those of business activities and inflation, as well as the increase in domestic and overseas financial market volatility, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of The member noted that the domestic economy had sustained a modest recovery in line with the favorable global economy, but market sentiment had remained weak.",
        "The member expressed the view that private consumption was expected to recover in February, boosted largely by the Lunar New Year holiday, but more time for observation was needed to judge whether private consumption would continue to recover as originally forecast.",
        "The member also argued that closer examination was needed of changes in exports and employment situations in line chiefly with the recent foreign automaker issue, US trade policy and conditions in shipbuilding and other vulnerable industries, and that attention was needed to be paid to the effects of the government’s real estate policy on construction investment and employment in the construction sector.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had registered a mere 1.0 percent and core inflation had fallen to the lower 1 percent range in January, pointing to a possibility of greater downside risks than originally expected, and also noted a need to keep a watch on whether consumer price inflation would reach 1.5 percent in the first half of this year as forecast in January.",
        "The member judged that this year’s growth rate was unlikely to deviate far from its potential level and the output gap was accordingly unlikely to turn significantly positive, and stressed that it would be necessary for the time being to maintain the accommodative monetary policy and continue to monitor the recovery in private consumption and improvement in employment conditions.",
        "With respect to financial stability conditions, meanwhile, the member took the view that there was a growing need to cope appropriately with the recent rise in global financial market volatility, while at the same time paying attention to the accumulation of financial imbalances due to the accommodative monetary policy so far.",
        "The member noted that there were growing concerns that the stabilization of household debt might be affected negatively if the surge in real estate prices in some areas of Seoul were to spread to other regions, and also other concerns that household debt burdens might increase in line with a fall in housing prices in some regions that had seen a large increase in the housing supply.",
        "The member went on to argue that close examination in cooperation with the government was needed of real estate market conditions and the trend of household debt.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, in the lead-up to the March FOMC meeting where a policy rate hike was highly likely to take place, it would be necessary to closely monitor developments in the international financial markets and to examine how the heightening global financial market volatility would affect emerging market economies.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "acceleration in global economic growth has continued.",
        "Volatility in the global financial markets has increased substantially, with government bond yields rising and stock prices falling in line mainly with strengthening expectations of monetary policy normalizations in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.",
        "has continued, as exports are sustaining their buoyancy and consumption and facilities investment have shown favorable movements, although construction investment has declined.",
        "The trend of improvement in employment conditions appears to have remained moderate, even though the extent of increase in the number of persons employed accelerated in January owing to temporary factors.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "consequence mainly of declines in the prices of livestock products and of a reduction in the extent of increase in personal service fees.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen to the low 1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the low- to mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "expanded considerably, in reflection of global financial market movements.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have risen, stock prices have declined and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, after having previously increased.",
        "Household lending has shown a higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has continued to decline.",
        "Housing sales prices have shown low rates of increase overall, but have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for 2018’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment of the global economy was that recoveries in emerging economies had been strengthening as advanced countries continued to record robust growth, and that global trade had accordingly shown solid growth as well.",
        "Members also evaluated that the global financial markets had remained relatively stable even after the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike last year.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, despite a correction in construction investment, the Korean economy had maintained its modest recovery, with exports remaining strong in line with the global investment expansion and global trade recovery and also with private consumption exhibiting a steady recovery.",
        "Members then raised the growth forecast for this year to 3.0 percent from the figure forecast in October last year and projected the economy to sustain growth at its potential level next year.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had fallen to 1.5 percent during the fourth quarter of last year, somewhat below its target, due to weak agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices and reduced regulated prices, and revised the October 2017 forecast for this year to 1.7 percent.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members stated that the markets had remained stable but attention should be paid to the possibility of a tightening of financial conditions in line with monetary normalization in Bank of Korea website.",
        "Members added that household lending growth, and home mortgage lending growth in particular, had been slowing gradually since the real estate measures announced on August 2[nd] last year, but a close watch should be kept on the trend of household lending while paying attention to the expansion in credit lending and changes in construction cycle.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5 percent this time.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had continued to show a modest recovery, buttressed by the sustained strength of the global economy and solid growth in global trade, and added that the upward adjustment of the GDP growth forecast from that in October last year seemed appropriate.",
        "With the downward adjustment of the inflation outlook, however, the member evaluated that there would be a greater need to keep a closer watch on inflation fluctuations, including on whether demand-side inflation pressures actually materialize.",
        "The member assessed that the output gap seemed to have turned slightly positive but, considering that inflationary pressures were not yet large, it would be necessary to keep the current monetary easing stance for the time being, and went on to state that now seemed the time to closely monitor the real economic trend since the previous Base Rate hike and to analyze whether the current economic recovery would be sustainable in the medium and long term.",
        "The member also stressed that expanding the growth potential seemed even more important now that burdens from accommodative monetary policy had decreased somewhat, and emphasized that research and analysis on the medium- and long-term structural issues concerning the Korean economy should continue.",
        "With respect to financial stability, meanwhile, the member stated that the need to cope with the accumulation of financial imbalances caused by the accommodative monetary policy stance had been one of the major factors taken into account in deciding to raise the Base Rate in November last year.",
        "The member expected the rate hike to have a signalling effect or affect market sentiment, although there would be limitations in addressing household debt with a rate hike, and went on to argue that the central bank should work together with the government to closely examine real estate market conditions and the trend of household debt.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, as Treasury bond yields in advanced countries had surged recently and major countries’ monetary policies might be normalized sooner than originally expected following the Federal Reserve, considering recent remarks of ECB and Bank of Japan which seemed to suggest tightening, it would be necessary to closely monitor domestic and overseas financial markets.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member assessed that the real economy had maintained overall stable growth path, boosted by the sustained recovery of world trade.",
        "The member noted that exports were expected to maintain strong growth this year, leading real economic growth for the time being, while construction investment seemed to have been entering into a correction phase recently and facilities investment, which had grown mainly driven by semiconductor sector, was expected to slow down in 2018 due to a base effect.",
        "The member went on to state that decreasing contributions to domestic demand and growth in line with the slowdown in investment growth were being offset by accelerating growth in private consumption, and added that private consumption was forecast to sustain its recent growth going forward.",
        "However, the member argued that somewhat negative changes had been seen in labor market-related indicators, pointing out that the number of persons employed had been expected to increase by 350,000 in 2017 according to the 2017 October forecasts but had shown actual growth of 320,000.",
        "The member stated that the recent sluggishness in the unemployment and wage growth rates was explainable to some extent, given that in the past the Korean labor market had lagged behind the real economic cycle and that population aging had caused structural changes to the labor market, but the sluggishness in the number of persons employed had come as a bit of surprise, and went on to stress that it would be necessary to closely watch the trend of the number going forward.",
        "The member also mentioned that, in terms of the economic outlook, the growth rate for this year was being revised upward by 0.1 percentage points to 3 percent from the October forecast, and added that the overall growth forecast seemed neutral, as there were upside risks to exports and facilities investment but also downside risks to consumption given the recent employment sluggishness.",
        "In terms of inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that consumer price inflation had slowed to the mid-1-percent range in the fourth quarter last year, due mainly to slowed growth in agricultural and livestock product prices and a fall in city gas bills, and added that, despite real economic growth, the wage growth rate and other labor market indicators had not yet exhibited signs of inflation pressures building up in line with improvement in the output gap.",
        "In reflection of this, this year’s consumer price inflation forecast was revised downward to 1.5 percent for the first half and 1.8 percent for the second half from the October forecasts of 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.",
        "Finally, concerning financial stability, the member mentioned that there was a notable sign that household debt was starting to stabilize.",
        "The member pointed out that household lending by the banking and non-banking sectors had shown far slower growth in December last year than the growth trend over the past couple of years.",
        "Considering that household debt growth had been attributable to the buoyant market for new apartment sales and related group loans, and that household lending rates had been rising and the index of household lending attitudes of financial institutions had tightened, the member stated that the recent stabilization of household debt was expected to continue throughout this year.",
        "The member expressed the view that, taking these points into overall consideration, the real economy had recently maintained overall stable growth, financial stability and household debt in particular had improved, and inflation pressures had not yet shown any sign of materialization, and thus it was appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at economic conditions since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on November 30[th], the member noted that the economic growth rate for last year appeared to be above 3 percent, the growth forecast for this year had been revised slightly upward from 2.9 percent to 3.0 percent, and the growth for next year was projected at 2.9 percent, similar to the potential growth level.",
        "On this basis, the member found Korea’s underlying economic growth trend to be sound.",
        "With respect to inflation conditions, the member saw that consumer price inflation would be running in the low to mid-1 percent range for some time, but since the output gap was shifting into positive territory thanks to a sustained trend of solid growth, the member forecast that consumer price inflation would accelerate and approach its target in the second half of this year.",
        "The member noted that, although the domestic and overseas financial markets were maintaining stability overall, recently concerns had been gradually rising about the possibility that asset prices were overvalued amid protracted accommodative financial conditions around the globe.",
        "The member went on to point out that, if monetary policy normalized further going forward, there would be a greater possibility of sudden price adjustments to risky assets including stocks.",
        "The member commented that household lending, which was considered one of the biggest potential risk factors in the Korean economy, was growing somewhat slowly, mainly led by home mortgage loans, but constant attention should be paid to its trend of increase, as credit lending, which was generally of low credit quality, had expanded, and the increase in household lending was still outpacing income growth.",
        "Next, concerning the monetary policy response, the member stated that maintaining the current degree of monetary accommodation for a long time with Korea’s economic growth remaining at its potential level would constrain the easing of the risk of financial imbalances such as the buildup in household debt.",
        "The member thus found it still effective to make additional adjustment to the degree of monetary accommodation.",
        "The member, however, stated that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current 1.50-percent level this time, given that, with inflation running below the target level, more time was required for inflation to converge to the target, and that there was a need to observe a little longer the impacts of the previous Base Rate hike.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that advanced economies had been maintaining cyclical recoveries centering around investment, thanks for instance to the rebound of sluggish investment, to reinvestment stemming from IT innovation, and to the upgrade of capital goods to respond to increased competition, but if the trend of increased investment slowed, both exports and production were likely to be affected in the future.",
        "In addition, the member saw that the sustainability of consumption was not guaranteed, as household income growth was insufficient due to the low economic participation rate and the declining number of high-quality jobs.",
        "The member added that, as IT-related investment, in particular, would cause job quality in sectors other than capital-intensive new industries to continue to decline, average wages would decrease further, thus possibly leading to a reduction in the share of labor income over the medium term.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, although Korea’s economic growth had been driven by facilities investment related to IT sector exports and by construction investment associated with household debt, the economic recovery had so far not been transmitted fully to household income.",
        "The member judged consumer economic expectations to be better than expected, given that consumption had shown robust growth in the second half of last year, despite slow income growth and a reduction of the fiscal deficit.",
        "The member saw that, although construction investment and facilities investment would likely slow compared to last year, net exports were expected to improve somewhat with the growth of both facilities investment and imports declining.",
        "The member forecast that the government’s expansionary fiscal policy would lead to household income growth, thus driving a continued increase in consumption.",
        "The member, however, added that there still were uncertainties about the demand in advanced economies for imports of non-IT Korean products and about supply-side responses to the government’s policy.",
        "With respect to prices, the member pointed out that the consumer price inflation had fallen to the 1.5-percent level in the fourth quarter of last year due to weak agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices and a cut in regulated prices, but sticky prices, with personal service prices and regulated prices excluded, remained at the 2-percent level.",
        "The member projected that while cyclical inflation would move slightly above their current levels, led by improvements in demand, globally sensitive inflation would hold steady.",
        "The member stated that, although the pace of the accumulation of financial imbalances stemming from monetary accommodation seemed to have eased somewhat, the level of the monetary policy stance should be adjusted in the future while constantly monitoring the trade-off between the achievement of the inflation target and the financial imbalances accumulated thus far.",
        "Finally, the member emphasized that macroeconomic policy seemed to have reached the limit of its effectiveness in further driving up the structurally lowered potential growth rate.",
        "The member thus emphasized the need for market-oriented structural reform to increase the potential growth rate and to strengthen resilience.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level until the trend of economic recovery firms up such that underlying trend of inflation, represented by core inflation, increases to the target.",
        "The member noted that, as most major advanced economies had been showing rapid growth greatly exceeding their potential growth rates, Korea’s exports were recovering, and the Korean economy was also returning to growth around 3%, near its potential growth rate.",
        "The member, however, assessed that, since the export growth was led by some capital-intensive industries including semiconductors, its spillover effects on domestic demand and employment were still limited.",
        "The member commented that construction and facilities investment had entered a correction phase, the trend of recovery in private consumption remained modest, and in the labor market, the increase of private-sector employment was reducing as well.",
        "The member thus assessed the pace of underlying economic recovery to remain modest, and attributed the high growth in the third quarter of last year mostly to a technical phenomenon stemming from the timing of Chuseok holiday.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that it was true that household debt, which had been pointed to as a major risk factor for the Korean economy, still remained high in absolute terms.",
        "The member, however, noted that the need for additional measures to curb household debt seemed to be declining, as household debt growth had been gradually slowing since the implementation of the August 2[nd] measures, and the slower growth was also expected to continue going forward as construction investment underwent an adjustment.",
        "Accordingly, the member stressed the need for maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance until the economy shows solid recovery to ensure that underlying inflation ends its years-long trend of modest decline and increases toward the target level.",
        "The member added that, in order to reverse the trend of decline in inflation, economic growth must exceed its potential level for a certain period, and employment conditions should improve more tangibly as well.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, to this end, it would be desirable to actively utilize the favorable world economic environment, in consideration of the impacts of monetary policy on the exchange rate and the macroeconomy.",
        "One other member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, as the buoyancy of exports stemming from expanded global investment and trade recovery had been continuing, and private consumption was showing a trend of steady improvement, the domestic real economy was sustaining a trend of modest recovery, despite adjustments in facilities and construction investment.",
        "The member estimated the output gap, which had remained negative, to have mostly turned positive, as the annual growth rate had been adjusted upward and the growth path had moved upward slightly, thanks to temporary faster growth in the third quarter of last year.",
        "The member, however, judged the current underlying growth momentum to remain at its potential growth level, in consideration of the slower growth in the fourth quarter, stemming for instance from a base effect.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had been declining greatly, due mainly to supply and regulatory factors such as declines in agricultural product prices and a cut in city gas charges, and forecast that it would be running below the target level for some time, primarily because of a rise in the value of the won, but then would likely accelerate again in the second half, with the impacts of the run-up in commodity prices and increase in the minimum wage being reflected after a time lag.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that core inflation remained flat at the mid-1-percent range despite the trend of economic recovery, and this implied that demand-side inflationary pressures had still not fully strengthened yet, based on core inflation excluding regulated prices and domestic demand inflationary pressure indicators.",
        "Regarding production slack, the member judged the average capacity utilization ratio to have remained low, due to somewhat weaker production growth in the manufacturing sector as a whole apart from some industries, despite the buoyancy of exports.",
        "The member noted that in the labor market as well, the slack in the labor force had increased due to growth in the unemployment, participation, and time gaps on a year-on-year basis.",
        "Accordingly, the member pointed out that, despite gradual improvements in the employment rate, substantial spare capacity continued to remain in the labor force, centered on the youth and those at retirement age.",
        "With respect to financial stability conditions, the member stated that, in the capital market, as medium- and long-term interest rates had risen due mainly to global inflation and changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries, the treasury bond yield curve had steepened, but the corporate bond rates and credit spreads had shown stable movements and foreign portfolio investment had returned to a net inflow, particularly into the stock market.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, with respect to the credit cycle, household credit growth was gradually slowing, with the strengthening of regulations related to household lending and the housing market coming into effect successively.",
        "The member judged that overall financial conditions remained stable, with flows of corporate credit gradually recovering and with economic activity improving.",
        "The member stated that, in overall consideration of the aforementioned real economy, inflation, and financial stability conditions, the output gap was estimated to be shifting into slightly positive territory, but the disappearance of the negative inflation gap was expected to be somewhat delayed due to remaining spare capacity in both production and labor force, and the credit gap was also gradually narrowing, with macroprudential regulations strengthening.",
        "The member noted that, in light of these factors, there was not much need to make an additional adjustment to the degree of monetary accommodation at this time.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has accelerated.",
        "The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example, although government bond rates have risen in line mainly with expectations of monetary policy normalizations in major countries.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism.",
        "- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has improved moderately, although investment has slowed somewhat.",
        "The trend of improvement in employment conditions has slowed, with the increase in the number of persons employed in the service sector having declined for example.",
        "The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to show a pace of GDP growth at the 3% level this year as well.",
        "It expects that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-1% level, in consequence mainly of declines in the extents of increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and of a reduction in gas fees.",

        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "- Although long-term market interest rates have shown a trend of rising, affected by increases in interest rates in major countries, the domestic financial markets have displayed generally stable movements, with stock prices having risen for example, on expectations of improvements in corporate performances.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has continued its downtrend, in line chiefly with the weakening of the US dollar.",
        "The amount of increase in household lending has lessened.",
        "Housing sales prices have shown low rates of increase overall, but have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Economic Outlook for 2018 (revised)’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ assessment of the global economy was that the real economy had maintained favorable improvement based on strong growth and modest inflation, but factors such as the strengthening of US trade protectionism had been working as policy risks to world trade.",
        "Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global financial markets, with major advanced countries adopting diverging monetary policy stances, global financial market volatility had been increasing due to concerns about an escalation of the US-China trade dispute, and that attention needed to be paid to the possibility of tougher financial market conditions in line with the rising cost of raising dollars in the short term.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, despite a continued correction in construction investment, the growth rate of the Korean economy had remained consistent with the pace of potential growth, with private consumption maintaining modest improvement and facilities investment and exports remaining strong.",
        "The members projected the growth rate for this year and next year at 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, as forecast in January this year.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had registered 1.3% in the first quarter of this year, slightly down from the fourth quarter of last year, but was expected to pick up in the second half of this year.",
        "The members adjusted their forecast for consumer price inflation for this year slightly downward from their January forecast to on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "- 2 As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that there had not been any significant capital outflows despite an inversion of the US and Korean policy rates in March, but also mentioned the need to be mindful of the possibility that risk factors might materialize, including the spread of trade protectionism and a decline in global dollar liquidity.",
        "The members also stated that household lending, and lending by the banking sector in particular, had gradually expanded, driven largely by a rise in housing transactions and demand for funds for leasehold deposits in March.",
        "- 3 The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, while the global economy had been favorable overall, domestic and external uncertainties surrounding the Korean economy had expanded, with the impact of the US-China trade dispute following the strengthened US trade protectionism acting as a significant factor heightening international financial market volatility.",
        "The member went on to state that future developments should be closely monitored.",
        "The member noted that both domestic demand and exports had maintained relatively positive growth, in line with the continued favorable conditions of the global economy, and forecast that factors such as the government’s supplementary budget for job creation and its measures to strengthen the income base would further strengthen improvements in private consumption.",
        "The member expressed the view, however, that the employment situation had not shown any improvement, with the March employment indicators worse than originally expected, and added that a close monitoring was needed of the possibility of further difficulties in coping with youth unemployment in line with echo boomers entering the employment market, of the effects of restructuring of foreign automakers and shipbuilders on employment in the manufacturing sector, and of the sluggish employment in the wholesale & retail, food, and lodging industries.",
        "Taking all of this into consideration, the member argued that, - 4 with the output gap remaining positive, boosted by the gradual economic recovery, and the inflation gap remaining negative until now, demand-side inflation pressures had not been high, and stressed that it would be therefore advisable to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy for the time being.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member mentioned that, although household debt had been stable since last year, bank lending to households had exhibited a sharp increase in March.",
        "The member added that it should be examined whether this growth was a transient phenomenon prior to the introduction of regulations on lending and the imposition of heavy transfer taxes, and that real estate market conditions should be closely monitored.",
        "Furthermore, the member took the view that, with the sustained debt growth outpacing income growth, the excessive level of household debt should be taken into consideration when implementing monetary policy, although the burdens on vulnerable households might increase during periods of interest rate hikes.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed that there had not been any significant capital outflows since the inversion of the US and Korean policy rates in March, and that considering Korea’s international credit standing, there was little chance of sudden capital outflows.",
        "However, the member went on to state that market developments should be monitored in consideration of the possibility that, if the US-China trade dispute intensifies or if the US Federal Reserve’s rate hikes negatively affect financial markets in emerging economies, market volatility could rapidly increase.",
        "The member went on to call for intensive research and analysis on how policy rate inversions affected capital flows based on previous cases, both in domestic and overseas markets.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level this time, as the real economy had recently maintained overall stable growth and inflation pressures had not yet materialized.",
        "- 5 Looking at the real sector, the member assessed the real economy as having maintained overall growth at the level forecast earlier this year with the external environment remaining favorable.",
        "The member noted that, although there were increasing policy risks that could deteriorate the global trade environment ─ the US government’s trade protectionist stance had strengthened and the US-China trade dispute had begun ─ the global trade volume had sustained its strong growth since last year, and Korea’s exports had continued to show corresponding growth.",
        "The member stated that Korea’s goods export growth, having outpaced global trade growth, had recorded 3.8 percent last year in terms of volume, lower than the global trade growth of 4.6 percent, suggesting a possibility of structural changes in the competitiveness of export industries.",
        "However, the member went on to state that goods exports this year were expected to hold steady at a level similar to that in the previous year and contribute to economic growth, assuming that global trade growth would remain in the 4-percent range this year and the export competitiveness of the manufacturing sector would remain at last year’s level.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, meanwhile, the member presented the view that what was most remarkable was that private consumption had shown a clearly marked recovery while facilities investment had expanded, particularly in the IT sector, and construction investment had been going through a correction phase, as forecast.",
        "The member added that, considering the consumption trend during the past year, including the current projection that private consumption would continue to exceed 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, the time had come to consider that the sluggishness of consumption that had lasted from 2012 through 2016 was now about to be resolved.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that the faster growth in private consumption had not yet been seen to facilitate production in domestic demand-oriented industries represented by services industry and to improve employment in related labor markets.",
        "The member presented the view that the discrepancy between the consumption trend on the one hand, and those - 6 of production and employment on the other, seemed substantially attributable to the sharp decline in the number of Chinese tourists over the same period and to the fact that a substantial part of household consumption growth over the last year had been accounted for by an increase in overseas consumption.",
        "The member’s evaluation was that the former might be resolved depending on changes in political conditions and the latter might have been affected by the strong Korean won, although the possibility could not be ruled out of it being a structural phenomenon caused in part by a lack of international competitiveness in the domestic services industry.",
        "The member mentioned that, as a result, inflation had continued to show an unclear upward trend and had somewhat declined in the first quarter of this year on year-over-year basis, with consumer price inflation standing at 1.3 percent and core inflation, excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, at 1.2 percent, compared to those in the fourth quarter of last year.",
        "The member expected inflation to exhibit faster growth toward the second half of this year, driven mainly by the accumulation of the positive output gap, the effects of minimum wage hikes causing prices to increase, and rising inflation in major economies around the world, and went on to state that, due to the many risk factors surrounding inflation, now was not the right time to make a monetary policy decision based on a prejudgment about the pace of inflation.",
        "Next, the member noted that, with the recent inversion of the US and Korean policy rates, some had raised concerns about possible capital outflows and had pointed to a need for policy responses; but considering the fact that Korea’s potential growth rate had been declining due to population aging and that the US economy had been showing more marked improvements in the labor market and a clearer accumulation of inflation pressures, the member evaluated that the current policy rate inversion could be seen as a natural phenomenon reflecting macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the member stated that the normal capital outflows and depreciation pressure on the Korean won that would be caused by the - 7 inversion was expected to facilitate the buildup of inflation pressures and thus help the economy to return rapidly to its equilibrium path.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at economic conditions since the Monetary Policy Board meeting on February 27th, the member noted that there had been growing concern about economic conditions of late, due mainly to the US-China trade dispute and heightened volatility in the financial and foreign exchange markets, ongoing restructuring at some companies, and sluggish employment indicators.",
        "The member, however, stated that in the April economic outlook, the growth rate for this year and next remained unchanged at 3.0 percent and 2.9 percent.",
        "On the inflation front, the member expressed the opinion that, although the outlook for this year’s consumer price inflation was revised slightly downward from 1.7 percent to 1.6 percent, there was no change in the expectation that it would approach its target level of 2.0 percent in the medium term.",
        "The member added that this expectation was supported by large spillover effect on inflation, and in business cycle-sensitive price indexes, which reflect demand pressures; and (ii) the fact that the rate of inflation expected by the general public had held steady in the mid-2 percent range.",
        "The member presented the view that, in the domestic and international financial markets, concerns about spreading protectionism had brought about heightened volatility in price variables such as interest rates, stock prices and the exchange rate, and that the pace of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and developments in the US-China trade dispute might cause greater volatility.",
        "The member also noted that there had not been a trend of capital outflows, even though the US policy rate had surpassed - 8 that of Korea.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that it was necessary to take into account the possibility of capital outflow risks materializing due to other risk factors, such as policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and spreading protectionism.",
        "The member stated that, although household lending growth itself was slowing somewhat, it had still been high in March, led by the banking sector, and there still remained demand for credit loans and leasehold deposit loans as more households moved into newly constructed houses.",
        "The member thus asked that attention be paid to financial stability risks.",
        "With respect to the corresponding monetary policy direction, the member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, considering that uncertainties surrounding domestic and international economic conditions were still high and further tightening was not urgently needed in terms of inflation.",
        "However, the member noted that, if growth and price movements were judged not to diverge greatly from the current forecasts, the Board should raise the Base Rate further at the proper time so as to prevent the degree of monetary policy accommodation from increasing relative to growth.",
        "The member stated that doing so would prevent greater risks to financial stability while ensuring space for monetary policy in the longer term.",
        "One member meanwhile expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that secular inflationary pressures and the possibility of the spread of financial imbalances had been examined at this meeting to assess the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance.",
        "First, on the inflation front, the member presented the view that the upward momentum seemed to have been maintained.",
        "The member assessed that, although the rate of increase in housing rents continued to decline, underlying price movements, excluding regulatory prices and temporary factors, were approaching 2 percent, - 9 given somewhat faster-than-expected price increases in agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and personal service items.",
        "The member added that, although domestic demand pressures leading inflation were forecast to remain steady going forward, there remained downside risks as well with respect to exports, since improvements led by semiconductors had not had sufficient spillover effects on other items.",
        "Looking at the aforementioned factors, the member judged that, if the current monetary policy stance remained unchanged, inflationary pressures — albeit weak — would be sustained, and the inflation target would be achieved over the medium term.",
        "With respect to financial imbalances, the member emphasized the inefficient allocation of resources stemming from population aging, and pointed out that, while for major OECD countries, the average household net savings rate had remained in the 6-percent range and household debt-to-disposable income ratio at the 140-percent level during 2012-2016, the household net savings rate in Korea had risen by 5.4 percentage points, from ratio had increased by 20 percentage points, from 150 percent to 170 percent during the same period.",
        "The member stated that net household assets relative to GDP in Korea were falling below the OECD average, and the pace of population aging was likely to be twice the OECD average in the future.",
        "Given this situation, the member saw it as natural for households to devote efforts to increase their net assets, and expected such efforts would continue.",
        "The member went on to mention that, viewed in this context, the surge in household debt and boom in housing construction could be seen as efforts by households to increase their net asset values in the current low interest rate environment.",
        "The member pointed out that, therefore, if the accommodative monetary policy stance were maintained, even if real estate-related regulations were to ease the trend of increase in the real estate market, price increases in other financial and real assets could be induced due to a balloon effect.",
        "The member presented the view that, with all the aforementioned factors taken into overall consideration, there was a need to somewhat - 10 taper off the accommodative stance, but it would be necessary to adjust the accommodative monetary policy stance in the future while closely watching the future price path, examining whether the neutral interest rate would be adjusted upward in line with changes in external conditions, and monitoring the results of structural reform.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the domestic real economy had maintained a trend of growth conforming to the pace of potential growth, as private consumption continued to show gradual improvement, and facilities investment and exports remained buoyant, which together offset a continued correction in construction investment.",
        "However, the member noted that, despite continued strong international demand, the trend of improvement in household consumption had been less than robust due mainly to an increase in precautionary savings, and the domestic demand transmission channel of growth had been restricted, owing for instance to a rigid market structure.",
        "The member thus pointed out that the base of economic recovery had not been expanded.",
        "In terms of inflation, the member noted that, with the consumer price uptrend slowing in the first quarter, the future trajectory of annual inflation had been adjusted slightly downward.",
        "The member stated that prices had sustained their low upward trend, led by industrial products, despite the impacts of an increase in the minimum wage.",
        "The member went on to expect consumer price inflation to continue to run below the inflation target for some time, influenced for instance by a rise in the value of the won and the stabilization of oil prices.",
        "The member saw that as core inflation had slowed this year, due mainly to non-cyclical factors, the timing for the originally expected rebound was being pushed back.",
        "The member commented that core inflation was likely to accelerate - 11 gradually in reflection of the economic recovery and the effects of the minimum wage increase, but there remained constraining factors such as a lack of improvement in labor market conditions, and downward pressures on rents stemming from increased supplies of housing and commercial buildings.",
        "The member thus presented the view that core inflation was estimated to be increasing modestly.",
        "With respect to production sector slack, the member noted that manufacturing production had been sluggish in the fourth quarter of 2017 but had recently recovered, led by the IT sector, and the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector had rebounded slightly, after having remained on a trend of decline.",
        "The member’s assessment, however, was that the overall trend of improvement in production sector slack was slight, due to the sustained sluggishness of production in some non-IT industries.",
        "The member added that the sluggishness in the labor market seen in the preceding month had continued with the decrease in the number of persons employed in the wholesale & retail and education services sectors, and that the slack in the labor market had continued to expand, with the unemployment, time and participation gaps all increasing.",
        "Next, in terms of financial stability conditions, the member stated that yield curves in the capital market had flattened, as the stabilization of global long-term interest rates brought down domestic long-term interest rates as well.",
        "The member saw that, with volatility in the stock market heightening due to concerns about the escalation of the US-China trade dispute, inflows of foreign securities investment had dropped, but the foreign currency money markets had been stable, as shown in CDS premiums.",
        "The member commented that, in the credit market, household lending had shown steady growth, led by the banking sector, due mainly to an increase in housing transactions and demand for funds for housing leasehold deposits, which had offset the government’s implementation of prudential regulations and financial institutions’ strengthening of their lending standards.",
        "The member stated that lending to the corporate sector - 12 had also continued to grow, led by loans to sole proprietors.",
        "The member stated that, in overall consideration of the aforementioned real economy, inflation, and financial stability conditions, the current economic conditions had not yet reached a level where it could be verified that a trend of well-balanced and solidly based recovery had taken root so as to support tangible declines in production sector and labor market slack and to back up a sustainable rise of inflationary pressures, with uncertainties regarding the growth and price paths increasing, due mainly to the trade dispute between the US and China and heightened volatility in the FX and financial markets.",
        "One other member expressed the need to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance so as to allow the domestic demand recovery to firm up, thus ensuring that consumer price inflation converges gradually to the target.",
        "The member noted that the Korean economy was maintaining growth of about 3 percent, thanks to increased export demand in line with sustained economic recovery in major advanced countries.",
        "The member pointed out, however, that this growth trend was concentrated in some capital-intensive export industries and thus had continued to have only limited spillover effects on the overall economy, including on domestic demand, employment and prices.",
        "The member also noted that a lack of demand for domestic consumer goods and services, stemming from a surge in overseas spending and a decline in the number of foreign tourists, was a major factor behind the slower growth in the number of persons employed.",
        "The member’s assessment was that this, together with the stronger won, had caused overall price inflation to remain low, despite a cost-side shock from the increase in the minimum wage.",
        "The member meanwhile stated that international financial market volatility had partially expanded in line with rate hikes in the US and the escalating trade dispute between the US and China.",
        "On the domestic front, - 13 the member went on to state that the issue of restructuring at some ailing large corporations had surfaced and that there was a growing likelikehood that the trend of slower household debt growth would continue as housing cycle was entering a correction phase.",
        "The member thus expected concerns about negative side effects from accommodative monetary policy to weaken gradually.",
        "Accordingly, the member stated the view that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent, while watching to see if labor market conditions would improve and price inflation would show an upward trend through a recovery in domestic demand.",
        "The member, meanwhile, added that a shock to capital flows stemming from an inversion of the US and Korean policy rates would likely be absorbed smoothly through flexible exchange rate adjustments based on Korea’s favorable external soundness, including current account surplus and ample foreign reserves, accumulated for about last 20 years.",
        "- 14 Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economy has continued its robust growth.",
        "The global financial markets have shown high levels of volatility, with government bond yields and stock prices falling in line mainly with concerns about the worsening trade relations between the US and China.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.",
        "has continued, as exports are sustaining their buoyancy and consumption and facilities investment have shown favorable movements.",
        "The recovery in employment conditions has slowed, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, due in large part to - 15 improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "due mainly to declines in the prices of livestock products and a slowdown in the pace of increase in petroleum product prices.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been in the low- to mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year.",
        "For the year overall consumer price inflation is expected to be slightly below the level projected in January (1.7%).",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "in reflection of global financial market movements.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have fallen under the effects chiefly of changes in government bond yields in major countries.",
        "Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated considerably in line mainly with concerns about spreading trade protectionism and with the decline in risks related to North Korea.",
        "Household lending has shown a higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has continued to decline.",
        "The paces of increase in housing sales prices have slowed, especially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer - 16 price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on “Recent Economic Developments,” “FX and International Finance” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, despite slower growth in emerging market economies (EMEs), the global economy had continued to show strong growth, led for instance by the buoyancy of the US economy.",
        "Members also mentioned that volatility could heighten in the global financial markets, as the US-China trade dispute continued, concerns about spreading financial unrest in Turkey and some other EMEs had grown, and the monetary policy normalization of the US Federal Reserve was likely to continue.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that it was continuing to grow at its potential level with the steady growth of private consumption and exports, although facilities and construction investment had been going through corrections.",
        "Members, however, noted that it was necessary to keep a close eye on heightened downside risks stemming for instance from the US-China trade dispute, financial unrest in EMEs, and worsening employment sluggishness.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had remained in the mid-1% range, and core inflation had slowed to the 1% range.",
        "Members expected the price path to be lowered slightly from the July path forecast.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that they had shown a stable trend overall, despite expanded volatility in the international financial markets due mainly to the US-China trade dispute the Bank of Korea website.",
        "and financial unrest in EMEs.",
        "Members saw that, although household lending growth had been slowing, attention should be paid to the continued strong growth in sole proprietor loans.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting.",
        "The member noted that monetary policy had to be considered within the framework of the global economic outlook, effective utilization of limited policy space, and harmony with other macroeconomic policies, with the goal of minimizing volatility and the width of the inflation gap from a medium- to long-term perspective.",
        "First, the member assessed that with respect to the economic situation in Korea, growth seemed to be anchored at the upper-2% range, lower than in the past.",
        "The member noted that the potential growth path in Korea still seemed to be going through a correction due to ongoing structural changes, such as a decline in the domestic labor force and a shift into a new global trade order, emphasizing that this could not be easily distinguished from cyclical fluctuations.",
        "In this regard, the member saw that the Korean economy was likely to be more influenced by cyclical fluctuations of the global economy, rather than by domestic factors.",
        "On the domestic front, the member expected downward pressures on consumption stemming from sluggish employment and income polarization would be offset to some extent by solid growth in total wages.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that, on the external front, if the global economy, which had peaked, entered into an economic downturn, this, together with effects from a reduction in dollar liquidity, could weigh cyclically on growth.",
        "Next, with respect to the inflation gap and financial imbalances, the member noted that (i) the price index with administered items excluded, which was a better indicator of demand pressures than the CPI, had already been fluctuating at around its target for months; (ii) inflation expectations among the general public had also remained at the mid-2% range; and (iii) the forecasts of corporations (an important link with the real economy) for consumer prices and for the rate of increase in their product prices seemed to show movements similar to these expectations.",
        "The member also noted that the GDP gap was forecast to be positive, albeit slightly, and inflation in OECD countries were projected to be revised upward.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member expected that, absent any additional shock, consumer price inflation would gradually near its target.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that if a judgement is made to maintain domestic demand pressures, which are slightly above potential growth, in consideration only of the current inflation gap, the resulting deepened financial imbalances would lead to the widening of the mid-term inflation gap due to difficulties in responding to cyclical downward pressures, and more policy space and time would be needed to narrow the inflation gap.",
        "The member saw that financial imbalances had been continuing to build up under the current easing stance, pointing out that non-bank sole proprietor loans had been on the rise, that real estate investment was not leading to sustainable income, and that Korea’s household leverage compared to income was very high internationally and had been continuing to increase.",
        "In this regard, the member’s judgment was that, from the perspective of policy coordination, it would be desirable to improve the efficiency of resource distribution and to maintain appropriate incentives for investment by slightly reducing monetary policy easing at this point in time when demand pressures were driven by an expansionary fiscal policy to provide income support for vulnerable groups.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, while continuing to observe future economic developments.",
        "First, looking at recent economic conditions in consideration of changes in circumstances since the previous MPB meeting, the member saw that, on the growth front, the economy was judged to maintain growth at its potential level thanks to steady growth in consumption and exports, despite corrections in facilities and construction investment.",
        "The member also noted that economic sentiment had weakened considerably, due to growing concerns about downside risks stemming for instance from the US-China trade dispute, financial unrest in EMEs and the deepened employment sluggishness.",
        "The member, however, commented that economic agents seemed to have responded somewhat excessively given the coexistence of upside risks, such as fiscal expansion to support job creation and income, government policy measures including a cut in the individual consumption tax, and major large corporations’ plans to expand their investment.",
        "The member went on to express the view that the excessive weakening of sentiment might amplify adverse effects through a self-realization process, and thus a careful watch needed to be kept in this regard.",
        "In terms of prices, the member expected the price path to be lowered slightly from the July forecast.",
        "The member, however, assessed this to be largely attributable not to demand factors but to policy factors, which include the government’s welfare policy measures, such as an increase in public heath care benefit coverage, an expansion of free school meals, and temporary cuts in the individual consumption tax and electricity fees.",
        "Accordingly, the member anticipated that, although inflation would approach the target somewhat more slowly and reach it somewhat later, the upward movement of inflation toward the target was likely to remain unchanged.",
        "The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that if inflation diverged from its target due to reasons other than demand factors, it would be desirable to further increase the degree of flexibility in operating monetary policy under the inflation targeting regime.",
        "In terms of domestic and international financial and foreign exchange markets, the member’s assessment was that these markets had generally remained stable, despite heightened volatility in the international financial markets due mainly to the US-China trade dispute and financial unrest in EMEs.",
        "In particular, the member commented that growth of monetary aggregates such as M2 and Lf had been on the rise, as funding to corporations had expanded thanks to improved sales performances and the easing of credit risk aversion, and as household and sole proprietor loans had also been increasing steadily.",
        "In addition, the member stressed the need for paying attention to the possibility that these financial easing conditions could work to build up the risk of financial imbalances, as could be seen in the recent growth in credit related to real estate and the run-up in real estate prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region.",
        "Concerning the monetary policy response, the member’s assessment was that, taking current growth, inflation and financial conditions into overall consideration, it was necessary to somewhat reduce the degree of monetary easing from the current level through an increase in the Base Rate, focusing on the risk of financial imbalances rather than the risk of macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "The member, however, judged that, given the high uncertainties over external conditions such as the US-China trade dispute and financial unrest in EMEs, and the significant weakening of economic sentiment stemming for instance from more sluggish-than-expected employment indicators in July, a raise in the Base rate at this meeting could have unintended negative effects.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period while examining closely the real economic trend as seen in economic activities, employment and inflation and also constantly monitoring financial stability conditions.",
        "The member evaluated that the global economy had maintained overall growth, boosted chiefly by the strong US economy.",
        "However, the member also mentioned a possibility of greater international financial market volatility due to the sustained US-China trade dispute, growing concerns about the spread of financial instability in Turkey and some other EMEs, and the prospect of continued monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member went on to argue that if the US carried out trade protectionist measures as it had already signalled, it would be necessary to closely monitor how these measures would affect the Korean economy.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member did not expect growth to deviate far from the level forecast in July.",
        "The member noted that, although private consumption had remained stable and exports had been strong as originally expected, the recent employment sluggishness might restrict private consumption, and facilities and construction investment had been going through corrections, which taken together increased concerns about the real economy as a whole.",
        "The member added that it would be very important to analyze the cyclical, structural and policy factors behind the investment and employment sluggishness.",
        "The member emphasized that, since inflation was likely to remain lower than originally forecast in July, a close analysis of inflation should be made for the second half of this year and for the first half of next year.",
        "The member noted that, under these real economic conditions, many had pointed not to short-term cyclical factors but rather to structural and policy factors, including the gradually weakening competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, as largely responsible for the recent economic difficulties, and thus the member took the view that more efforts should be made to improve economic fundamentals in the medium and long term.",
        "However, the member also judged that, since cyclical factors might have also contributed to the sluggish employment and below-target inflation, it would be necessary to develop monetary policy to cope with short-term economic fluctuations, while considering whether growth would deviate far from its potential level and whether consumer price inflation would gradually approach its target level from the fourth quarter of this year.",
        "In this regard, the member evaluated that more time should be taken to monitor movements of macroeconomic indicators while holding the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, although household debt was expected to remain stable in the second half of this year, largely due to the effects of government measures, more careful attention should be paid to financial stability when making monetary policy decisions at a time when the economy was faced with household debt growth that had continued for several years in the low interest rate environment and with real estate price hikes in some regions.",
        "Finally, the member noted that, although there was not much likelihood of financial instability in some EMEs spreading to other EMEs, close examination of international financial market developments should be maintained, while considering the continued rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and the possibility of the US strengthening its trade protectionist measures, for example through its dispute with China.",
        "One member, meanwhile, expressed the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level and take more time to observe future changes in domestic and external economic conditions.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the global economy had maintained strong growth and the trade volume had remained large overall despite the rise of trade protectionism and financial instability in vulnerable EMEs, and that upside and downside risks to the future growth path had balanced out each other.",
        "The member evaluated that tighter credit conditions had been seen mostly in EMEs whose current accounts had shifted to deficits, and EMEs, unlike the US and some other advanced countries, had seen slower growth, but the member added that it was good to see countries with favorable external soundness announcing modest stimulus measures.",
        "The member assessed that the domestic economy had maintained growth consistent with the potential growth rate in the first half of this year, but the gap between exports and domestic demand had been widening and uncertainty surrounding the future growth path had increased somewhat.",
        "The member estimated that exports had been maintaining strong growth overall.",
        "More specifically, the member added that the outlook for robust export volume growth was supported by its month-on-month rebound as well as by the partial spread of export improvement, which had been concentrated in the IT sector, to non-IT sectors.",
        "The member’s judgment was that the total value of customs-cleared exports had exhibited slower growth, but this had been due mainly to semiconductor prices entering a correction phase, and the member added that, considering past examples and the global trade and demand conditions, customs-cleared export growth was highly likely to gradually stabilize.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, meanwhile, the member assessed that its correction phase had been lengthened and major indicators related to the growth path for the second half of the year had been falling short of original forecasts, and went on to point out that employment had remained sluggish since the end of last year owing to structural, policy and cyclical factors.",
        "The member estimated that households’ consumption capacities had been gradually improving, with total wages maintaining a sharp increase and with household income growth exceeding its average for the past two to three years, but corporate and consumer sentiment indexes had been declining.",
        "And thus the member mentioned that considerable attention should be paid to assessing the degree to which labor market policy was affecting consumption and to judging whether incomes were continuing to improve.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that the details of measures to revitalize domestic demand, including temporary individual consumption tax cuts, were still in a state of flux, but they were a positive factor for the domestic demand outlook.",
        "With regard to inflation, the member noted that consumer price inflation had maintained growth at around the mid-1 percent level and core inflation had slowed to the 1 percent level, both coming in slightly below the original forecasts, but if irregular factors, policy effects, and base effects were counted out, it would be difficult to rule out the possibility of inflationary pressures remaining higher than what had been suggested by the headline indexes.",
        "The member went on to state that attention should be paid to the possibility of consumer price inflation approaching its target more rapidly if cost factors, such as administered prices, that had limited inflation for several years became neutral or shifted to an increase and if the output gap remained positive.",
        "The member also expressed the view that constant monitoring and estimation of the underlying trend of inflationary pressures were important considerations in determining the level of the Base Rate that would be consistent with the medium-term inflation trend.",
        "Finally, as to financial stability, the member mentioned that attention was being paid to the fact that household lending had been growing at a slower pace, but risk factors remained and loans to sole proprietors with relatively short maturities had continued to grow rapidly.",
        "Looking at the financial markets, the member took the view that, as the US was expected to continue its rate hikes, and trade conflicts among major countries and financial conditions in EMEs had been working to destabilize the financial markets, it would be necessary to continuously monitor the possibility of a spread of related risks.",
        "Another member took the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level this time.",
        "On the external front, the member noted that the possibility that US-China trade dispute would protract could not be ruled out, and concerns about real economic slowdown in China had been spreading, with its industrial production growth rate for July lower than usual amid heightened yuan volatility and declines in investment and consumption indicators.",
        "Looking at the US economy, meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that, with consumption, investment and exports all showing buoyancy, the US seemed to be enjoying a booming economy─the growth rate had stood at 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and consumer price inflation had risen to 2.9 percent in July, and thanks to all this the global economy and trade were not showing any signs of slowdown.",
        "On the domestic front, the member judged that there had been negative indicators, with construction and facilities investment continuing to go through corrections and consumer sentiment worsening, but private consumption had maintained modest growth, sustaining domestic demand.",
        "The member also mentioned that employment sluggishness had been worsening since the end of last year, with change in the number of persons employed falling to 5,000 in July due to the accelerating decline in employment in traditional services industries, including wholesale & retail and lodging & restaurants, and to the continued sharp reduction in employment in some manufacturing industries.",
        "The member added that wages, meanwhile, had sustained robust growth, accelerating month on month in May.",
        "The member added that the income distribution among households based on their participation in the labor market might experience negative effects from the conflicting trends of employment sluggishness and wage improvement, but as they offset each other, there remained uncertainties in terms of total household consumption.",
        "The member stated that thus it was difficult to conclude that future household consumption growth would be negatively impacted.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that in July consumer price inflation had remained unchanged from the second quarter at 1.5 percent and core inflation had fallen to 1 percent compared to the second quarter.",
        "And the member evaluated that, despite the sustained positive output gap and the accelerating wage growth, inflation had not been showing a clear upward trend.",
        "The member expressed the view that this low inflation trend had been attributable not only to the two factors pointed out at the previous meeting─domestic demand growth had been modest, and not strong enough to build up underlying inflationary pressures, and inflation expectations might have declined somewhat in line with the low inflation that had persisted for a considerable period of time since 2012─but also to other complementary factors.",
        "In line with this, the member pointed out that theoretically the US rate hikes would be expected to trigger normal capital outflows, depreciate the Korean won and give rise to inflationary pressures, but thanks to Korea’s heightened international credit standing, the US rate hikes and financial instability in some EMEs had encouraged foreign capital to flow into the Korean bond market.",
        "The member also argued that any adjustments to the Base Rate going forward should be in the upward direction, considering the fact that a small but positive output gap had been sustained and that the neutral interest rate had risen since the second half of last year, as the decline in export demand in accordance with the sharp decrease in global trade between 2012 and 2015 had been substantially resolved and the decline in consumption demand caused by shocks from the weakening of households’ propensities to consume had somewhat eased.",
        "However, the member’s evaluation was that the timing of a Base Rate hike should be determined while monitoring the pace of growth in inflation in order to be true to the purpose of inflation targeting─controlling inflation expectations─since inflation had remained low and there remained large uncertainties, despite the real economy growing at or slightly above its potential.",
        "One other member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level to serve as a buffer against the gradually increasing downside risks to the macroeconomy.",
        "The member’s assessment was that the Korean economy had been sustaining growth at around its potential rate until the second quarter, boosted by the global economic boom and increased semiconductor demand, but the economy was expected to face gradually increasing downside risks from the second half of this year.",
        "The member mentioned that exports had remained relatively favorable in July and August, but the possibility could not be ruled out of the growth gradually slowing down going forward in line chiefly with the strengthening of trade protectionism, the possibility of a Chinese economic slowdown and the easing of the sharp increase in global semiconductor demand that had led export growth.",
        "The member pointed out that the economy had also been burdened by a rapid deterioration of the terms of trade, and noted that added value created through trade had been decreasing, with growth in import prices outpacing that in export prices, implying that, despite favorable export growth, the national purchasing power that could sustain consumption and investment had not been growing as rapidly as GDP.",
        "The member went on to state that this slowing growth in purchasing power in line with the worsening terms of trade suggested increasing downside risks to domestic demand.",
        "The member expressed the view that construction investment had already entered a correction phase in trend, that facilities investment, having shifted to a sharp decline in the second quarter, was unlikely to rebound soon, and that it would be difficult to expect private consumption, having contributed significantly to supporting domestic demand for the past year, to grow more rapidly from the second half of the year.",
        "The member assessed that, considering the rapid slowdown in change in the number of persons employed while wages had increased at a faster pace than usual, as well as the worsening sluggishness of self-employed businesses, it would be difficult to expect overall household income, including business income, to help accelerate private consumption growth enough to expand domestic demand as a whole.",
        "The member also commented that the recent and relatively rapid decline in the consumer sentiment index could be understood as representing changed conditions, making it hard to stay optimistic about the prospects for private consumption from the second half of this year.",
        "The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that, despite cost-side inflationary pressures, such as higher oil prices and a sharp increase in the minimum wage, consumer price inflation had remained in the mid-1 percent range and core inflation had fallen to 1.0 percent, in contrast to the global reflation trend, and went on to state that this implied that the aggregate demand of the Korean economy was sluggish.",
        "The member also argued that inflation was unlikely to rebound quickly given the limited prospects for an expansion of domestic demand going forward.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this time to serve as a buffer against downside risks to economic activities and inflation.",
        "The member also expressed the view that the widening gap between US and Korean interest rates that might arise as a result, as well as the consequent capital flows and exchange rate fluctuations, should be understood as natural consequences reflecting the gap between the US and Korean macroeconomic situations.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point raise.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "global economy has continued its robust growth.",
        "In the global financial markets, some emerging market economies with weak external soundness have seen unease again, including capital outflows and sharp depreciations of their currencies.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.",
        "has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted.",
        "Employment conditions have become more sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened significantly.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in July and sustain a rate at its potential level.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "increases in service fees and agricultural product prices have slowed, despite the accelerating pace of increase in the prices of petroleum products.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen to the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "market interest rates have fallen, affected by the financial unease in some emerging market economies and the sluggishness of employment.",
        "Stock prices had declined, due mainly to concerns about the US-China trade dispute, but have since rebounded as these concerns have eased somewhat.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in line with changes in the value of the dollar globally.",
        "Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat.",
        "Housing sales prices have remained steady overall, but have risen rapidly in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "□ Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks.",
        "After briefings by staff on “Economic Outlook for the Second Half of discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that the global economy had continued to show moderate growth on the whole, with emerging market economies(EMEs) generally improving and the US economy sustaining its robust growth.",
        "Members also mentioned that there had been growing concerns in the global financial markets, as Asian emerging market countries had seen declining stock prices and depreciating currencies and had experienced foreign capital outflows in consequence of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that facilities and construction investment had continued to go through a correction, private consumption and exports had sustained relatively favorable movements, and government spending had increased rapidly.",
        "The growth forecasts for this year and next year were lowered by 0.1 percentage point each to 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in reflection of downside risks such as the escalating trade dispute between the US and China and continued employment sluggishness.",
        "Concerning inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen slightly and core inflation had remained in the low-1% range in the second quarter.",
        "And in comprehensive consideration of increases in oil prices and the exchange rate and a slowdown in growth of administered prices due to an expansion in welfare policy including education and medical services, consumer price inflation was forecast at 1.6 percent for are posted on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "this year and 1.9 percent for next year.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members assessed that price variable volatility, although having increased due to concerns about a spread of trade frictions, would have only limited impacts, and went on to state that attention needed to be paid to the possibility of an escalation of the US-China trade dispute.",
        "The members stressed that, despite a slowdown in household debt growth, it would be necessary to constantly examine growth in loans such as leasehold deposit loans and loans to sole proprietors.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member took the view that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent at this meeting, as the time had come to somewhat reduce the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "The member noted that, although the global economy had maintained modest growth, there had been growing preference for safe haven assets due to the prolongation of the recent trade dispute, and global supply chains had begun to show signs of structural changes.",
        "The member added that the repercussions of the trade conflict were likely to be limited to financial markets in the short term, but if the dispute intensified, Korea’s exports would be affected both directly and indirectly, and the long-term results would be hard to predict as production bases were relocated.",
        "The member assessed domestic real economic fundamentals as being overall similar to those previously forecast.",
        "The member noted that consumption had continued to show gradual improvement and construction investment had been going through a correction as originally forecast, while IT investment, concentrated among some corporations, had exhibited weak growth and was likely to fall below the level originally forecast.",
        "The member, however, argued that the Korean economy, boosted by an expansionary fiscal policy, was expected to continue to remain slightly above its potential growth level.",
        "The member evaluated, meanwhile, that the recent rapid decline in the working-age population aged 15 to 59, combined with the fall in the average working hours, had reduced total labor supply, and in the process of coping with this, corporations had raised wages and reduced changes in the number of persons employed, which had resulted in a decrease in the rate of increase in total working hours and an increase in the rate of total wage growth from January to May this year.",
        "The member’s assessment was that consumer price inflation had remained flat at the mid-1% level, but when excluding the prices of administered items currently exhibiting negative growth, inflation was seen to have already exceeded its target.",
        "The member forecast consumer price inflation to decline temporarily in the third quarter due to a base effect and then gradually move near its target, considering that personal service prices, which were driving consumer price inflation, had remained in the mid-2% range and that oil prices and prices of items affected by the global economic recovery were expected to rise.",
        "Meanwhile, the member’s judgment was that the expansion in financial liabilities resulting from the sustained accommodative monetary policy stance was materializing as risks to the real economy, such as excessive business investment in real estate sector, and vacancy risks from oversupply of housing.",
        "The member also assessed that returns from inefficient leveraged investment had not led to sustainable revenues, which had been gradually increasing deadweight loss in the Korean economy.",
        "The member added that a balloon effect, in which considerable liquidity had been flowing into less-regulated sectors, still existed while real estate risks had been somewhat controlled by various measures taken by the policy authorities.",
        "In this regard, the member’s judgment was that widening financial imbalances could be curbed to some extent by making a slight upward adjustment of the Base Rate toward the neutral interest rate at this point in time when inflation was forecast to near its target in the medium term.",
        "The member also took the view that the burdens placed on vulnerable groups by a rate hike could be addressed more effectively with government policy measures implemented at a micro level.",
        "Another member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period, stating that more time was needed to monitor trends of economic conditions, employment and inflation as well as changes in external conditions.",
        "The member expressed the view that, although the global economy had overall maintained favorable growth and global trade had rebounded in the second quarter, uncertainties had increased, since, from the second half of this year, the repercussions of the US-China trade dispute were likely to increase more than originally expected and the US Federal Reserve was forecast to continue to normalize its monetary policy in line with the sustained US economic growth.",
        "Looking at the domestic economy, the member noted that employment had been sluggish and facilities and construction investment had been going through corrections while private consumption and exports had shown relatively favorable movements.",
        "The member also expressed the view that it would be necessary to examine whether this employment sluggishness had been caused by either cyclical or structural factors, and went on to state that if employment in the construction sector remained poor and that in the manufacturing sector did not improve significantly, employment from next year onwards would also be weaker than initially forecast.",
        "The member mentioned that consumer price inflation had accelerated slightly but core inflation had remained in the lower-1% range in the second quarter, and added that future trends should be closely monitored, as consumer price inflation was now forecast to increase near its target in the fourth quarter this year and in the first half of next year, driven by factors such as international oil prices and exchange rates.",
        "Looking at the real economy, the member’s evaluation was that, although the Korean economy had recently seemed to sustain modest growth overall and a slightly positive output gap, the inflation gap was highly likely to remain negative for the time being, and therefore the current monetary easing stance should be maintained.",
        "Concerning financial stability, the member argued that attention should be paid to the recent rise in global financial market volatility, as seen especially in financial unrest in EMEs, and also to the accumulation of financial imbalances.",
        "Specifically, the member noted that it would be necessary to step up monitoring of the development and impacts of the US-China trade dispute and also to keep a close watch on the inversion of the US and Korean yield curves and trends of capital flows.",
        "The member also expressed the view that household debt growth had recently been stable but was still higher than nominal growth rate, and that in this regard it would be necessary to constantly examine and cope with growth in leasehold deposit loans, credit loans and loans to sole proprietors.",
        "And the member added that in-depth examination of how much consideration should be given to the household debt issue in monetary policy decisions would be needed.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Looking at the recent economic conditions since the May 24 Monetary Policy Board meeting, the member noted that the GDP growth forecasts for this year and next year had been revised downward by 0.1 percentage point to 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, compared to the April forecasts, and that this reflected downside risks to growth, including an escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China, continued sluggishness in employment, and a heightening of domestic and international financial market volatility.",
        "Taking into consideration, however, that the potential growth of the Korean economy was estimated at the upper-2 percent level, the member assessed actual growth to be continuing at a level consistent with its potential.",
        "With respect to consumer price inflation, the member noted that the slower uptrend in administered prices, such as costs for education and medical services, had worked as a downside risk to inflation.",
        "The member also noted that personal service price inflation, which reflects demand-side pressures relatively well, had remained in the mid-2 percent range, and supply-side inflationary pressures were growing due to the recent rises in global oil prices and the exchange rate.",
        "Against this backdrop, the member forecast consumer price inflation to be 1.6 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year.",
        "The member also expected consumer price inflation to gradually accelerate from the fourth quarter and reach its 2 percent target at the end of this year.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, in the financial markets at home and abroad, volatility in price variables had heightened due to concerns about the spread of global trade disputes.",
        "The member added that, while substantial capital outflows and rising financial unrest had been seen in EMEs, and vulnerable ones in particular, such changes in external factors would likely have limited and manageable impacts on the domestic economy and finance, given the economy’s favorable fundamentals.",
        "The member, however, noted that if the US-China trade dispute persisted or escalated to an unexpected level, and financial unrest heightened in preemptive reflection of this, it would be hard to rule out the possibility that the negative impacts could be larger than expected.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned the need for remaining on the alert and keeping an eye on household lending, since, although household lending growth had slowed thanks to government measures, it was still high compared to past years.",
        "The member then presented the view that from the perspective of financial stability, a close eye should also be kept on the higher growth in sole proprietor loans seen recently, led by real estate leasing services.",
        "With respect to the corresponding monetary policy direction, the member’s assessment was that, since GDP growth forecasts for this year and the next year were consistent with their potential growth levels, and consumer price inflation was expected to reach its target level at around the end of this year, the need had grown for paying attention to financial stability risks at home and abroad when conducting monetary policy.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that there remained a need to reduce the degree of monetary easing from the current level by raising the Base Rate in the not-distant future in order to ensure space for monetary policy in preparation for a possible change in the phase of the business cycle over a longer term horizon, and in order to preemptively alleviate potential destabilizing factors stemming from the widening of the policy rate gap between the Bank of Korea and the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent in consideration of the following factors: 1) the growth forecasts had been revised downward, albeit only slightly, in reflection of downside risks, 2) economic sentiment had weakened somewhat, due to high uncertainties about economic conditions, including the US-China trade dispute, and 3) demand-side inflationary pressures were still modest.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that, taking into overall consideration the trends in the real economy and inflation, and conditions related to financial stability, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member saw that the global economy was maintaining growth above its potential and continuing to show a modest expansionary phase.",
        "The member noted that US economic growth in the second quarter was expected to rise significantly from the previous quarter and EMEs were generally sustaining their trends of improvement, while the economies in the Euro area and Japan were showing trends of recovery.",
        "The member thus forecast that global trade would continue on a solid growth track for quite some time.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that it was necessary to closely monitor the developments and extents of any escalation of global trade disputes or heightening of financial market volatility.",
        "The member’s assessment was that, with respect to the domestic economy, although quarter-on-quarter growth was estimated to have slowed somewhat in the second quarter, this represented a technical decline since first-quarter growth had been partially attributable to one-off factors.",
        "The member noted that investment was undergoing a correction.",
        "The member, however, saw that the domestic economy was sustaining growth consistent with its potential level as exports and consumption showed favorable movements, and that the output gap remained slightly positive.",
        "Nonetheless, the member assessed uncertainties surrounding the medium to long-term growth path to remain high, due mainly to changes in policies at home and abroad.",
        "Externally, the member noted the growing concerns about the US-China trade dispute, expressing the opinion that if trade protectionism became more globally widespread, consumption and investment could be constrained greatly through strengthened risk aversion, although losses in exports stemming from already finalized trade sanctions were estimated to have been limited.",
        "Domestically, the member noted that attention should be paid to the continued sluggishness in employment.",
        "With respect to the forecasts for employment conditions in the second half against the backdrop of the government’s increase in public sector jobs and reduced impacts of the restructurings of some manufacturing industries, the member pointed out that there was a high possibility that changes in the number of persons employed would run below its forecast, given that the employment sluggishness was significantly attributable to structural factors.",
        "Meanwhile, the member added that there were positive factors surrounding the growth path in the second half, including the heightened possibility of fiscal policy being implemented in a more expansionary manner compared to that at the time of the April forecast, and the fact that the reduction in statutory working hours was being carried out more flexibly than expected.",
        "The member noted that consumer price inflation had stabilized in the mid-1 percent range of late, but there was a possibility that inflationary pressures were higher than what was suggested by headline indexes, given the price trends of items greatly affected by demand-side factors.",
        "For instance, pointing out that core inflation with administered items excluded had accelerated to the upper-1 percent level, the member expressed a need for caution with respect to determining the underlying movements of consumer prices.",
        "The member added that it should also be noted that volatilities in the exchange rate and international oil prices could be heightened for some time, due mainly to trade disputes and changes in the monetary policies of major countries.",
        "Last, in terms of financial stability, the member saw the need for constant vigilance, as household lending growth was slowing but still high.",
        "Looking at the financial markets, the member’s assessment was that sudden and large-scale capital outflows were unlikely since external soundness indicators remained strong, although price variable volatility had increased greatly due to concerns about the spread of trade disputes.",
        "The member, however, stressed the need for close monitoring of relevant risks in preparation for a possible increase in cautious sentiment with respect to the Chinese financial markets and economy stemming from the escalating trade dispute between the US and China.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, since price inflation was low and there were high uncertainties at this juncture, it would be desirable to confirm the pace of inflation growth and choose the time to raise the Base Rate accordingly, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of Looking at real economic conditions, the member evaluated that, although uncertainties surrounding the economic landscape had been mounting at home and abroad, relevant indicators pointed to solid growth.",
        "On the international front, the member noted that risks of a worsened global trade environment had mounted greatly as, in the US, the Trump administration’s protectionist stance had led to the materialization of worse-than-expected disputes with China and the EU.",
        "The member also commented that growing uncertainties related to these trade frictions had heightened anxieties in regional financial markets.",
        "The member, however, saw that the real economic indicators in the US remained more favorable than originally expected, that no indicators suggested that global trade would show slower growth, and that Korean exports also continued to show steady growth at the upper-3 percent level on a goods volume basis.",
        "On the domestic front, the member judged that there had been ongoing signs that the labor market environment was changing since the end of last year, and there were increased uncertainties as to the effects this might have on the behaviors of economic agents.",
        "The member also noted that the increase in the number of persons employed continued to show a sharp decline since the end of last year, and wages showed a significant upward trend especially led by regular wages, both of which the member attributed to a combination of factors, including growth in labor demand stemming from economic recovery, a decline in labor demand in line with the restructurings of some manufacturing industries, and a structural decline resulting from the implementation of a higher minimum wage.",
        "However, the member found it hard to assess the relative weight of each of these factors.",
        "In summary, the member determined that the evidence pointed to real economic growth at or slightly above its potential level, despite growing downside risks to the growth track caused by greatly heightened uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international economic environments.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that consumer price inflation had increased from 1.3 percent in the first quarter to 1.5 percent in the second quarter, and core inflation had recorded 1.3 percent in the second quarter as well.",
        "The member assessed that theoretically the current conditions suggested a build-up of inflationary pressures, since, on the domestic front, the positive output gap had persisted and, on the international front, the shock from the decline in the real neutral rate had diminished due to the steady recovery of global trade.",
        "The member commented that the price inflation of items sensitive to economic conditions had been accelerating since the third quarter of last year, and administered prices were constraining the growth of overall consumer price inflation due to the recent government policy to rein in price increases.",
        "The member expressed the view that, given these factors, actual consumer price inflationary pressures should be seen to be somewhat higher than the level figures showed.",
        "The member noted that the engine driving the buildup of underlying inflationary pressures was not large due to the modest growth of domestic demand, and that there was a possibility that inflation expectations themselves had become somewhat low, as price inflation had remained low since 2012, for a considerable length of time.",
        "The member saw that these factors had caused only moderate acceleration in price inflation in the second quarter and could constrain the pace of increase in inflation in the future.",
        "The member, however, added that it was difficult to predict the pace of price inflation growth in the second half due to additional factors causing price rises, including a recent substantial increase in regular wage growth and a rise in oil prices.",
        "Concerning household debt, the member's assessment was that it was high, but emergency liquidity management was not needed from a financial stability perspective.",
        "The member thus presented the opinion that, when managing interest rates, it would be necessary to check whether price inflation converges on its target, as this would result in a better management of inflation expectations, which is the objective of an inflation targeting monetary policy.",
        "One other member expressed the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level to support the continuation of recent growth, while keeping a close watch on how recently expanding risk factors would be reflected in the overall macroeconomy in the future.",
        "With regard to the domestic economy, the member’s assessment was that it had been sustaining growth at around its potential rate and had not deviated far from its expected path, boosted by the booming world economy.",
        "The member stated that exports had been showing growth in line with expectations, thanks to the strength of semiconductors and petrochemical products despite the sluggishness seen in ships and automobiles.",
        "The member added that, in terms of domestic demand moderate growth in private consumption had been continuing and government spending had been expanding rapidly, although construction investment had remained in a downturn and facilities investment had been falling due to the completion of facilities expansion in the semiconductor industry and to delayed investment in the display sector.",
        "However, the member evaluated that downside risks were predominating over upside risks with respect to the macroeconomy since the second half of this year.",
        "The member first pointed out that there were growing uncertainties as to whether the trend of rapid growth in the world economy would continue in the future as well.",
        "The member expected the boom in the US economy to continue for some time, but added that the rapid growth seen in Europe was easing somewhat.",
        "The member also pointed out the need to be mindful of the possibility that trade disputes between the US and other major countries could negatively affect the world economy.",
        "The member emphasized that, given the current escalation in trade disputes as China implemented its restructuring and deleveraging policies, a close eye should be kept on the possibility of negative spillover effects on the Korean economy expanding, as Korea’s trade is heavily dependent upon China.",
        "The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that attention should be paid to the pattern of deteriorating terms of trade in Korean economy as the surge in semiconductor prices subsides and international oil prices continue to grow.",
        "The member noted that the deterioration in the terms of trade implied that the GDP deflator was not rising as quickly as consumer prices, and pointed out that this was likely to reduce the nominal growth rate.",
        "Accordingly, the member commented that, given recent export and import price trends, the nominal growth rate could remain in the 3 percent range, lower than 5 percent range seen for the past three years.",
        "The member's assessment was that this would probably work to contract domestic demand through a decline in real purchasing power by slowing growth in overall nominal variables such as corporate sales, the current account balance and government tax revenue.",
        "The member also noted that labor market-related policy measures were understood as a factor causing price rises and slower growth through aggregate supply-side exogenous upward cost shocks.",
        "The member, however, presented the view that the recent situation, with no visible change in prices and a large slowdown in employment growth, implied that aggregate demand was not expanding.",
        "The member thus evaluated that labor market-related policy measures could weigh on growth rather than on prices.",
        "The member saw that consumer price inflation actually remained in the mid-1 percent range, despite a rise in international oil prices.",
        "The member noted that the aforementioned factors meant that there were growing downside risks to the outlook that expanded aggregate demand would help price inflation gradually accelerate to its 2 percent target level from the second half of this year.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point raise.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its robust growth.",
        "The volatility in the global financial markets has expanded, as a result mainly of concerns about the trade disputes in the world and of the strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.",
        "- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted.",
        "Employment conditions are still sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having remained at a low level.",
        "Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be slightly below the path projected in April, but to sustain a rate at its potential level.",
        "It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy.",
        "- Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-1% level, due mainly to the slowing pace of increase in agricultural and livestock product prices and despite the prices of petroleum products having risen greatly.",
        "Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen into the low-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level.",
        "Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level.",
        "Core inflation will also gradually rise.",
        "- The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has expanded, in reflection of global financial market movements.",
        "The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, in line with the global strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "Stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen to considerable extents, under the influence of heightened external uncertainties related chiefly to the US-China trade dispute.",
        "Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat.",
        "Housing sales prices have remained steady.",
        "- Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.",
        "It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."

    "2011": [
        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Many members assessed that the global economy remained on an overall upward path, with emerging market economies sustaining strong growth and the major advanced economies keeping up their paces of recovery.",
        "Some members, however, pointed out that downside risks had increased somewhat compared to the previous month, including the increased volatility of international commodity prices, the spread of global inflation and consequent possibility of economic slowdown, and China's strengthened drive for price stability.",
        "Most members evaluated the domestic economy as sustaining its solid upward trend, boosted by strong export growth and the steady increase in domestic demand.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, a majority of members anticipated that the domestic economy would show growth slightly above its long-term path, unless domestic and external conditions changed considerably from their current pattern.",
        "However, some of the members noted that if the political unrest in the MENA region worsened, the run-up in oil prices might accelerate even further and the pace of recovery might accordingly slow down somewhat.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the view that the future outlook had deteriorated, pointing to the declines in the composite consumer sentiment index and the business survey index.",
        "Members appraised the domestic financial markets as having remained stable overall, despite some unfavorable conditions including the mounting geopolitical risks in the MENA region and the suspensions of business at some savings banks.",
        "They commented that long-term market interest rates had risen in response chiefly to the acceleration of price increases, that short-term market interest rates had also continued to rise reflecting expectations of a Base Rate hike, and that stock prices had rebounded once again since the first week of March boosted by improved domestic business indicators, etc.",
        "One member pointed out that foreign currency conditions were generally favorable thanks mostly to the current account surplus and increased overseas borrowings by financial institutions, but that the share of short-term capital in foreign currency borrowings was gradually rising.",
        "Members pointed out that the growth rate of consumer price index had accelerated rapidly to reach 4.1% year-on-year in January and 4.5% in February, as the rates of increase in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products rose, and personal service fees steeply increased.",
        "Most members anticipated that international oil prices and other commodity prices would remain high, caused by the combination of such factors as increased demand from emerging market countries, ample global liquidity and the political unrest in the MENA region, and that inflation expectations were very likely to rise further.",
        "As to the real estate market, many members noted that leasehold deposits remained on the rise despite the government's stabilization efforts, and that housing prices were also picking up further in both the Seoul metropolitan area and the rest of the country, owing mostly to the decreased stock of new homes for occupancy and to a shift in housing demand away from leasehold tenancies toward housing purchases.",
        "Prior to the members' discussions regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, who explained the current economic situation and price trends, and then left the meeting.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister commented that the domestic economy was likely to maintain its robust movements for the time being, against a background of sustained buoyancy of domestic demand and exports and increased private sector employment.",
        "He added that there had been a shift to month-on-month increases in the coincident composite index and the leading composite index, both of which had until then shown somewhat lackluster movements.",
        "With regard to prices, meanwhile, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned that best efforts would be made to consolidate the basis for price stability, since difficulties were likely to persist for a time due to such factors as the risks in the MENA region and the possibility of unstable supply and demand conditions of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members agreed that, unless the recent spread of inflation expectations among the general public was curtailed in an appropriate manner, the second-round effects of supply shocks would emerge on a large scale, giving rise to concerns over the possibility of inflation much higher than anticipated, and shared the view that the degree of financial easing consequently needed to be reduced.",
        "A few of them expressed the view that a hike in the Base Rate under the current environment where inflation was accelerating would represent not a shift to a tightened monetary policy stance, but a normalization of the Base Rate level through fine-tuning of the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member was of the opinion that normalization of the Base Rate level should not be put off any longer on the grounds that if there were a change in direction of business activity, while the level of interest rates remained accommodative as it was now, a monetary policy response through interest rate adjustments would become difficult, and monetary policy effectiveness could decline as a result.",
        "Meanwhile, one member took the position that, considering that the rise in consumer prices was driven mainly by supply-side factors, in circumstances where uncertainties in domestic and external conditions had further mounted, it was desirable to maintain the current policy stance for the time being while closely monitoring changes in economic conditions.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, members decided by a majority decision to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",
        "decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be kept at its current level.)",
        "< Ref > Monetary Policy Decision today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.00%.",
        "emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept up their paces of recovery.",
        "Going forward, the Committee recognizes the existence of downside risk factors, including political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, rising oil and other international commodity prices, and sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries; nevertheless, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery.",
        "maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports have continued on their strong growth track and that domestic demand has steadily increased.",
        "Labor market conditions have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector.",
        "Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks.",
        "mostly to the rises in prices of petroleum products, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and personal services.",
        "In the coming months, this high rising price trend may persist, driven largely by increased demand pressures from the economic upswing, by instability of international commodity prices, and by elevated inflation expectations.",
        "As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have continued and the upward trend in the rest of the country has accelerated, while leasehold deposits have continued to rise.",
        "long-term market interest rates have increased, in response chiefly to external risk factors and to the steep uptrend in prices.",
        "The pace of growth in mortgage lending has accelerated somewhat compared to last month.",
        "financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with an emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Regarding the global economy, most members assessed that the paces of recovery in the U.S. and other advanced economies had exhibited signs of weakening, while emerging market economies were showing favorable performances.",
        "Many members shared the opinion that there was concern that factors such as the economic slowdown in major advanced countries, the spread of sovereign debt problems in some European countries and the international financial market unrest could limit the recovery of the global economy.",
        "One member, notably, expressed the view that the economic situation of major advanced countries was unlikely to take a turn for the better within a short space of time, since some structural factors such as the U.S. status as a reserve currency country and the euro zone situation of being a single currency bloc were making exchange rate adjustments difficult for both.",
        "Meanwhile, another member evaluated the possibility of a recurrence of a crisis similar to that in 2008 as low, given that central banks in advanced countries were expected to implement additional monetary easing, that the recent crisis was not one of systemic risks caused by a chain of large financial institutions going bankrupt as in the past, and that the strong economic growth in emerging market countries was acting as the engine of world economic recovery.",
        "Most members evaluated the domestic economy to be sustaining its upward trend, with exports showing solid growth and domestic demand English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "also maintaining a mild expansion.",
        "One of them pointed out that exports had reached an all-time high and that employment was also improving steadily.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, the judgement of a number of members was that, although the growth of the domestic economy would be sustained, the uncertainties as to its future path seemed to have deepened further, due mostly to the possibility of external destabilizing factors persisting for a long time and to the resulting increase in financial market volatility.",
        "Most members mentioned that the domestic financial markets had displayed unstable movements, as exemplified by the sharp falls in share prices and steep rise in the Korean won/US dollar exchange rate amid large scale net sales of Korean stocks by foreign investors.",
        "One of them forecasted that price variables would show high volatility for a considerable length of time, since it would be difficult to address the structural fragilities of the European and U.S. economies that were generating the international financial market unrest.",
        "Another member assessed the financial and foreign exchange sectors to be very sound, with the external debt profile and the foreign currency situation greatly improved compared to past financial crises, and the capacity to withstand rapid capital outflows thus heightened.",
        "As to consumer prices, most members noted that consumer price inflation had registered 4.7% in July, higher than in the previous month, influenced by a sharp run-up in agricultural product prices.",
        "Many members anticipated that prices would remain at a high level due not only to the destabilizing factor remaining on the supply side, which is generated mostly by the torrential rainfall, but also to other factors such as the hikes in public utility charges and mounting inflationary expectations.",
        "Some members assessed that housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas had weakened, while those in the rest of the country had posted rates of increase similar to those of the previous month, and that the rate of leasehold deposit increase had been higher than that in the preceding month.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, although the economy was exhibiting upward movements at the trend level with the manufacturing and services production showing continued growth, volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets was mounting considerably since the U.S. credit rating downgrade, and therefore a close watch needed to be kept on developments in the real economy.",
        "As to the recent instability in the global financial market, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that, although this instability was expected to have only a limited effect on the Korean economy at this stage, market stabilization measures were being actively undertaken in order to ease uncertainty and forestall market disturbance.",
        "Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, although prices were forecasted to show a slowing rate of increase from September in terms of their headline figures, there remained, as before, uncertainties as to weather conditions.",
        "He also explained that the government was strengthening its efforts to look into the factors behind the price instability and respond to them through its weekly meetings held to discuss price stabilization measures.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members shared the opinion that, although concerns about the possibility of inflationary pressures becoming entrenched for some length of time could not be ruled out, with the increased possibility of the annual rate of increase in consumer prices exceeding the original forecast, it would be better to maintain the Base Rate at its current level this month, in view of the heightened anxieties among economic agents with the recent spread of global financial instability.",
        "One member noted that a policy rate hike might amplify and transmit the uncertainty in the global financial markets to the domestic markets, and that this risk could be greater than that triggered by putting off tightening a little longer.",
        "One other member took the view that, the timing of policy implementation should be kept flexible in line with the economic situation at home and abroad, thought it was necessary to maintain the current policy stance of Base Rate normalization, with monetary policy being basically directed toward defusing the upward inflation pressures and inflation expectations.",
        "Another member voiced the opinion that efforts to normalize Base Rate must be driven forward persistently, since the opportunity to curb price rises with monetary policy was receding and the negative effects including household debt expansion and delays in corporate restructuring were gradually increasing with the pause in rate normalization.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, members decided unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "< Ref > Monetary Policy Decision to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including the US have exhibited signs of weakening.",
        "Going forward, the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the potential for continuing economic slowdown in major countries, the spread of sovereign debt problems in Europe, and international financial market unrest posing downside risks to the global economy.",
        "underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show robust growth and that domestic demand is increasing modestly.",
        "Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector.",
        "The Committee judges that the domestic economy will keep up this underlying trend going forward, but that uncertainty as to the growth path has intensified due to the impact of external risk factors.",
        "to sharp rises in the prices of agricultural products including vegetables.",
        "The Committee expects the high level of inflation to continue in the coming months, driven largely by demand-side pressures resulting from the underlying uptrend in economic activity and by inflation expectations.",
        "Core inflation meanwhile increased to the 3.8% level, and this uptrend is seen persisting for the time being.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas weakened, while prices in the rest of the country posted rates of increase similar to those for June.",
        "The rate of leasehold deposit increase rose in July compared to the previous month, with transactions becoming more active.",
        "rates have fallen sharply and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar since the start of August, due mainly to heightened external risk and international financial market instability.",
        "Mortgage lending posted a steady rise in July, as in the previous month.",
        "economic conditions both at home and abroad, including factors potentially disruptive to the financial markets, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth.",
        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Most members assessed that the global economy was sustaining its recovery overall, but that uncertainties were deepening further due to latent risk factors.",
        "Many members noted that the U.S. economic recovery had slowed owing to the sluggish housing market and the delay in the labor market improvement, that in Europe the mood was one fraught with anxiety as to the possibility of the spread of the sovereign debt problems to neighboring countries, and that potential risk factors sat latent including an overheating economy and surging consumer and asset prices in the emerging market economies.",
        "The domestic economy was, most members appraised, maintaining its upward trend boosted by strong exports and the recovery of domestic demand.",
        "One member pointed out that manufacturing and services production was growing with the current account having remained in surplus for 15 straight months, and that the employment situation was improving.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, most members anticipated that the domestic economy would sustain its long-term trend level of growth, even though July’s revised growth forecast was somewhat lower than previously predicted.",
        "However, members cautioned that the downside risks to growth had slightly increased due to mounting uncertainty surrounding the external economic environment.",
        "As to domestic financial markets, many members attributed the large fluctuation in price variables, including interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, to external factors such as the possibility of an escalation of the sovereign debt problems in Europe and a slowdown in U.S. economic recovery.",
        "However, one member commented that foreign funding conditions were favorable by and large due mostly to inflows of foreign portfolio funds and the current account surplus.",
        "Members pointed out that consumer prices were exhibiting a rapid pace of increase in excess of 4% for six straight months, owing to the rapid path-through to general prices of the supply shocks generated by higher agricultural product and global oil prices, and to the steady build-up of inflation expectations.",
        "They also noted that core inflation, too, had accelerated to 3.7% in June, after having registered 3.2% in April and consumer prices would persist for some considerable time, owing primarily to the demand-pull pressures arising from sustained growth and inflation expectations, and that core inflation would rise at a faster pace than headline inflation.",
        "As to the real estate market, some members evaluated housing sales prices as being weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas with the dampening of buying sentiment, while exhibiting slower growth in the rest of the country.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, although the economy was regaining momentum for a stable recovery with the number of persons employed continuing to grow and the employment-to-population ratio improving, uncertainties still remained high as external conditions were highly volatile and real purchasing power declined.",
        "As to the government’s economic policy directions for the second half of 2011 announced on June 30, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that the growth forecast had been revised downward from the initial 5.0% to the 4.5% level and the inflation projection had been adjusted upward from around 3.0% to 4.0%, in reflection of the many changes in conditions at home and abroad since the end of last year, such as the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, the run-up in oil prices and the Great East Japan Earthquake.",
        "He then noted that the government’s policy focus would be placed on such areas as price stability, boosting domestic demand and expanding the social safety net.",
        "Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned that the government anticipated inflationary pressures would persist for the time being, owing to the recent rises in prices of agricultural and livestock products following the recent unusually severe rain, and to the increase in personal service charges including those for eating-out, and that it was considering steps for price stability such as a sliding tariff on pork and rice, release of government oil reserves, and incentives to hold eating-out prices steady.",
        "Meanwhile, concerning the Comprehensive Measures on Household Debt which the government unveiled on June 29, the 1st Vice Minister noted that, in order to manage household debt and enhance the soundness of financial institutions, the government would pursue measures to accommodate household debt increase at an appropriate level, to encourage fixed-rate, non-deferrable, amortizing mortgages not vulnerable to economic fluctuations, and to strengthen protection for consumers taking out household loans.",
        "The main contents of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follow: Members agreed that, it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month since it was necessary to maintain stability in the financial markets following the recent deepening of economic uncertainties surrounding foreign economies, although it was desirable to gradually normalize the Base Rate ╶ considering the possibility of chronic inflation becoming entrenched, with inflation forecasts flirting with the upper bound of the inflation target and expected inflation remaining high, at a time when the economy continued on a long-term trend level of growth.",
        "One member voiced the opinion that policy adjustments should be made at a consistent pace since a back-to-back Base Rate adjustment following the one in June might have to face a heavier-than-necessary burden on economic agents, with the risk of market participants perceiving that the Bank of Korea’s stance of steady baby step increase in the Base Rate maintained for some time had been changed.",
        "Meanwhile, some members took the view that it was necessary to signal appropriately to the markets once again the present policy stance of consistently moving forward with Base Rate normalization since putting off a hike in the policy rate might cause inflation expectations to rise, particularly in the current circumstances where a high rising trend of prices was seen to persist for some time.",
        "In addition, one member made the point that rate normalization must be carried forward persistently so as to allow real interest rates to move out of negative territory, in that, should a low interest rate stance prevail for a long time, there was concern that economic imbalances could deepen largely owing to an expansion of household debt and delay in corporate restructuring and that the high level of macro leverage could pose a potential risk for the Korean economy.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, members decided unanimously to keep the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "< Ref > Monetary Policy Decision to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period.",

        "to sharp rises in the prices of some agricultural and livestock products.",
        "The Committee expects the high level of inflation to continue in the coming months, driven largely by demand-side pressures resulting from the underlying uptrend in economic activity and by inflation expectations.",
        "Core inflation meanwhile increased to the 3.7% level, as the prices of processed food products and personal services continued to rise; this uptrend in core inflation is seen persisting for the time being.",
        "As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas have weakened, while their pace of increase in the rest of the country has slowed.",
        "The rate of increase in leasehold deposits fell in June compared to the previous month, affected mostly by seasonal factors.",
        "such as interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates have widened, due mainly to the effects of external risk factors including the sovereign debt problems in Europe.",
        "Mortgage lending has posted a steady rise.",
        "financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth.",
        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussed as follows: Many members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its pace of recovery, despite destabilizing factors such as the Great East Japan Earthquake, the run-up in international oil prices, etc.",
        "A few members, however, pointed out that uncertainty over the future path of growth had increased slightly compared to that forecast in December of last year, due mostly to the political unrest in the MENA region, the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries and the possibility of a protracted fallout from the Great East Japan Earthquake.",
        "Most members evaluated the domestic economy as sustaining its upward trend, boosted by exports, which had reached an all-time monthly high.",
        "A few members noted, however, that some indicators related to domestic demand such as consumption and investment had temporarily shown signs of faltering, affected by the Lunar New Year holidays, outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, etc.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that Korea would see economic growth at around the mid-4% level this year, led by the strength in exports coupled with the expansion in global trade volume.",
        "Many members appraised the domestic financial markets as having regained stability overall from the end of March onwards, despite the increased volatility arising from greater risks in the overseas sector.",

        "Most members pointed out that the consumer price index growth rate had accelerated to as high as 4.7% year-on-year in March, due to demand-side pressures from the economic upturn, accompanied by the run-ups in international commodity prices and spread of foot-and-mouth disease, and noted that core inflation had also risen to around the mid-3% level.",
        "Concerning the price outlook as well, members anticipated that, although the CPI growth rate might slow somewhat on the back of government's micro-level efforts, upward pressures would remain high due mainly to increased inflation expectations.",

        "As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister pointed out that price conditions at home and abroad remained uncertain, and added that the government would therefore implement policy measures with priority placed upon achieving price stability.",
        "Regarding the real estate market, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned that the government would strive to implement as scheduled its measures for boosting housing transactions and stabilizing leasehold deposits and monthly rental fees.",
        "These measures are expected to help the housing market return to normalcy and relieve the burdens on the ordinary people.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members agreed that, although it would be desirable to further reduce the degree of monetary policy easing given that the economy would remain on an upward track and high level of prices would persist, it would be better to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month, considering such factors as the recent rapid pace of the won's appreciation against the US dollar and heightened uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "Many members expressed the view, however, that while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, the committee should clearly signal to the market that it would persistently proceed with the normalization of the Base Rate so as to reduce the possibility of inflation expectations spreading among the general public.",
        "Meanwhile, one member showed the concern that, if real interest rates remained negative for a long time, the ample liquidity might create bubbles in the prices of assets, such as stocks and real estate, and financial institutions might then ease their lending attitudes, leading to a consequent further rise in household debt and worsening the macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "The member then maintained that, in the event of a business cycle transition amid heightened economic uncertainties, an awkward situation might come where the rate hike stance would have to be dropped without having quite tamed inflation.",
        "To prevent this situation, he added, the central bank needed to raise the Base Rate preemptively while there was still time.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that rates needed to be normalized as soon as possible, since problems such as rising household debt, declining personal savings rates, soaring housing leasehold deposits as well as monthly rental fees and a large increase in real estate project financing loans were all related in considerable part to low interest rates.",

        "Another member pointed out that the government's micro-level inflation policy was analyzed as likely to have only a limited impact in the long-term, although it might prove effective in the short-term, and added that it was necessary to normalize the Base Rate in order to improve the weak financial structure of households and to raise the household savings rate.",
        "Some members, meanwhile, took the position that, considering that the rise in consumer prices was driven mainly by supply-side factors, in conditions of high domestic and international uncertainty, it was desirable to maintain the current policy stance and to closely monitor changes in economic conditions in the months ahead.",

        "Meanwhile, one member pointed out that the gradual Base Rate hikes thus far had been insufficient to calm inflation expectations and upward price pressures; he added that the feared side effects of the Base Rate hikes had not occurred, but that instead problems arising from the low interest rates, such as increasing household debt and a disincentive to save, were becoming more pronounced in several sectors.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, since expected inflation was at the moment very high, and the economic imbalances caused by low interest rates including increased preference for risky assets and rising household debt could intensify, interest rates must in this situation be normalized as soon as possible, so that real interest rates could move out of negative territory before signs of economic activity weakened due to heightened uncertainties surrounding the global economy.",

        "Regarding consumer prices, most members anticipated that, although headline consumer price inflation had come in at 3.9% in October, down from 4.3% the previous month due largely to the stability of agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices and the base effect from the previous year, it would fluctuate at a high level for the time being—owing chiefly to public utility charge hikes, to higher import prices, and to mounting pressures stemming from expected inflation.",

        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister assessed that, although the economy was maintaining its trend of recovery, as exemplified by increased production in the mining and manufacturing sector in September and improved employment conditions, there was mounting uncertainty about domestic economic developments as some real economic indicators including service sector production, retail sales and facilities investment were showing movements suggestive of a slight slowdown.",
        "Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister noted that consumer price inflation had dropped in October compared to the preceding month, but predicted that it would be somewhat higher in November due mostly to a base effect and to increases in import prices.",
        "He disclosed that the government would therefore push ahead with both short and long-term countermeasures for price stability going forward, as planned.",
        "As to export and import trends, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that exports had shown slower growth in October, due chiefly to the base effect and to decreased exports to the US and the EU in line with the global fiscal crisis, while imports had fallen from the preceding month owing largely to the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar and the decline in international commodity prices.",
        "He revealed that the October current account surplus was as a result estimated to be slightly wider than that in September.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister also assessed the employment situation as sustaining its overall buoyancy, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding external conditions.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, although it was necessary to press ahead with normalization of the Base Rate in order to curb inflation expectations and firmly anchor the basis for price stability, it would be better to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period in view of the increasing downside risks to the domestic economy and the ongoing global financial market unrest.",
        "One member opined that attention should be paid to the fact that adverse effects from the persistence of low interest rates for an extended period were already appearing, in the form of a deepening of economic imbalances—with real interest rates currently remaining negative and household and corporate lending growth accelerating—and that the Base Rate hikes should consequently be resumed, once the global financial market unrest had eased to some extent and positive signs of changes in economic activity had reemerged.",
        "Another member expressed the view that, in circumstances like at present—where external destabilizing factors remained and economic conditions in the coming months were unclear—any sudden shift in the monetary policy stance might induce anxiety among economic agents and cause expectations for interest rate policy to be skewed, and that monetary policy effectiveness could thus be best secured by managing and guiding the formation of market expectations through announcement effects related to the direction of interest rate policy.",

        "After hearing staff briefings on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, many members assessed emerging market economies to be sustaining strong growth, and major advanced economies including the U.S. to be showing economic recoveries stronger than those expected at the end of last year.",
        "A few members, however, noted that risk factors remained, including the heightened volatility of international commodity prices, further tightening by China, and the sovereign debt problems in some European countries.",
        "One member meanwhile pointed out that, in the global financial markets, there were signs of investment funds moving from the bond markets into the stock markets, and from emerging market countries into advanced countries, as the tendency toward high-risk, high-yield investment has intensified.",
        "Most members evaluated the recent domestic economy as sustaining its solid upward path, led by strong export growth and the steady increase in domestic demand.",
        "They commented that exports showed strong growth, having hit an all-time monthly high in January, that facilities and construction investment was seen to be on the rise, and that production in both the manufacturing and services sectors was steadily growing.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, members anticipated that the domestic economy would remain on a solid upward track.",
        "Many members' evaluation was that export conditions were likely to remain favorable, on the back of high growth in emerging market economies and strengthened momentum of recovery in the advanced economies, and that domestic demand was expected to rise steadily, bolstered by increased household purchasing power and strong corporate investment sentiment.",
        "One member, however, pointed out the necessity of paying attention to the economic situation in the coming months, in view of the declines in both the consumer survey index and the business survey index.",
        "Members appraised the domestic financial markets as having remained stable overall, despite the mounting geopolitical risks in the MENA region.",
        "They noted that long-term market rates had risen greatly, affected by the Base Rate hike, the expectations of rising prices, and an increase in Treasury bond issuance volume, and added that stock prices had recorded a historic high and had fallen slightly afterwards, while the Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Members pointed to the fast acceleration of the consumer price index from December last year to reach 4.1% year-on-year in January, centering around petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.",
        "Most members anticipated that the CPI would rise above the upper bound of the inflation target for the time being, owing to heightened inflation pressures from both the demand and supply sides.",
        "They appraised the perception of inflation instability by the general public as being very high, since inflation expectations had risen sharply.",
        "As to the real estate market, members noted that housing leasehold deposits had continued to rise, and that housing sales prices showed upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas while maintaining their upward trend in the rest of the country.",

        "Prior to the members' discussions regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, who explained the current economic situation and price trends, and the directions of policies in response to these trends, and then left the meeting.",
        "The 1st Vice Minister commented that the domestic economy had recently remained on an overall course of recovery, boosted by the continued improvement of the employment market, particularly in the private sector, amid sustained strengths of exports and of production in the manufacturing and services sectors.",
        "With regard to prices, meanwhile, the 1st Vice Minister mentioned that the situation remained difficult owing to supply-side shocks including the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, the severe cold weather and the run-up in global commodity prices, and added that external uncertainties appeared to be increasing somewhat due to the political unrest in the Middle East and widespread global inflation.",
        "Consequently, the 1st Vice Minister noted that, the focus of government policy would be placed on actively containing inflation expectations.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members agreed that, although the degree of financial easing needed to be gradually reduced, as concerns about rising prices were mounting with the CPI and expected inflation having increased substantially of late, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level this month, because a consecutive Base Rate hike might undermine the stability of price variables in the financial markets, and because the effects of government measures needed to be monitored.",
        "One of them voiced the opinion that a hike in the Base Rate in response to price rises of this type might have more disadvantages than advantages, since recent price rises were attributable mainly to supply-side factors.",

        "Meanwhile, some other members commented that as the expected inflation in the private sector had risen sharply, and there was also a strong possibility of the run-up in global commodity prices leading to rises in wage and overall price, thus the stance of financial easing needed to be adjusted preemptively to soothe inflation expectations and demand-side pressures.",

        "After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Most members assessed the global economy to be sustaining its modest recovery as emerging market economies continued to show favorable performances, although the paces of recovery in advanced economies had exhibited signs of faltering unlike in the previous month.",
        "A few members noted that external uncertainties remained, including the possibility of slowdowns in major advanced economies, the resurgence of sovereign debt problems in the euro area triggered by concerns over the Greek debt restructuring, and the persistent aftereffects of the Great East Japan Earthquake.",
        "Most members appraised the domestic economy as maintaining its underlying uptrend boosted by the sustained high growth of exports, despite the temporary sluggishness of domestic demand.",
        "One member pointed out that exports had hit a record high in May, as in the previous month, with the current account having registered 14 consecutive months of surplus through April.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic economy would remain on an upward track on the back of export buoyancy, notwithstanding latent external risk factors.",
        "As to the domestic financial markets, members judged foreign funding conditions to be favorable owing to foreigners’ increased investment in domestic bonds, although price variable volatility had risen as exemplified by falling stock prices and long-term interest rates and depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar, due mostly to mounting uncertainties in the global economy.",
        "One member pointed out that mortgage lending had been rising steadily, bolstered mainly by banks' efforts to expand their loan books and by low lending rates.",
        "Most members noted that, despite declines in price of petroleum and agricultural products, consumer price inflation had remained high at 4.1% in May, similar to the previous month’s 4.2%, and that core inflation had also accelerated to 3.5% from 3.2% the month before.",
        "Many members mentioned that core inflation was expected to exceed headline inflation in the fourth quarter, as strong inflationary pressures persisted in the coming months, fueled mainly by further hikes in public utility charges, by the second-round effects of supply-side shocks and by increased demand from the economic upswing.",
        "As for the real estate market, most members observed that, with housing leasehold deposits having sustained their rise, apartment sales prices were showing a slight downward tendency in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while their high rising trend in the rest of the country continued.",
        "Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.",
        "With regard to the current economic situation, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, despite undergoing some adjustments affected mostly by the run-up in oil prices and the fallout from the Great East Japan Earthquake, the economy as a whole was expected to remain on course for recovery.",
        "As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that they had risen at a somewhat slower pace in May, due chiefly to the fall in prices of agricultural products and the stabilization of petroleum prices, but that demand-pull inflationary pressures were judged to be gradually building.",
        "He added that the government thus strengthened its responses at the micro level with a focus on items exhibiting price instability, and planned to draw up measures to stabilize public utility fees in the second half.",
        "Meanwhile, the 1st Vice Minister commented that, efforts were being made to lower the ceiling on foreign exchange forward positions and to curb domestic issuance of foreign currency-denominated bonds (aka from early this year, owing to increased sales of offshore non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) by foreigners and to a sharp expansion in kimchi bond issuance.",
        "In addition, concerning the household debt problem, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that engineering a soft landing type of resolution ― where household debt is consistently kept at an appropriate level so as not to exceed the extent by which the real economy expands ― was very important from a medium- to long-term perspective, and that the government was therefore reviewing relevant policies to this end.",
        "The main contents of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follow: Members agreed that, given that the domestic economy was showing an upward trend despite the external uncertainties, and that going forward it was also forecasted to maintain growth at its long-term trend level for a considerable period of time, it was necessary to further lessen the degree of monetary easing to defuse inflationary pressures and check the spread of inflation expectations.",
        "Many members anticipated that, with the CPI growth rate exceeding the upper bound of the inflation target range, consumer prices would remain on a high rising trend for the time being, affected mostly by the hikes in public utility charges, the second-round effects of supply shocks on prices, and increased demand-pull pressures triggered by the economic recovery.",
        "They also voiced concerns that the possibility of chronic high inflation becoming entrenched could not be ruled out.",
        "One member assessed the domestic economy as highly vulnerable to internal and external shocks, due chiefly to credit expansion in line with the continuation of negative real interest rates, to economic agents’ relaxation of attitudes toward risk, and to the rises in asset prices.",
        "He insisted that a rate hike aimed at strengthening the economic fabric was thus necessary so that the latent risk factors would not materialize.",
        "Another member voiced the view that, to resolve the household debt problem, one of the most difficult challenges facing the economy, the central bank could not but choose measures that curb new borrowings and encourage voluntary deleveraging even though households’ interest burdens might increase.",
        "He added that if an active monetary policy were not implemented on account of households’ interest burdens, then such a policy could never be applied unless aggregate household debt were to contract, resulting in the household debt problem working as a factor restricting the Bank of Korea’s interest rate policy.",
        "He opined as well that, since household debt and savings were two sides of the same coin, it was necessary to adopt a balanced stance on interest rate policy, taking both financial debt and savings into consideration.",
        "Another member argued that, given the gradually increasing possibility of future economic slowdown stemming from changes in the domestic and external environment, there was a growing need to secure room for future policy maneuvering in advance.",
        "After the discussions detailed above, members resolved unanimously to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points.",

        "The Committee expects inflationary pressures to continue in the coming months, driven largely by increased demand from the economic upswing and by inflation expectations.",
        "Core inflation has risen to the mid-3% range, as the effects of the recent rises in price of oil and farm products are being passed through to the prices of such items as processed food products and personal service fees; there is also a possibility of this uptrend in core inflation persisting in the future.",
        "As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have come to a halt, while the steep upward trend in the rest of the country has continued.",

        "One member, however, expected the global economy to keep up its moderate and slow recovery as originally projected, despite a slight increase in downside risks to growth.",
        "A number of members evaluated the domestic economy as maintaining an underlying trend of growth above its long-term trajectory, buoyed by solid exports, although the economy had shown signs of faltering somewhat with manufacturing production having decreased in July.",
        "Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic economy would achieve growth at around the level of its potential growth rate, on the back of favorable exports, although the rate of growth might decline slightly due to the economic slowdowns in major advanced countries.",
        "One member pointed out that, if the growth momentum in major advanced economies weakened, a very critical touchstone in determining future economic trend would be whether the emerging market countries could successfully lead the global economy instead.",
        "Some members’ assessment of the domestic financial markets was that the volatility of price variables appeared to have decreased somewhat from September, but that they were still responding sensitively to changes English on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "in external conditions, as seen especially in the stock market.",
        "One other member, however, mentioned that the negative effects had not yet appeared large, given the continued inflows of foreign bond investment funds, with the domestic economic fundamentals still remaining favorable despite the global financial market instability.",
        "As to consumer prices, most members noted that consumer price inflation had accelerated significantly, from 4.7% in July to 5.3% in August, due mainly to a rise in agricultural product prices, and that core and expected inflation had also posted high rates of 4.0% and 4.2%, respectively.",
        "Many members reasoned that, although the stabilization of agricultural product prices and base-period effects would serve as factors in blunting consumer price inflation, the upside risks could be viewed as still large due to factors like high expected inflation, public utility charge increases, the continued uptrends in leasehold deposits and monthly rents, and growing demand for nominal wage hikes.",
        "Therefore, they anticipated that prices would continue running at a high level for a considerable period of time.",
        "A few members observed that housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas appeared weak, while those elsewhere were sustaining their trend of sharp increase.",
        "One of the members pointed out that more carefully-crafted regionally-specific policy responses were required to prevent a new risk factor for the Korean economy emerging in the form of a real estate market showing divergent movements in different regions.",
        "The main details of the MPC members’ discussion concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members expressed the opinion that, although the rate of inflation was still at a high level, it would be better to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the ensuing month, in view of the current situation in which the risks of a global economic downturn and risk factors in the international financial markets had partially materialized.",
        "However, some other members voiced the view that, although uncertainties concerning the economic outlook had risen a bit more, the central bank’s resolve to pursue price stability should be clearly communicated to the markets, and consideration should be given to the fact that there was not much time left for interest rate normalization with business indicators weakening.",
        "One of these members noted that the annual rate of consumer price inflation was certain to exceed the original forecast and the upper bound of the inflation target.",
        "He then pointed out that, in a situation with Korea’s economic fundamentals remaining sound, unless the problem of price instability was resolved soon, it would detract from monetary policy’s capacity to deal with the real economy in the event of a further deterioration of external conditions.",

        "Some members pointed out that inflation would gradually slow in the future, should demand-side pressures ease as the economic upturn faltered, and should the base-period effect from the year before set in, but that there could be no relaxing of vigilance against the risk of the current stubbornly high level of expected inflation acting as a factor pressuring prices higher for a considerable time.",

        "Regarding prices, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that consumer price inflation had posted a 4.3% rise in September, down 1.0%p from August, and predicted that it would remain on a downward path in October as well.",
        "He added, however, that if exchange rate volatility were to increase due to such factors as the recent euro area sovereign debt crisis and the prospect of a global economic slowdown, this could act as a factor destabilizing prices.",
        "As to the employment trend, the 1st Vice Minister noted that although the number of persons employed had shown a slower pace of increase in September than in the previous month—at about 260,000 persons year-on-year—the overall labor market recovery appeared to be continuing.",

        "As to recent developments in the domestic economy, members assessed Korean economic growth to be gradually slowing.",

        "Regarding consumer prices, members noted that expected inflation continued to exceed 4%, as headline consumer price inflation had come in at 4.2% in November, up from 3.6% the month before due to the rising price trends of food grains and industrial products, and core inflation had also registered 3.5%, slightly up from the previous month.",

        "Concerning prices, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that consumer prices had risen 4.2% year-on-year in November, and predicted that they would show unstable movements in December, owing chiefly to possible adjustments of agricultural product prices and charges for services at year-end.",

        "One member noted that now was not the right time to hike the Base Rate, given the heightened possibility of a phase transition in the business cycle.",

        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, although the US economy was showing recovery from its contraction, uncertainties still existed due to unexpectedly weak employment numbers in the US, that the improvements in the euro area, although weak, had continued, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its moderate growth, boosted by the government’s aggressive policy measures.",
        "As to international financial markets, most members evaluated global stock prices as exhibiting generally stable movements, due chiefly to the run-up in international oil prices, and Treasury bond yields and exchange rates in major countries as having shown wide fluctuations, influenced for instance by changes in expectations for the Fed rate hike.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that the trend of decline in exports had continued and the trend of improvement in domestic demand had weakened, with consumption and construction investment remaining sluggish.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, some members evaluated that, with price variable volatility having increased, influenced for instance by changes in expectations related to monetary policies at home and abroad, long-term market interest rates and the won-dollar rate had significantly fallen in June after having risen, and stock prices had rebounded after having fallen.",
        "As to prices, some members noted that consumer price inflation had fallen month-on-month to 0.8 percent, owing chiefly to a slowdown in the extent of increase in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also declined slightly month-on-month to 1.6 percent.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that it would be best to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level for the intermeeting period, while closely examining the possibility of expanded risks to financial stability brought about by the rate cut.",
        "The member noted that, given the recent slow growth and low inflation and several latent downside risk factors surrounding economic conditions at home and abroad, there seemed to be a greater need for more accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member went on to comment that an accommodative monetary policy stance at this point in time can work to preemptively ease the negative impacts of the scheduled full-scale corporate restructuring, and that, if the UK decides to leave the European Union, international financial market volatility may be heightened greatly, and thus measures should be devised in advance to respond to it.",
        "Meanwhile, the member emphasized that, as a Base Rate cut could cause household debt growth, the Bank of Korea should more closely monitor the household debt trend and if necessary timely implement macroprudential policy measures in consultation with the government and the supervisory authorities.",
        "The member also stressed that, as the current slow growth and low inflation trend is greatly attributable to structural factors, it was necessary to pursue continuous structural reforms and expansionary fiscal policy, as well as accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from its current level to 1.25% for the intermeeting period to buffer against growing downside risks to the macroeconomy.",
        "Concerning recent macroeconomic conditions, the member judged that, although the declining trend in inflation was easing, consumer price inflation was still far below the inflation target of 2%.",
        "The member noted that the government’s fiscal policy space was reduced, private consumption was restrained by structural factors and thus unlikely to drive economic recovery, and there was no high possibility of exports recovering within a short space of time, as the lack of global growth momentum continued.",
        "The member pointed out that, under these circumstances, the restructuring of vulnerable industries scheduled for the second half of 2016 could put heavier downward pressures on the macroeconomy in the short term.",
        "Accordingly, the member expressed the view that it was necessary to buffer against downside risks to the macroeconomy through a preemptive Base Rate cut.",
        "The member also emphasized the need for close policy cooperation with the financial supervisory authorities to strengthen the management of the soundness of collective loans, loans from non-banking financial institutions, and the Korea Housing Finance Corporation (KHFC) to ensure that the household debt problem, regarded as the biggest negative side effect of the Base Rate cut, did not expand rapidly.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that, in overall judgment of the trend of the real economy, it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points this month.",
        "First, the member argued that, without timely policy measures, it would be difficult to be optimistic about a recovery of consumption and the economy, noting that downside risks had increased since May as consumption and construction investment had started to decrease in the second quarter while household consumption continued to mark time, due to structural factors such as the rapid progress of population ageing and the worsening of income distribution, and also to strengthening preferences for liquidity and shrinking consumer sentiment in line with growing uncertainties throughout the economy.",
        "Meanwhile, the member presented the view that consumer price inflation remained at a low level of around 1 percent year-on-year and, although economic participation and employment rates were recently rising, this was attributable to the gradual expansion in labor market capacity in line with the rising rate of employment of the over-50s offsetting the declining rate of youth employment, and this was unlikely to lead to upward pressures on inflation over a medium-term horizon.",
        "In light of this, the member took the view that additional policy measures should be made to pull up consumer price inflation to close to its target of 2 percent, and that in order to minimize potential risks from the Base Rate cut, it would be necessary to carry out corporate restructuring effectively, to manage potential risks to cope with the possibility of a spread of international financial market unrest, to monitor risks involved with household loans that were increasing centering around collective loans, to promote close cooperation for information exchanges among the related authorities and to take flexible policy measures.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environment, it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward from the current 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent this month.",
        "The member mentioned that, considering future downside risks, the growth target presented in the April forecast might not be easy to achieve and consumer prices were likely to remain short of their 2 percent target for a considerable period of time.",
        "The member went on to stress that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would be needed to prepare for the possibility of a continuation of low growth and slow price rises.",
        "The member presented the view that the growth rate should be improved by strengthening economic fundamentals, such as through industrial structural reforms and by supporting such structural reforms with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies, and the member further added that it would be necessary to respond preemptively to the possibility of corporate restructuring acting as a downside risk to investment and consumption in the second half of the year.",
        "Meanwhile, the member argued that it would be necessary to cope continuously with household debt problems with supervisory policies, so as to create conditions for the implementation of accommodative monetary policy.",
        "In addition, the member noted the analysis that, since the US Fed was highly likely to maintain its stance of gradual rate hikes, overall market instability was unlikely to occur, although capital outflows and a rise in foreign exchange rate volatility might take place in the short term.",
        "The member went on to state that now would be the right time for the Bank of Korea to reduce its Base Rate, prior to a possible US rate hike.",
        "In conclusion, the member emphasized that it is time to strengthen the monitoring of uncertain external conditions, including a possible Brexit and potential US rate hikes, and to consider above all the sluggish economic situation, in order to respond preemptively to future downside risks.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that downside risks to economic growth had grown, and as a result the targets presented in the April forecast might not be achieved easily.",
        "Looking at cyclical factors, the member mentioned that consumption had been weakening, and if corporate profitability decreased as international oil prices returned to normal, real wages and consumption could be restricted.",
        "In terms of structural factors, meanwhile, the member argued that the Korean economy was faced with fundamental problems that included a decline in the global trade volume, excess capacity in the manufacturing industry throughout the globe, and changes in the demand structure, and the member added that heightened uncertainties concerning future incomes and life extension, combined with population aging, led to more savings and thereby weakened consumption capacity more than expected.",
        "The member set out the view that restructuring at this point in time was considered highly desirable and essential to enhance the potential growth rate, but if corporate restructuring began in full scale, this could dampen consumer and investor sentiment, and the member added that macroeconomic policy measures needed to be implemented to further boost economic growth.",
        "The member went on to argue that, in overall consideration of these factors, it would be appropriate to cut the Base Rate this month by 25 basis points from the current 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent.",
        "Another member presented a number of major considerations for the appropriate operation of monetary policy.",
        "First, downside risks to the growth path had increased significantly, as fiscal expenditure capacity had been weakening and negative effects of the progress of corporate restructuring on production and employment, such as the shrinking of investor sentiment, had become apparent, while external demand had remained sluggish for a long time.",
        "Second, demand-side inflationary pressures were seen to be somewhat insufficient to pull inflation up to its target over a medium-term horizon, considering the trend of prices of items sensitive to business cycles.",
        "Third, slack in the production sector had been expanding, with the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector declining to the lowest level since the financial crisis and facilities investment demand pressures decreasing at a faster pace.",
        "Looking at the labor market, the member also noted that overall slack had not improved due to the widening unemployment rate gap, and there existed a high level of instability with corporate restructuring taking shape.",
        "Based on the examination of these considerations, the need for a Base Rate adjustment seemed to have increased month-on-month from a macroeconomic perspective, and considering that it takes some time for a policy measure to take effect, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.50 percent to entail a substantial amount of costs and risks in terms of financial stability.",
        "In this regard, in the future efforts should be made to minimize the negative side effects of policies with attention paid to changes in the credit cycle and the trend of related risks, to international financial market instability caused by the possibility of Brexit and changing expectations of the US Fed’s rate hikes, and to the spread of risks involving the real economy and financial stability in line with the implementation of corporate restructuring.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%.",
        "the US economy has appeared to be emerging from its temporary slowdown.",
        "The improvements in the euro area, although weak, have continued, and the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate growth.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including the monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries, and international oil price movements.",
        "of decline and the improvements in domestic demand activities such as consumption have weakened, while the sentiments of economic agents have also been sluggish.",
        "On the employment front, although the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowed somewhat in April, the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate maintained the same levels as in April of last year.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges that the downside risks to the growth path forecast made in April have expanded.",
        "in May, owing chiefly to a slowdown in the extent of increase in agricultural product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.8% in April.",
        "Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer price inflation will continue at a low level, under the influence of the low oil prices for example.",
        "In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase.",
        "risen after having previously fallen, in reflection mainly of global stock market movements, and long-term market interest rates have declined, influenced mostly by the sluggishness of some economic indicators.",
        "The Korean won has fluctuated to a large extent against the US dollar, affected mainly by changes in the expectations for a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The won has meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen.",
        "Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying greater attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the possibility of a British exit from the European Union, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries and capital flow movements, the progress of corporate restructuring, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy had maintained its recovery with its employment indicators improving and private consumption growing, that the improvements in the euro area, although weak, had continued and downside risks had been increasing due mainly to the possibility of the effects of Brexit spreading to the real economy, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its moderate growth, boosted for example by expectations of a delayed rate hike by the US Fed.",
        "As to international financial markets, some members mentioned that global stock prices had plunged on the Brexit decision but stabilized quickly thanks to prompt policy responses by major advanced countries, and during this process Treasury bond yields in these countries had fallen significantly.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that, although the trend of decline in exports had continued, the economy had been showing improvement centering around domestic demand, with consumption and construction investment growing month-on-month.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, some members evaluated that after the Brexit decision stock prices and the won-dollar rate had fallen suddenly but soon recovered, and long-term market interest rates had declined significantly in line with the movements of Treasury bond yields in major countries.",
        "As to prices, some members noted that consumer price inflation had remained at 0.8 percent since the previous month, with a sharp decline in agricultural product prices offsetting the continued rise in service fees, and that core inflation had risen slightly month-on-month to 1.7 percent.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that although the pace of growth was expected to slow somewhat in the second half due mainly to the slowing growth in consumption and construction investment and to a full-scale implementation of corporate restructuring amid a delay in the recovery of world trade, the underlying trend of recovery was expected to continue, albeit at a moderate pace, boosted largely by government policies.",
        "However, the member noted that constant examination is needed as to whether any changes in the growth path would occur in line with developments related to uncertainties, including those regarding Brexit.",
        "Second, the member argued that the path forecast for consumer prices had been adjusted downward slightly, but core inflation was expected to remain on the rise without any significant changes made to its path.",
        "However, the member also stated that to ensure that the inflation target is achieved over a medium-term horizon, demand-side inflation pressures needed to increase slightly from the current level.",
        "Third, the member pointed out that in line with recent growth in the volume of exports, the slack in the manufacturing sector improved slightly but substantial slack still remained, and so did the overall slack in the labor market, which was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, in the younger generation and in restructuring-related regions.",
        "Based on all of this, the member argued that the growth and price paths did not have solid footing and their uncertainties were extremely high, but considering that this had already been expected during the last month’s rate cut, it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "In addition, the member stated that while closely examining ripple effects of the Base Rate cut, details of a supplementary budget, and negative side effects of low interest rates in terms of financial stability, including changes in the behavior of economic agents and in incentives, it would be appropriate to carefully monitor the developments of factors causing uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as domestic economic conditions had not changed much from the previous month and the international financial markets had shown stability in the short term.",
        "The member also presented the view that it would be advisable to carefully examine various possible risk factors arising from the continuing trend of low interest rates.",
        "First of all, the member argued that attention needed to be paid to the growing proportions of not only household debt but also vulnerable borrowers, including marginal households.",
        "The member went on to state that without the recovery of a virtuous circle where boosted consumption leads to corporate investment, related risks would increase gradually.",
        "The member also stressed that management and supervision were required to prevent the excessive growth of risks related to yield-searching in the low growth environment.",
        "The member further stated the opinion that, given the possibility of the current structural problems of the real economy lasting for a longer period time and also considering potential risks in the financial markets, our major tasks should include creating a macroeconomic environment where economic policies can be operated in an effective manner and making full use of macroprudential policies that ensure financial stability.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, considering the preemptive Base Rate cut in June, it would be necessary to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while further monitoring progress in the implementation of macroeconomic policies.",
        "The member noted that, on top of the preemptive Base Rate cut, if the government pushes ahead with its announced 10-trillion-won supplementary budget, Korea is expected to cope effectively with the contractions in consumer and investor confidence stemming from corporate restructuring.",
        "The member then presented the view that the effects of accommodative monetary policy should be monitored not only from a cyclical perspective, but also from the perspectives of risk factors, such as foreign exchange and financial market stability and household debt.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that, as household lending continues to grow and real estate prices have risen, led by reconstructed apartments in some districts of Seoul, the real estate market should be monitored closely, bearing in mind the possibility of price instability spreading to the rest of the country.",
        "The member also commented that the possibility of collective loans going bad should be examined.",
        "The member then noted that, although the financial markets are showing a trend of stability, recovering from the Brexit vote shock thanks to major countries’ aggressive policy measures, destabilizing factors still remain in the banking sectors of Italy, Germany and other European countries, and the Brexit issue could also affect the financial and real economy for a considerable period of time, and thus preparation should be made to deal with these issues in the medium to long-term horizon.",
        "Meanwhile, the member took the view that the Board should maintain its monetary easing stance going forward, even if the Base Rate remains unchanged this month.",
        "The member also emphasized that the active easing would allow the Board to cope with downside risks to the economy and employment expected in the second half, and to play the role of supplementing and supporting the successful structural reform of the Korean economy.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that, in overall consideration of the financial and economic environment, it would be proper to keep the Base Rate unchanged at this juncture.",
        "First, in terms of the real economy, the member judged the domestic economy to have shown a trend of improvement, with sales of durables and semi-durables beginning to increase in May on the demand side, and manufacturing production rebounding on the production side as well.",
        "However, the member assessed that, on the international front, with long-term interest rates at home and abroad falling substantially due mainly to the materialization of Brexit, uncertainties surrounding the Japanese economy have heightened owing primarily to uncertainty over the timing of the US Fed’s rate hikes, the strengthening of negative yields on Japanese government bonds, and a rise in the value of the yen.",
        "In overall judgement of these factors, the member took the view that, on the domestic economic front, aggregate demand conditions as exemplified by domestic consumption and construction have improved, due mainly to the Base Rate cuts since August 2014 and the government measure to ease household credit, while on the international economic front, foreign demand has dropped, owing primarily to the vulnerability of the Chinese economy and the mixed effects from Abenomics in Japan.",
        "The member, meanwhile, assessed prices to be following the expected path, and forecast that, although labor market-side inflationary pressures were not high, inflation would rise gradually by the end of the first half of next year with the effects from the decline in oil prices easing.",
        "While expecting economic trends not to break from the pattern in the first half, the member expressed the opinion that there were risk factors at home and abroad, such as Brexit, persistent uncertainties surrounding the Japanese and Chinese economies, and restructuring of domestic companies.",
        "The member, however, expected the June Base Rate cut by the Monetary Policy Board and the government's supplementary budget for the second half to act as buffers against these downside risks to the Korean economy.",
        "The member then assessed the growth forecast of 2.7% for this year to be neutral at this juncture, under the premise of 3% GDP growth in the first half.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level for the time being, it was necessary to closely monitor future macroeconomic trends.",
        "The member noted that there still were downside risks to the macroeconomy stemming from mounting uncertainties arising from Brexit, as well as from restructuring of vulnerable industries in the second half of this year.",
        "The member, however, commented that the government's supplementary budget would act as a partial buffer against downside risks to the economy in the second half, the effects from the Base Rate cut in June were expected to work to improve the economy somewhat going forward, and the extent of downward adjustment in the growth forecast was small relative to those in the past.",
        "The member then judged that these factors suggested that the actual macroeconomic trends were not diverging significantly from expected levels.",
        "The member also took into account that, although consumer price inflation still remained very low, it was expected to gradually converge to around the 2% target next year, given the recent international oil price movements and core inflation.",
        "Accordingly, the member argued that it was desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level and analyze developments in economic conditions, and that it was necessary to make efforts to preemptively strengthen macroprudential soundness to prevent the spillover effects of any possible negative shocks from spreading.",
        "The member also stressed the need for decisive and principled restructuring and for close cooperation with the relevant authorities concerning decisive household debt measures.",
        "Another member took the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period and closely monitoring the effects of expansionary macroeconomic policy, it would be good to carefully examine the trends of household debt growth, housing market conditions, the spillover effects from Brexit, and capital flow trends.",
        "The member noted that, although the outlooks for GDP growth and consumer price inflation were revised slightly downward this time, the Monetary Policy Board had cut the Base Rate by 25 basis points at the June policy decision meeting in anticipation of increasing downside risks to growth and inflation.",
        "The member then expressed the view that this measure was likely to contribute to a recovery in demand, with some time lag, and the government's scheduled budget expansion measures, including the compilation of the supplementary budget, would be helpful in supporting growth.",
        "The member also stressed that greater attention should be paid to financial stability risk factors, including first, that with household lending maintaining strong growth, housing prices, which are closely interconnected with household lending, were rising sharply, albeit only in certain areas; and second, that there was a possibility of heightened volatility in the financial markets at home and abroad, due mainly to uncertainty related to Brexit.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the improvements in the euro area, although weak, have continued.",
        "The Chinese economy has meanwhile maintained its moderate growth.",
        "The Board forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including uncertainties related to Britain’s exit from the European Union, changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries.",
        "- Looking at the Korean economy, while the sentiments of economic agents have been sluggish, the trend of decline in exports has continued but domestic demand activities including consumption appear to be improving.",
        "On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in June compared to those in June of last year.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",

        "In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase.",

        "As to international financial markets, members evaluated that global stock prices and interest rates had risen rapidly and the US dollar had strengthened, influenced mainly by the policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and expectations concerning the new US government’s policies.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed it as having continued to grow, albeit slowly, as exports showed a slight increase but domestic demand activities exhibited sluggish movements with facilities and construction investment declining.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members evaluated that long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had risen, influenced mainly by the steep rise in US Treasury yields, that stock prices had slightly rebounded after having declined, owing in part to the weakening of investment sentiment, and that bank household lending had sustained its persistently high rate of increase, led by mortgage loans.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had registered 1.3%, unchanged from the previous month’s level, and that core inflation had fallen slightly from 1.5% in the previous month to 1.4%.",

        "One member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on the future developments of downside risks in line with the recently soaring uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "The member noted that, although the world economy had been continuing its gradual recovery, close attention should be paid to the possibility of financial instability in vulnerable emerging market economies in line with increased protectionism and US interest rate normalization.",
        "The member, meanwhile, judged that the domestic financial markets had remained stable overall, and that the recent sharp increases in long-term interest rates were attributable to the normalization of the yield curve.",
        "The member also assessed the foreign exchange market as having the capacity to absorb external shocks to some extent, thanks to the current account surplus and a steady fall in the ratio of short-term external debt to official foreign reserves.",
        "The member, however, pointed out the possibility of the overall economy falling short of the originally forecast path, considering the trends of decrease in the manufacturing capacity utilization ratio and in services production.",
        "The member then went on to emphasize that attention should be paid to the fact that there had been heightened downside risks to the overall macroeconomy stemming from increased uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "Concerning consumer price inflation, the member noted that there had not been any marked underlying upward trend of prices, despite the rebound of oil prices and the easing of concerns about global deflation.",
        "The member then raised the concern that, against this backdrop, if downside risks materialize, the negative output gap could increase, thus gradually lowering the possibility of inflation converging to the target.",
        "Accordingly, the member stated the view that it was desirable at this juncture to assess the direction of future interest rate policy based on a detailed analysis of the degree to which downside risks to growth and inflation would increase.",
        "In addition, to reduce the remaining uncertainty in the markets over the direction of monetary policy amid the US Fed’s monetary policy normalization, the member stressed that Korea’s monetary policy should be implemented in accordance with Korea’s own macroeconomic and financial market conditions.",
        "The member went on to add that an active role for fiscal policy should be emphasized, considering the current macroeconomic trends.",
        "Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that, although the domestic economy was expected to maintain a modest trend of growth, downside risks to growth were judged to have increased, due mainly to growing uncertainties in conditions at home and abroad and to the resulting contraction in economic sentiment.",
        "The member then noted, however, that since there was a high level of uncertainty, the Bank should closely and comprehensively examine changes in conditions and the resulting impacts to predict the future growth path.",
        "Second, the member stated that it would be necessary to keep a close watch on how that day’s Fed rate hike and policy rate projections by the FOMC meeting participants would affect international financial markets and domestic financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "The member also noted that the Bank needed to pay attention to the possibility that heightened volatility in the financial and foreign exchange markets could recur, depending on the pace of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization and changes in political conditions at home and abroad going forward.",
        "Finally, the member found it difficult to be optimistic that the trend of household debt growth would stabilize next year, since demand for home mortgage lending was expected to be strong, led by apartments under construction that had already been sold, despite policy efforts to curb household debt.",
        "Accordingly, the member noted that it would be better to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that as both downside risks to the macroeconomy and financial stability risks were increasing amid heightened uncertainties, monetary policy alone could not ensure economic and financial stability, and so the role of fiscal policy was important.",
        "The member stated that when there was a high level of uncertainty within the economy, fiscal policy, which brings about direct effects, could be a more effective policy instrument than monetary policy, whose effects spread through indirect channels.",
        "The member went on to note that monetary easing could increase financial stability risks, for instance by increasing foreign portfolio investment outflow pressures and making it difficult to rein in household debt growth.",
        "Therefore, the member argued that the Bank should actively consult with the government to ensure that fiscal policy could be operated in a more expansionary manner.",
        "Meanwhile, one member took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in overall consideration of factors such as household debt that cause financial instability and the heightened uncertainties concerning domestic and overseas conditions, despite a slight increase in downside risks to the recent real economy and next year’s inflation.",
        "With regard to the real economy, the member assessed Korea’s economic growth as having peaked in the second quarter of 2016 and then having slowed afterwards, with the index of all industry production consumption and construction investment, showing slower growth.",
        "On the other hand, the member positively evaluated exports, saying that exports to China and the US had all shifted to increases, led primarily by those of semiconductors, and that exports had become more likely to maintain their upward trend going forward.",
        "In terms of prices, meanwhile, the member mentioned that consumer price inflation had accelerated on a rebound of oil prices since September 2016, while core inflation had slowed in reflection of the economic slowdown, and evaluated that factors such as the widening of the negative output gap and the disappearing of the base-period effect from oil price declines could act as downward pressures on inflation from 2017 onwards.",
        "Concerning financial stability, the member forecast the household debt growth rate to stabilize gradually, as house buyer sentiment had contracted since the government’s real estate measures announced on November 3, 2016 and the upward trend of housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas had been showing signs of stabilization, although household debt had maintained strong growth at the 10 percent level in November.",
        "However, the member assessed that it was still difficult to expect overall household debt growth to stabilize, due to the sustained growth in other loans extended by the banking sector and in mortgage lending by non-bank financial institutions.",
        "The member went on to stress the need for stronger risk management at non-bank financial institutions.",
        "One member mentioned that, although accommodative monetary policy had been implemented in consideration of real economic conditions, this had presupposed financial stability to a certain extent, and that it was therefore time to enhance the comprehensive coordination of policies, including fiscal policy and structural and regulatory reforms.",
        "The member also assessed the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike that had signalled the end of ultra-loose monetary policy as having provided more maneuvering room for the Korean monetary policy authorities.",
        "The member, however, expressed the view that, considering the sustained external uncertainties, the increased downside risks forecast in the domestic economic outlook, and the expectation that the price path would fall slightly below its estimate, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member also emphasized the following points with respect to the responses of the Korean economy to the trend of low interest rates and the implications of the US rate hike for the Korean economy.",
        "First, the member expressed the concern that the recent accommodative policy stance had been supporting the Korean economy but capital had been concentrated in the real estate sector, which could threaten financial stability going forward.",
        "Next, the member pointed out that Korea’s yield curve had steepened, affected by US monetary policy, and this could help ease the issue of ineffective distribution in the real economy.",
        "However, the member also noted that vigilance was needed against the possibility that rate hikes in advanced countries unaccompanied by real economic recoveries could work to worsen global financial market unrest.",
        "Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that concerning the trend of growth at home, growth had continued to depend on domestic demand, such as consumption and construction investment, as external demand still had not shown sufficient improvement despite signs that the export sluggishness had eased somewhat.",
        "The member went on to note that the downside risks to the growth path had been increasing gradually with manufacturing production continuing to slow down and production in the construction and services sectors weakening somewhat.",
        "Second, the member stated that consumer price inflation had remained at the previous month’s level, but core inflation had decelerated somewhat due mainly to a fall in the prices of non-petroleum industrial products.",
        "The member commented that, although consumer price inflation was expected to accelerate gradually with the downward trend of import and producer prices coming to an end, there were various upside and downside risks for the future price path on the regulatory and supply sides, such as electricity tariff revision, oil prices, exchange rates and agricultural product prices.",
        "Third, the member stated that, although inventory adjustment pressures had been decreasing, the substantially increased slack seemed to have gradually set in, with the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector remaining at its record low level and demand-side pressures from facilities investment decreasing for the second consecutive month.",
        "The slack in the labor force had been overall showing weaker improvement, with the average time gap, including the time-related underemployed, increasing slightly and the participation gap, including potential job seekers, declining at a slower pace than during the same month last year.",
        "Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, growth in domestic long- and short-term interest rates and the exchange rate had stabilized with the easing of the surge in long-term interest rates immediately after the US presidential election, but market instability had been increasing due chiefly to the resumption of Fed rate hikes and the upward adjustment to the Fed’s rate hike projection.",
        "Furthermore, despite household debt management measures, household debt had continued to grow regardless of households’ income conditions, and rising lending rates had worked to increase debt payment burdens and the risk of vulnerable borrowers going bankrupt.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends, slack in production and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member mentioned that Korea’s economic outlook for next year was not bright, with domestic and overseas risks to the Korean economy increasing further.",
        "The member also took the view that amid sluggish private consumption and facilities investment, construction investment, which had contributed greatly to growth, was also expected to slow down.",
        "He added that exports were likely to improve compared to this year, boosted by the global economic recovery, but the trend of protectionism was expected to have negative effects.",
        "In addition, the member argued that considering employment instability and the level of excess production capacity in the manufacturing sector, the real economy was likely to be sluggish and the situation seemed to require accommodative monetary policy.",
        "However, the member pointed out that there also remained uncertainties concerning monetary policy, including US rate hikes and household debt.",
        "The member stressed that, although the Korean economy was not likely to be affected heavily by US rate hikes, vigilance needed to be maintained considering the current high uncertainties, and went on to emphasize that, concerning household debt, constant monitoring was needed of real estate market conditions and the effects of various government household debt measures.",
        "The member also assessed that, in response to the recent surge in long-term market interest rates, the Bank of Korea had made appropriate measures to ease market unrest by buying Treasury bonds and reducing the issuance of monetary stabilization bonds, and that since excessive interest rate hikes within a short period of time could increase corporate and household burdens and undermine financial market stability, efforts should be maintained to closely monitor their effects and make appropriate responses if needed.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "trend of steady economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth.",
        "The euro area has also continued its improvements.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate recovery going forward, while being affected by factors such as the directions of the new government's economic policies and the pace of monetary policy normalization in the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries.",
        "but the improvements in domestic demand activities have been weak.",
        "On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in November was higher than that in November of last year, as the number of persons employed increased.",
        "The unemployment rate meanwhile maintained the same level as in November last year.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, in line with a recovery of the global economy, but judges that the downside risks to the future growth path have expanded a bit, owing chiefly to the high degrees of uncertainty in recent domestic and external conditions.",
        "October despite the extent of decline in petroleum product prices having narrowed, as the pace of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum slowed.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 1.4%, from prices have shown upward trends, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas.",
        "Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the effects of the increases in international oil prices.",
        "by expectations concerning the new US government's economic policies and the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have risen.",
        "The Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rate has meanwhile fallen, in line with the yen’s relative weakening.",
        "Stock prices have rebounded after having declined, owing in part to increases in global stock prices.",
        "The extent of growth in household lending has expanded, led by home mortgage loans.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the euro area recovery had somewhat weakened with major sentiment indexes slowing, China’s economic slowdown had continued with its exports decreasing significantly, and the US economy was maintaining modest growth with consumption and employment indexes improving.",
        "As to international financial markets, most members evaluated Treasury bond yields in major countries as having fallen, generally due to concerns about a global economic slowdown and expectations of additional easing measures by the ECB, and stock prices as having started to rise, influenced largely by increases in international oil prices.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that the recovery had slowed due to the continued sluggishness of exports and domestic demand.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that, with international financial market instability having eased, outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds had slowed and stock prices had rebounded significantly since mid-February, and the won-dollar rate had fallen back substantially since the beginning of March.",
        "As to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had stood at 1.3 percent, a substantial increase from the previous month, due mainly to sharp increases in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also increased slightly month-on-month to 1.8%.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member evaluated that, on the external side, there had been a possibility of greater volatility in the international financial markets, and on the domestic side, there had been no driving force triggering a shift in the economic trend due to sluggish exports and domestic demand, and the member also stated that keen attention should be paid to financial stability issues, such as outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds or growth in household and corporate debt.",
        "The member went on to state the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, attention should be paid to various risks at home and abroad and efforts should be made to discover momentum for improvement in economic activities and to maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The member stressed that it would be necessary to address the uncertainties felt by economic agents and stop self-reinforcing dynamic adaptation, while sharing the view that it was difficult to expect the domestic economy to grow at more than a modest pace in a situation where exports were unlikely to recover easily.",
        "The member also expressed the view that, as the shadow of a crisis cast by global macroeconomic adjustments now taking place in China and EMEs following the US and Europe was revealing itself in slightly different forms of volatility, various external volatility issues needed to be addressed carefully.",
        "The member went on to mention the need for the monitoring and continuous management of household debt risks and added that promotion of greater use of non-recourse Didimdol loans or mortgage insurances would help reduce vulnerable households’ debt risks.",
        "The member also presented the views that attention should be paid to the significance and future impact of persistently low growth that added to financial instability, that new technology-based services should be further reflected in GDP statistics, and that efforts should be strengthened to comprehensively analyze various information variables and identify the relationship between business and financial cycles in order to expand monetary policy infrastructure.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to cut this month’s Base Rate by 25 basis points from the current 1.5% to contribute substantially to the easing the worsening of economic sentiment, to improvements in exports and domestic demand, and to stabilization of the financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Based on the member’s evaluation that global monetary easing was very likely to expand going forward and that global interest rates would remain at ultra low levels for the time being even if the US normalizes its monetary policy, the member stressed that it would be necessary for the Korean economy, with its high dependence upon external trade and high degree of financial openness, to adapt itself flexibly to the easing stances of its major trading partners.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that the risk of further foreign capital outflows and greater household debt, having been pointed out as potential policy costs to be incurred by additional rate cuts, had been substantially decreasing recently, and that monetary policy divergence among the US and other major countries was likely to expand, which would limit the Korean monetary authorities’ policy space.",
        "In addition, the member put forward his view that the related policy authorities should look more closely at economic developments and seek appropriate preemptive measures in order to prevent the formation of a vicious circle in which sluggish economic indicators arouse anxiety among economic agents, leading to a delay in consumption and investment, which in turnerm would make the Korean economy less resilient.",
        "The member went on to argue that the policy authorities should work hard to improve economic sentiment by conveying their policy intentions more clearly and by ensuring that they are equipped with various policy instruments and are prepared to implement them.",
        "One other member put forward the view that, although prices had risen temporarily, there had been no major changes in the overall trend, and that, amid slightly weakening signs of improvement in economic activities during January and February, downside risks seemed to have increased somewhat, due mainly to the persistent sluggishness of external demand and the weakening of economic sentiment.",
        "The member went on to state that, amid the current structurally weakened economic recovery, providing stimulus through policy rate adjustment had some limitations, and thus it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while waiting and observing changes in the monetary policies of the ECB and the US Federal Reserve, movements of international oil prices, and domestic economic situation.",
        "The member also noted that, although the domestic economy was likely to maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around domestic demand, the uncertainties surrounding the growth path going forward were still judged to be high, as the recovery of consumption was likely to be limited due to the weakening of household confidence amid persistently sluggish exports stemming from a shortage of external demand.",
        "The member also argued that, since inflows/outflows of foreign securities investment funds were greatly affected by external factors, a close watch should be kept on the possibility that outward pressures of foreign securities investment funds would grow again, if economic instabilities in EMEs increase again or if there is any change in the monetary policies of major central banks.",
        "Meanwhile, one member set forth a number of points that the Board consider in its operation of appropriate monetary policy.",
        "First, as the effects of sluggish exports, which had thus far been confined to the manufacturing sector, were gradually spreading to the service sector, economic sentiment and the recovery of domestic demand both had weakened.",
        "As a result, growth in the first quarter had fallen short of the original forecast, and thus there was an increased possibility of a widening negative GDP gap.",
        "Second, as underlying upward trends of consumer price inflation and core inflation continued and inflation expectations remained stable, disinflationary pressure was gradually weakening.",
        "However, there was a need for a little more observation to determine whether demand-side upward pressures on core inflation would increase sufficiently to reach an appropriate inflation level over a medium-term horizon.",
        "Third, slack in the production sector had expanded further, and although slack in the labor market had improved slightly, it was concentrated in relatively vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, although an overall consideration of these points could lead to the conclusion that there is room for further Base Rate adjustments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and to closely examine the extent of actual changes in the growth and price paths and factors causing financial instability at home and abroad, thus maintaining a flexible policy stance.",
        "The member also expressed the opinion that, concerning future policy operation, the Board should cautiously examine changes in the policies of major countries, keep a close eye on their effects on the domestic markets and the consequent changes related to risks of capital outflows, and thoroughly analyze major expected monetary policy transmission channels and the policy effects, in consideration of changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The member went on to mention that the Board should pay attention to the fact that, at this stage, the positive effects of monetary policy could be maximized and its negative side effects could be minimized only if it is implemented as part of an appropriate policy mix, including the implementation of structural reform, the expansion of the role of fiscal policy, and the effective operation of macroprudential policy.",
        "Another member put forward the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and closely examine changes in external conditions, including international oil prices, the monetary policies of major countries, inflows/outflows of foreign investment funds, and movements of price variables in the financial markets.",
        "The member commented that, although downside risks to growth and inflation had increased somewhat since the January forecast, uncertainty over external economic conditions was high, and thus it was necessary to maintain a closer examination of future changes in conditions in order to effectively assess the underlying trends of growth and inflation.",
        "The member went on to state the necessity of closely monitoring the effects on the Korean economy of the recent rebound in international oil prices and of the monetary policy decisions of the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and other major country central banks scheduled for this month.",
        "The member also put forward the view that, although financial markets at home and abroad were showing a somewhat stable pattern of movements, it was difficult to say that financial market uncertainty had fundamentally eased, so even a minor shock might cause a reoccurrence of heightened market volatility.",
        "One other member put forward the view that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member then noted three options that could be considered to manage household debt, which presently stands at more than 1,200 trillion won.",
        "The member stated that the first option--partial debt write-offs--does not address the root of the problem, and the second option, which is to curb the pace of increase in household debt, could cause a conflict between economic recovery and financial stability.",
        "The member then stressed the necessity of looking into the third option, which is to boost the housing rental market.",
        "Through this option, debt that is concentrated in the household sector can be transferred to other sectors.",
        "In this regard, the member stated the view that there was an urgent need to collect micro-data related to household debt in order to gain an understanding of the exact state of household debt in Korea, including lending to self-employed business operators and the debt of unregistered landlords, and to set up a system of managing such data systemically.",
        "The member noted that, for actual residential households, it was necessary to reduce demand for housing purchases and leasehold deposit-based rentals by promoting the housing rental industry to ensure that the corporate and public sectors could purchase and rent houses on a monthly basis.",
        "Specifically, the member proposed two policy alternatives; first, to have corporations consider expanding their investment in houses by building accommodations for their employees, and second, to have pension funds actively participate in the housing rental business.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "Mr. Seong Keun Ha, however, dissented, expressing his clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at its current level, and arguing for lowering it by 0.25 of a percentage point.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the US economy has emerged from its temporary slowdown and shown a trend of moderate growth.",
        "However, the trend of economic recovery in the euro area has weakened somewhat, while economic growth in emerging market countries including China has continued to slow.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will be affected by factors such as financial and economic conditions in China and other emerging market countries, international oil price movements, and global financial market volatility.",
        "and the weakening recovery of domestic demand activities such as consumption are continuing, while the sentiments of economic agents have been sluggish.",
        "On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has steadily increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose in January compared to that in January last year, while the unemployment rate fell.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",
        "□ Consumer price inflation rose to a significant extent in February, from 0.8% the month before to 1.3%, owing chiefly to increases in agricultural product prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices meanwhile rose slightly to 1.8%, from price inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the low oil prices.",
        "In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "market recovery and by a subsiding of foreigners’ securities investment fund outflows, stock prices have risen sharply since February and the Korean won, after having depreciated, has appreciated to a considerable extent against the US dollar.",
        "The won has meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen, in line with the yen’s strengthening.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have rebounded slightly after having declined, in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",

        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the monetary policies of major countries or in financial and economic conditions in China, the movements of capital flows, geopolitical risks, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy had shown robust growth with its employment indicators improving, that although markets had quickly steadied after the Brexit shock, the trend of recovery in the euro area had weakened due mainly to sluggish exports, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its growth, led by consumption.",
        "As to international financial markets, some members evaluated that global stock prices had risen substantially, lifted by expectations for additional monetary easing by major countries, while international oil prices had fallen sharply on weakened expectations for resolving the oversupply issue.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, most members assessed that, while the sluggishness of exports had continued, domestic demand had improved modestly, with consumption and construction investment picking up.",
        "However, uncertainties surrounding the growth path were judged to be increasing.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that stock prices had risen and the won-dollar rate had plunged, as expectations for monetary policy easing in major countries and improved global risk appetite induced inflows of foreign portfolio investment.",
        "Furthermore, they judged long-term market interest rates to show slight fluctuations at very low levels.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had fallen from 0.8% the month before to 0.7%, in line with a slowdown in service fee growth as the effects of public transport fare hikes dissipated.",
        "They also commented that core inflation had fallen slightly month-on-month to 1.6 percent.",
        "Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as domestic and overseas economic conditions had not changed much from the previous month and economic growth had been holding to the existing forecast path.",
        "The member also presented the view that, as the Korean economic structure had been rebalanced toward domestic demand and services and away from exports and manufacturing, attention should be paid to the interpretation of various economic indicators as well.",
        "The member stressed that, for example, since there had been a shift in the focus of investment demand from volume to knowledge production, attention should be directed toward improvement in investment quality, rather than the amount invested.",
        "The member also emphasized that it was more important at this juncture to focus on appropriate changes and innovations in goods, including manufactured and service goods, rather than on growth in manufacturing production.",
        "The member judged that, given the structural changes in the Korean economy, reduced productivity, population aging, and monetary easing in major advanced countries, it was necessary to maintain a low interest rate stance for the time being.",
        "The member, however, noted that, since the ultimate goals of monetary policy were to achieve potential growth and maintain inflation at the target level by revitalizing consumption and investment while securing financial stability, much thought should continue to be given to the most effective ways to harmonize macroprudential and monetary policy tools to achieve these goals.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period, it would be best to keep a careful watch on changes in risks to the macroeconomy and financial stability.",
        "The member stressed that, taking into overall consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, special attention should be paid to two points in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, uncertainties surrounding economic growth and the price path were very high.",
        "Second, despite measures to improve the quality of household debt, risks to financial stability were increasing as the amount of such debt continued to sustain strong growth.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that a careful watch should be kept on growth in household debt, developments in asset markets, progress in corporate restructuring, monetary policy changes in major countries and protectionist stirrings.",
        "Another member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that risk factors in the second half, such as corporate restructuring, the anti-solicitation law and a possible resumption of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, had already been reflected in the July forecasts, and therefore it was too soon to predict that growth would depart significantly from the forecast path.",
        "Second, the member argued that the downside risks to the price path for the second half were increasing, due mainly to the falls in oil prices and the strengthening of the won against the dollar.",
        "Third, the member pointed out that there had been no significant improvements with respect to the slack in the manufacturing sector, which had increased substantially in line with weakening production resulting chiefly from the worsening export slump, and went on to state that overall labor market slack continued to improve in July but potential labor market instability had increased.",
        "Based on an overall examination of labor market slack and the trends in inflation and the real economy, the member argued that while keeping the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to examine the spillover effects of the previous Base Rate cut and observe how things progressed with the supplementary budget while keeping a careful watch on the developments and related effects of the above-mentioned factors, which are giving rise to uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "The member added that, as the Base Rate had decreased to its lowest level in history, various risk factors were becoming apparent in terms of financial stability, including increased household lending by non-bank financial institutions and the possibility of greater risk-taking incentives for financial institutions, and accordingly close monitoring was required and preemptive action should be taken as necessary.",
        "Meanwhile, another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period, given that construction investment and consumption had led economic growth during the second quarter of this year, that the economy in July had not deviated far from the forecast, and that headline inflation was expected to converge to the medium-term inflation target in the first half of next year.",
        "First, looking at business activities, the member stated that considering the fast growth in housing construction since the second half of last year, construction investment, particularly in housing construction, would likely experience corrections, which the member judged as desirable.",
        "Furthermore, the member evaluated consumption as having shown gradual improvement if the effects of the slowdown in automobile sales resulting from the termination of individual consumption tax cuts in June were excluded.",
        "In terms of propensities for consumption, meanwhile, the member expressed the view that the average propensity to consume (APC) had declined since 2011, and that attention needed to be paid to the fact that the APC had declined much more among homeowners compared to non-homeowners during the past five years.",
        "The member also assessed that this phenomenon was likely attributable either to the fall in the values of assets held by homeowners in line with the declines in housing prices from went on to state that, given that housing price rises prior to 2010 were not seen as a bubble, that the delinquency rate of household loans remained low, and that the recent sharp increase in household loans had been supported by the borrowing capacities of households, the increased precautionary savings of senior homeowners might have had a major impact on the decline in their APC, and their longer residual life expectancies might have acted as a factor accelerating this decline.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member put forward the view that, since household lending had grown rapidly since 2014, a careful watch on the soundness of the household sector balance sheet was imperative in order to seek the optimal mix of monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies from the second half of this year.",
        "Finally, in terms of inflation, the member assessed that, although July’s headline inflation stood at 0.7 percent due to low oil prices and exchange rates, the headline inflation forecast of nearly 2 percent for the first half of next year was still valid, with the effects of oil price declines fading away and inflation rising gradually.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to keep an eye on future macroeconomic developments while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent.",
        "The member noted that, while no significant change had been seen with respect to anemic global growth, markets had steadied quickly after the Brexit shock, and this had helped ease the risk aversion of global finance capital, leading to a resumption of capital flows into Korea and other EMEs.",
        "On the domestic side, the member’s assessment was that, although exports had remained sluggish, construction investment had continued to pick up and consumption indicators in May and June had also been relatively favorable.",
        "However, the member judged that with housing prices stabilizing in line with the sharp increase in the housing supply, the driving force behind the currently favorable construction investment was likely to gradually weaken.",
        "Moreover, the member assessed that the recovery of consumption indicators was largely attributable to the one-off factor of individual consumption tax cuts on automobiles, and thus it did not necessarily imply a further continuation of consumption recovery.",
        "The member also called attention to the fact that a tangible recovery of exports was unlikely in the short term, and that a careful watch needed to be kept on macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from the restructuring of vulnerable sectors and on the growing possibility that inflation might fall somewhat short of the original forecast path.",
        "In this regard, the member considered it appropriate to monitor future macroeconomic developments while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member also stressed that an improvement in the soundness of household debt was a necessary condition for a more flexible monetary policy.",
        "Another member pointed to the need to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period and observe the progress of macroeconomic policy for a little while longer.",
        "The member mentioned that a preemptive Base Rate cut had been made in June this year and that the government’s supplementary budget combined with accommodative monetary policy would likely affect consumer and investor sentiment positively.",
        "The member went on to state that in-depth analyses should continue to be made of various risk factors, including the household debt issue, the stability of the financial markets amid changes in domestic and external conditions, the effects of corporate restructuring and the profitability of financial institutions.",
        "With regard to the household debt issue in particular, the member argued that it was necessary to closely examine the effects of the Base Rate cut on the growth in household debt, and also look at the shift to household loans issued by non-bank financial institutions rather than banks following implementation of a guideline to encourage banks to strengthen their mortgage application screening, along with the related effects and policy responses.",
        "In addition, the member put forward the view that, although the international financial market and the Korean FX market had stabilized following the Brexit decision, it would be necessary to monitor the FX market, in which excessive unidirectional expectations seemed to have formed, and the member also stated that the possibility that changed circumstances could lead to another US Federal Reserve rate hike should not be overlooked.",
        "In addition, the member mentioned that attention must be paid to the effects of corporate restructuring on the profitability of financial institutions and on the financial markets, and also to the possibility of a bond market crunch, while examining how continuously low interest rates have affected the profitability and investment patterns of financial institutions.",
        "Finally, the member stressed that the central bank should pay careful attention to the risk factors mentioned above while maintaining its monetary easing policy.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",

        "However, the improvements in the euro area have weakened.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the uncertainties related to Britain’s exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries.",

        "On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in July of last year.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",

        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.7% in June.",
        "In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase.",
        "Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices diminish.",
        "and the Korean won has appreciated to a large extent against the US dollar, as foreigners’ securities investment funds have shown net inflows owing chiefly to expectations of monetary policy easing in major countries.",
        "The won has meanwhile appreciated against the Japanese yen, in line with the won’s relative strengthening.",
        "Long-term market interest rates have shown slight fluctuations at low levels.",

        "In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the modest recovery in the euro area economy had been sustained, the Chinese economic downturn had eased, boosted by the government’s aggressive policy measures, and the recovery in the US economy had weakened somewhat.",
        "As to international financial markets, most members evaluated global stock prices and Treasury bond yields in major countries as having risen and then fallen back overall and the US dollar as having remained slightly weak against major currencies, due chiefly to the run-up in international oil prices and global economic movements.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed that exports remained sluggish, but that consumption and investment appeared to be improving.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, some members evaluated that, with international financial market volatility having been increased by sluggish global economic indicators, stock prices and long-term market interest rates had fallen back after having risen and the won-dollar rate had rebounded after having fallen gradually.",
        "As to prices, some members noted that consumer price inflation had stood at 1.0 percent as in the previous month, and that core inflation had increased slightly month-on-month to 1.8 percent.",
        "are posted on the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member presented the view that, taking into overall consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, the global economy, having shown a slow recovery, appeared to have stabilized for the moment, and the domestic economy was expected to sustain its current growth, led by domestic demand.",
        "The member went on to argue that it would be therefore desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member expected the trend of decline in exports to ease and commented that, although fiscal tightening was expected in the second half of this year as a result of the frontloading of the budget, Korea’s macroeconomic policy would likely be neutral overall, with previous Base Rate cuts having led to declines in market interest rates.",
        "Meanwhile, the member emphasized that the Korean economy was in urgent need of structural reform as its growth strategy had reached its limit amid low global economic growth.",
        "The member also stressed that it would be necessary to enhance the effectiveness of interest rate policy and make careful use of the remainder of the interest rate policy space, as propensities for consumption had been changing in accordance with population ageing.",
        "The member then expressed the view that vigilance was needed in order to avoid falling into a liquidity trap in the medium and long term.",
        "Another member set forth a number of points for the Bank of Korea to consider in its operation of appropriate monetary policy.",
        "First, with the slumps in exports and manufacturing production continuing, there were significant uncertainties as to the future growth path and as to whether the present economic recovery dependent on fiscal policy could persist, and there were also domestic and overseas risk factors, including corporate restructuring and Brexit, and so a careful watch was needed on whether economic growth after the second quarter of this year would reach the potential growth rate, as had been forecast.",
        "Second, although consumer price inflation and core inflation had maintained their gradual uptrends— consistent with their forecasts—and although disinflationary pressures were projected to weaken gradually, demand-side inflationary pressures seemed insufficient to produce an appropriate level of inflation.",
        "Third, enormous slack remained in the production sector, and although labor market slack had improved slightly, there were growing imbalances and potential instability caused by structural factors and corporate restructuring.",
        "Taking all of this into overall consideration, the member expressed the view that, although conditions had been created that could support further Base Rate adjustments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "At the same time, the member went on to state that it would be necessary to monitor whether growth and consumer prices show trends consistent with their forecasts, to closely examine domestic and overseas risks, such as household debt, the effects of corporate restructuring on the credit and labor markets, and China’s corporate debt risks, and to secure policy space for flexible Base Rate adjustments.",
        "One other member proposed that the Base Rate should remain at its current level, judging that a narrowing of the GDP and inflation gaps was still expected, despite expanded downside risks to the economy.",
        "The member assessed downside risks to growth as having expanded somewhat, with the trend of economic recovery slowing between January and April this year compared to the latter half of 2015.",
        "The member then presented the view that, in order for the economy to achieve growth at the upper-2% level, it was important for growth in private consumption, which is the biggest component of aggregate demand, to be at the 2% level, but the recent signs of weakened recovery in private consumption might act to expand downside risks to real economic growth over both the short-term and the medium- to long-term horizons.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that consumer price inflation remained low, running significantly below the medium-term inflation target of 2% due to continued declines in producer and import prices.",
        "The member then commented that a recovery in domestic demand, led by consumption, and the easing of the demand slump in major economies were important for future price conditions, and expected the CPI for 2016 to be only at the low-1% level.",
        "Lastly, from a financial stability perspective, the member noted that, while collective loans were excluded from the scope of the ‘Guideline on Banks’ Mortgage Loan Screening’, mortgage loans, and collective loans in particular, had shown somewhat heightened growth of late, in line with sustained rises in housing construction and in the stock of new apartments available for sale, both resulting from the introduction of a government measure in 2014 to encourage the provision of housing.",
        "The member went on to express the view that it was thus necessary to closely monitor changes in risks from a financial stability perspective, facing up to the fact that credit risk management for collective loans had been relatively neglected.",
        "Meanwhile, one member noted that, with the declining trend in inflation easing somewhat due to policy rate cuts, and deflationary pressures from abroad also diminishing due to the run-up in oil prices, the steep decline in exports had slowed and some sentiment indicators had partially rebounded, but inflation had been running below target for a long time, the economic recovery was still weak, and the upcoming corporate restructuring might increase downside risks to the macroeconomy in the short term.",
        "The member went on to express the opinion that, given these factors, while the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level, it was necessary to closely monitor downside risks to the macroeconomy going forward.",
        "In addition, the member commented that the restructuring of troubled companies, which had become an issue of late, and difficulties in monetary policy in the course of such restructuring exemplified the importance of curbing moral hazard by taking preemptive policy measures to strengthen financial soundness.",
        "The member stressed that, since the continuing rapid growth in household debt might increase potential economic risks and limit the flexibility of monetary policy, there was a need to strengthen policy related to household debt soundness through active policy cooperation with the relevant authorities.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, in determining this month’s Base Rate, a number of factors should be considered in addition to the overall domestic and overseas financial and economic conditions.",
        "First, looking at the recent macroeconomic trends, there seemed no significant changes in the upside and downside risks to growth and inflation since the April MPB meeting.",
        "From a financial stability perspective, although financial markets at home and abroad remained stable overall, there remained domestic and international risk factors that could reignite market volatility.",
        "On the domestic front, in particular, household debt was maintaining a persistently high rate of increase, and there was great uncertainty as to how corporate restructuring, which had emerged as one of the most difficult issues facing the economy, would affect financial institutions and financial markets.",
        "The member stated that it would therefore be better to keep a close watch on changes in economic conditions at home and abroad, and on the progress in corporate restructuring together with its financial and economic effects, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member presented the view that, in overall consideration of recent economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be necessary to cut the Base Rate at the earliest possible time, even if not this month.",
        "The member noted that, although the effects of monetary policy seemed to have weakened compared to those in the past, effects from both fiscal and monetary macroeconomic policy still clearly existed.",
        "Concerning the downwardly adjusted inflation outlook in April, the member stressed that with downside risks increasing, the Bank of Korea should conduct more accommodative monetary policy in preparation for the possibility that consumer price inflation could remain lower than the inflation target.",
        "The member also noted that, looking at overseas cases, although the adoption of negative interest rates by the ECB, Danmarks Nationalbank, the Riksbank, Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Japan had only limited spillover effects on real economies thus far, these policies had been effective in preventing excessive currency appreciation and thus maintaining stability in the foreign exchange markets of small and open economies.",
        "The member went on to present the view that, although the household debt problem was an important issue for monetary policy, if household debt was effectively managed through supervisory policy measures, there would be room for some degree of future monetary policy adjustment.",
        "The member then expressed the opinion that, against the backdrop of various risk factors surrounding the domestic economy, such as the possibility of further policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, the Chinese economic slowdown, commodity price declines, credit risk in Europe, and the possibility of Brexit, a preemptive policy rate cut would be an effective measure in preparation against external risk factors as well as from a counter-cyclical perspective.",

        "As to international financial markets, members evaluated that major price variables, such as global stocks, bonds and crude oil, had become more volatile, affected by the result of the US presidential election, uncertainties surrounding the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike, and weakening expectations of OPEC reducing its production.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed the growth momentum as weakening overall, with the continued trend of decline in exports and slowing improvements in domestic demand activities, such as retail sales and facilities and construction investment.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members evaluated that the volatility of major price variables, including interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, had increased, as also seen in the international financial markets, and that long-term market interest rates had risen substantially, affected chiefly by expectations of a US policy rate hike and rises in major country Treasury bond yields, while stock prices had fallen due to the increased uncertainties at home and abroad.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen from 1.2% the month before to 1.3% in October, owing chiefly to the expiration of a temporary cut in electricity fees, and that core inflation had also risen month-on-month.",

        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "With regard to the economic outlooks for the fourth quarter this year and for next year, the member noted growing uncertainties in line with the worsening of domestic and external conditions, and went on to argue that, looking at external factors, while the domestic and overseas financial markets had stabilized after having shown heightened volatility after the US presidential election, the possibility of a shift in the US government’s economic policies, such as moving toward protective trade policies, might have huge impacts on Korea’s real sector, and in-depth analyses of and preparations for this were therefore required.",
        "On the home front, the member stressed that more aggressive efforts should be made to cope with growing uncertainties as well as difficult economic conditions, and emphasized the need for a multifaceted analysis of and continuous policy attention on how the implementation of the anti-graft law and corporate restructuring had been affecting consumption, facilities investment and employment.",
        "The member also presented the view that, while continuing to examine risk factors such as the possibilities of a US Federal Reserve rate hike, a Chinese economic slowdown, and a post-Brexit global economic slowdown, thought should be given to whether further monetary easing would be needed should future economic conditions turn out to be worse than the current forecast.",
        "Meanwhile, the member stated that the household debt issue should be addressed based on steady examination of the effectiveness of related government measures.",
        "The member added that, considering various external soundness indicators, Korea was unlikely to be affected greatly by a US policy rate hike, but it would be necessary to work in closer cooperation with the government going forward while strengthening the monitoring of domestic and overseas financial market trends.",
        "Another member meanwhile mentioned a number of points that should be considered in this month’s Base Rate decision.",
        "First, the member expressed the view that uncertainties over the future growth path had increased due to factors such as the unexpected result of the US presidential election, but it would be necessary to observe a little longer to see how these factors would actually affect growth.",
        "Second, the member stated that although the financial and foreign exchange markets were stabilizing after having fluctuated significantly immediately after the US presidential election, there is a possibility that these markets could become volatile again considering the high uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas conditions.",
        "The member then stressed that a close eye should be kept on the possibility of further capital outflows and the heightening of financial and exchange market unrest.",
        "The member went on to argue that it should also be considered that the probability of a US Federal Reserve policy rate hike, having temporarily decreased after the US presidential election, had been rising again owing chiefly to the stabilization of financial markets and expectations of stronger inflationary pressures due to the incoming Trump administration’s proposed fiscal expansion.",
        "Regarding household debt growth and housing market conditions, meanwhile, the member presented the view that, although housing prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region had stabilized after the government’s announcement of its real estate measures on November 3, the housing market could be hardly seen as having become stable, given the sustained excessive demand for housing in popular regions such as Gangnam, Seoul, the persistent trend of low interest rates, and the continued easy availability of housing loans.",
        "In this regard, the member argued that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25% during the intermeeting period and closely monitor any changes in domestic and overseas uncertainties and the related impacts.",
        "Meanwhile, one member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that concerning the trend of growth at home, growth momentum had been weakening overall, as the trend of improvement in domestic demand including private consumption and construction investment had decelerated with the continued contraction in manufacturing production stemming from export sluggishness.",
        "The member noted that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had heightened further, as there were factors making for political and economic instability at home and abroad, and as the economy was expected to slow down in the fourth quarter, influenced for instance by discontinued production of some items, corporate restructuring and the anti-graft law.",
        "Second, consumer price inflation and core inflation had maintained their gradual uptrends, consistent with their October forecasts.",
        "The member commented that, going forward, consumer price inflation was expected to show a gradually faster pace of increase as the effects of low oil prices dissipate, and was anticipated to converge to near the target level in the first half of 2017.",
        "Third, slack in the production sector had not improved much, as the average capacity utilization ratio in the manufacturing sector continued at an all-time low due mainly to inventory adjustments, and as facilities investment demand pressures began to decrease.",
        "The member noted that, although overall labor force slack had been continuing to improve, the labor market had failed to improve in qualitative terms as growth in employment was seen mostly in self-employed businesses and in the low-wage services sectors.",
        "Fourth, looking at financial stability conditions, as short- and long-term interest rates rebounded and foreign bond investment registered a net outflow from the domestic financial markets, the yield curve had steepened, credit spreads of corporate bonds had widened, and stock price volatility had risen.",
        "The member also expressed the need for monitoring the effects of the government’s real estate measures, as household debt continued to grow faster than usual.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends, slack in production and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as inflation was not seen to have deviated greatly from the original forecast path and was expected to converge to near the inflation target over the medium-term horizon, despite growing uncertainties surrounding real economic conditions and exogenous variables.",
        "The member emphasized the following three points with respect to effectively achieving the Bank of Korea’s objectives.",
        "The member first pointed out that, although the growth engines that had weakened due to changes in the economic structure could be spurred to some extent through fiscal and monetary policies, there was an issue of resource distribution trade-offs between generations.",
        "Next, noting uncertain external variables, the member expressed the view that the heavy dependence of advanced economies on monetary policy to overcome the financial crisis had given rise to various side effects, and the expected US policy rate hike could pave the way for a shift in global interest rate trends.",
        "Finally, the member raised concerns about a bias toward accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The member presented the view that the introduction of unconventional measures to maintain low interest rates by advanced country central banks had failed to have the desired effects on the real economy because of an excessive reliance on monetary policy.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on the impacts of the recently soaring political and economic uncertainties at home and abroad on the future development of the Korean economy.",
        "The member judged the world economy to have maintained modest growth and the Korean economy to have continued its weak growth as well, as the boom in the construction market served as a buffer against sluggish exports.",
        "The member also evaluated that pressures for a further decline in underlying inflation had been easing gradually.",
        "The member, however, emphasized that a close watch should be kept on the impacts of the recently introduced anti-graft law and the government measures to stabilize the housing market.",
        "Looking ahead, the member stressed the need for paying special attention to greatly heightened uncertainties surrounding the Korean economy in line with sharply increasing political uncertainties in Korea and the US.",
        "Accordingly, the member suggested that the Bank of Korea should keep a close eye on how these uncertainties might change future Korean macroeconomic trends, while mitigating potential risk factors, such as the buildup of household debt, that could amplify the spillover effects of unforseen negative shocks.",
        "The member also expressed the need for harmonization with fiscal policy, which is less likely than monetary policy to bring about the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances in the private sector.",
        "One member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the recent inflation, economic and financial stability conditions, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "With respect to the real economy, the member noted that, despite continued robust growth in construction investment, the actual GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter may come in below the forecast because of weakened growth, as exemplified by the negative figures seen in September industrial production and retail sales and in October export growth.",
        "The member judged the uncertainty of the economic outlook to have heightened further as the unexpected US presidential election result had cast uncertainty on whether the world trade volume would recover, although the growth pattern of recoveries in exports and facilities investment serving as a buffer against slower construction investment was expected for 2017.",
        "Meanwhile, the member evaluated inflation to have held to the existing forecast path, and anticipated that consumer price inflation would converge to its target of 2 percent in the first half of next year.",
        "In terms of financial stability, the member expressed concern that household debt had continued to sustain a trend of substantial increase in October as well.",
        "The member went on to note that, since household debt growth may pose a risk of adjustments to housing prices after their excessive increases, future housing price adjustments could worsen household balance sheets, thus leading to an additional slump in household consumption.",
        "Accordingly, the member noted that securing housing price stability by controlling expectations of rising housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas would form the core of household debt risk management.",
        "The member then emphasized the need for close monitoring of housing market trends for the time being.",

        "In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, any changes in the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that Chinese economic growth was continuing to slow down, due mainly to the nation’s sluggish investment and declining exports, while the US economy was showing sustained recovery, boosted by growth in private consumption and housing investment, and the euro area was maintaining a modest recovery led by domestic demand.",
        "As to international financial markets, members evaluated global interest rates as having fallen overall and global stock prices as having declined substantially, affected chiefly by financial instability in China and declines in international oil prices.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that exports had remained sluggish, while the economy maintained its modest recovery led by consumption.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that stock prices had dropped significantly and the won-dollar rate had risen greatly, due to the outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds following financial instability in China and falls in international oil prices, and long-term interest rates had decreased owing chiefly to the preference for safe haven assets due to heightened financial market volatility.",
        "Most members also mentioned that bank lending to the household sector had maintained strong growth.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "As to prices, most members observed that consumer price inflation had stood at 1.3 percent, a substantial increase from the previous month, due mainly to greater increases in agricultural product prices and services fees, and that core inflation had remained unchanged from the preceding month at 2.4%.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member stated the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, attention should be paid to the direction of monetary policy in the US and other advanced countries, to global economic trends and to risks in China and other EMEs, and efforts should be strengthened to find momentum for economic improvement.",
        "The member stressed that as the global financial markets had been shaken since the very the start of the year amid a bleak global economic outlook, and as there were fewer factors supporting an optimistic view of the Korean economy than supporting a pessimistic view despite growth forecast at 3.0%, continuous efforts should be made to revitalize consumption by promoting qualitative and active communication with economic agents, and to promote facilities investment by improving the investment environment, thereby restoring growth and employment potential.",
        "The member mentioned that it was necessary to closely monitor changes in external conditions and in the in/outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds to/from the Korean market and seek measures to diversify these funds.",
        "The member also emphasized that efforts should be made to facilitate credit transactions and maintain domestic financial soundness, keeping in mind that credit differentiation and liquidity risks might emerge, and new measures to maintain financial stability needed to be developed while continuously managing the ratio of household debt to disposable income and improving the household debt structure.",
        "The member also noted that it would be necessary to analyze whether the continued instability of financial and economic conditions had been triggered by an insufficiently strong accommodative monetary policy stance, by problems in credit flows arising from financial friction, or by a low growth trap caused by structural problems, and to formulate appropriate countermeasures.",
        "With regard to the new inflation targeting regime, the member went on to stress that efforts must be made to pursue and maintain consistent and scientific explanations for price fluctuations and, if necessary, policy coordination with related authorities should be promoted and balanced expectations regarding future inflation should be fostered.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, while keeping the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, it would be advisable to closely assess the evolution of major domestic and international conditions and related risks, and to seek optimal policy responses.",
        "In support of this, the member stated that, although the downside risks to growth and inflation had substantially expanded, risks related to the Chinese economy, uncertainty related to a US policy rate hike, patterns of outflows of foreign investment funds, and patterns of changes in household and corporate debt were judged to call for cautious and elaborate policy responses.",
        "The member went on to argue that, since private consumption and corporate investment sentiment were contracting greatly due to an expansion of financial and economic instability in China and due to the North Korean nuclear test, the relevant policy authorities should devote efforts to stabilize consumption and the investment sentiment of economic agents.",
        "The member further noted that, while supplementing and strengthening measures to improve household debt both in terms of quality and quantity, care should be taken to prevent the financial crunches and funding difficulties that may materialize in the course of corporate restructuring from spreading to normal firms.",
        "The member commented that, since Korean firms in particular were under unprecedently difficult circumstances, as exemplified by sluggish exports and domestic demand and the consequent decline in operating profits, the government should pursue structural reforms to improve the economy’s fundamentals, while seeking multi-pronged policy support measures to manage an expansion of downside risks in the corporate sector as a whole and to revitalize weak growth and employment.",
        "The member went on to argue that the monetary authorities should contribute to economic revitalization in Korea through the expansion of corporate investment and employment, and actively seek and implement appropriate measures to support corporate lending for growing small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have significant spillover effects on other sectors.",
        "One other member put forward the view that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period and to adopt a flexible policy stance to respond to latent risk factors and the uncertainties surrounding the forecast path for this year.",
        "In support of this, the member stated that, first, in terms of growth, while private consumption drove the recovery in domestic demand, albeit moderately, the overall growth momentum was weakening somewhat due to the continued sluggishness of exports; second, in terms of price movements, although the consumer price forecast had been adjusted downward due mainly to sustained low oil prices, the underlying upward trend of prices was continuing, based on various supplementary indicators of core inflation; and third, although the slack in the manufacturing sector had expanded, overall labor force slack had been improving somewhat.",
        "The member noted that, to prevent a further reduction in the potential growth rate, it was necessary to identify and resolve potential insolvencies to enhance the efficiency of the capital and labor markets, to reasonably allocate the consequent losses, and to continue to carry out related market and system reforms.",
        "The member went on to express the view that economic stabilization policies - including monetary policy - should focus on a medium-term easing of temporary downside aggregate demand and inflation pressures accompanying the facilitation of structural reforms, on preventing the erosion of growth potential, and on maintaining stability in the financial system despite internal and external shock factors.",
        "Meanwhile, another member put forward the view that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the month.",
        "The member went on to note that economic outlooks by their very nature involve forecasting economic conditions by fully reflecting information available at the time of the forecast and then performing revisions using newly obtained data, and thus the preception that a revision to the economic outlook implies that there are errors in the original forecast comes from lack of understanding of the forecasting procedure.",
        "The member then presented the view that it is advisable to strengthen communication regarding the meaning of the economic outlook.",
        "The member went on to stress that, to enhance the accuracy of economic forecasting, it was necessary to increase available information, to improve the procedure for receiving feedback on errors, and to devise a procedure for increasing the accuracy of the original outlook.",
        "The member also noted that, concerning the perception of low inflation, it was necessary to examine whether consumer price inflation properly reflects the actual situation.",
        "The member then set out the view that, in consideration of the possibility that actual housing cost burdens are undervalued and of the point that the share of housing costs in the consumer price index is smaller in Korea than in other advanced countries, attention should be paid to the interpretation of the consumer price inflation, while measures to improve and supplement the housing rent index should be continually sought to limit the effects of structural changes in the housing market.",
        "One other member argued that, although the growth path was judged to have been adjusted slightly downward in comparison with the October the fourth quarter of 2015, and to downward adjustments to the rates of growth of the world economy and global trade, and the price path was judged to have been adjusted substantially downward, as a further decline in international oil prices of late had acted as a downward pressure, these downward adjustments to the paths of growth and prices were mainly attributable to unforeseen changes in external factors, and the Base Rate’s current level still seemed accommodative, even in light of the downwardly adjusted outlook.",
        "The member then argued that, accordingly, it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member also noted that remaining downside risks included the possibility of heightened international financial market volatility in line with the pace of rate hikes by the Fed and with the financial instability in China, anemic global trade, further declines in oil prices, and the weakening of growth momentum in emerging market economies.",
        "The member also expressed the view that a close watch should be kept on the question of whether the trend of improvement in domestic consumption would continue and on the intensification of the youth unemployment problem.",
        "One member stated that, first, although there were great uncertainties surrounding the domestic economy, it was forecast to show a trend of growth generally consistent with its potential growth level of 3.0~3.2%; second, although consumer price inflation was projected to fall considerably short of the 2% inflation target in 2016, it was expected to rise gradually in the second half of 2016 and converge to the target in to supply-side factors such as the decline in international oil prices, while core inflation, which shows underlying price movements, was likely to move close to 2%; and last, in view of the possibility of continued negative effects from the financial instability in China on the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets, of high credit risk aversion in the financial markets, and of the growth of household lending, particular attention should be paid to financial stability for the time being.",
        "The member then set out the view that it would be best to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, while closely examining changes in economic conditions of major countries such as the US and China, and developments in the financial and foreign exchange markets at home and abroad.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.",
        "- Based on currently available information the Bank of Korea considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued.",
        "Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by factors such as the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalization, Chinese financial market conditions, and international oil price movements.",
        "- Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand activities have sustained their paces of recovery, driven by consumption, the trend of declining exports has persisted while economic agents’ sentiments have not improved.",
        "On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of persons employed expanded in December, the employment-to-population ratio rose compared to that in December the year before while the unemployment rate fell.",
        "The Bank of Korea forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",
        "- Consumer price inflation rose from 1.0% the month before to 1.3% in December, due chiefly to increases in agricultural product prices and to a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices.",
        "Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer price inflation will fall considerably short of the 2% inflation target for the time being, owing mainly to the disappearance of the effect from the cigarette price hike and to the recent further declines in international oil prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices meanwhile registered 2.4%, the same as in November.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices slowed somewhat in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.",
        "- In the domestic financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen, influenced mostly by instabilities in the Chinese stock market and by the declines in international oil prices, while the Korean won has depreciated substantially against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen, on the effects in addition of Chinese yuan devaluation and increased geopolitical risks.",
        "Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "- Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and pay attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy or in financial and economic conditions in China, the movements of capital flows, and the trend of increase in household debt.",
        "After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that, while the US economy had maintained its economic recovery, the euro area still had not shown any signs of improvement, and the Chinese economy had maintained its moderate growth.",
        "As to international financial markets, members evaluated that major price variables, such as global interest rates and stock prices, had remained generally stable despite fluctuations owing to changes in expectations of major advanced countries’ monetary policies.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed that, although exports and facilities investment had been sluggish due to negative external conditions, the economy had continued to improve, led mainly by favorable construction investment and increased government spending.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members evaluated that major price variables had fluctuated, influenced for instance by the possibility of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and by the rise in global oil prices.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen sharply to 1.2% from the previous month’s 0.4% due mainly to increases in agricultural product prices, and that core inflation had also risen month-on-month to 1.3%.",
        "the Bank of Korea website.",
        "The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to closely monitor changes in upside and downside macroeconomic risks, housing market conditions, the trend of household debt growth, the future directions of major countries’ monetary policies, and international oil price movements, while maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that, according to the October Economic Outlook released by the Bank of Korea Research Department, real GDP is projected to increase by 2.7 percent in 2016 and by 2.8 percent in of major countries and that do not differ greatly from the Korean economy’s potential growth rate.",
        "The member, however, put forward the view that uncertainties surrounding the forecast growth path still remain high, due mainly to the delayed recovery of world trade, possible unstable movements in international oil prices, and the worsened economic sentiment associated with corporate restructuring.",
        "The member added that, according to the price inflation outlook, consumer price inflation is expected to rise gradually, influenced for instance by the dissipation of the effect of the temporary electricity fee reduction and the rise in international oil prices, to be at the mid-1% range at around the end of 2016 and to approach the 2% inflation target in the first half of 2017.",
        "The member, meanwhile, noted that, in terms of financial stability, caution should be exercised with respect to several risk factors.",
        "In particular, the member noted that apartment prices in the Seoul Metropolitan region have recently risen greatly, a pattern that was likely to spread to other regions or other housing types in view of the current housing market conditions.",
        "The member also commented that household lending is highly likely to maintain strong growth for the time being, influenced for instance by the start of the autumn moving season, buoyant sales of new apartments, and the trend of housing price increases.",
        "Finally, the member judged that, although international financial markets have recently been relatively stable, there still are factors that could lead to increased volatility in these markets, such as the future directions of major countries’ monetary policies, uncertainties related to Brexit, the possibility of European bank insolvencies, and the US presidential election.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member noted that the world economy was sustaining its moderate pace of growth, and the impacts of impending US rate hikes on the international financial markets and the foreign exchange market in Korea were likely to be limited.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member commented that although exports had remained sluggish and the restructuring of vulnerable industries had commenced, there had not been changes in macroeconomic conditions that would call for an adjustment to the Base Rate.",
        "The member, however, expressed concern that Korea’s economic growth in the upper-2 percent range, while consistent with the potential growth rate, was led by construction investment, and housing construction in particular, which was expanding at an unsustainable rate.",
        "The member also voiced concern over gradually mounting vulnerabilities related to household debt, which was increasing rapidly in line with construction growth.",
        "The member meanwhile anticipated that inflation was likely to settle near the 2 percent target next year.",
        "The member also expected that the risk of a further decline in underlying inflation, which the member judged to still run below target at the mid-1 percent range, will be somewhat controllable.",
        "Accordingly, the member expressed the need for caution in adjusting the Base Rate and emphasized that, in the interest of macroeconomic stability, there was an urgent need to encourage a soft landing for both the expansion in construction and the rapid increase in household debt.",
        "One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, as growth and consumer prices were seen to generally follow the path originally forecast and the inflation target was likely to be achieved over a medium-term horizon given expected changes in exogenous variables and movements in the GDP gap.",
        "Meanwhile, the member pointed out that it was more difficult than ever to accurately calculate potential growth and the GDP gap, as Korea, along with many other countries, was entering the era of the ‘new normal’.",
        "The member argued that domestic and overseas factors, such as the decreasing global trade volume, the declining number of high-quality manufacturing jobs, the rising savings rate and concerns about consumption contraction, would continue to affect the industrial structure of the Korean economy and propensity for consumption and cause changes in potential growth, and went on to stress that if changes occur in the outlook for growth, it would become more important to identify the exact causes behind such changes.",
        "The member stated that a small open economy like Korea should take all these matters into consideration in order to maximize the long-term effects of monetary policy on the real economy.",
        "Meanwhile, one member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that short-term growth was not expected to deviate far from the path originally forecast and that economic growth next year was forecast to be generally consistent with the pace of potential growth, with improvement in exports and facilities investment boosted by a gradual recovery of global trade more than offsetting a slowdown in construction investment and consumption.",
        "The member stated, however, that there was a relatively high degree of uncertainty surrounding the growth path.",
        "Second, with regard to inflation, the member argued that the uptrend in consumer prices had slowed owing chiefly to electricity tariff cuts and falls in the exchange rate, but the price path decline was estimated to be limited due to rising agricultural product prices and weakening downside pressures on low oil prices.",
        "Looking at various core inflation indicators, the member stated that the underlying trend of inflation had continued and that inflation would likely converge to its 2-percent target over a medium-term horizon.",
        "Third, the member argued that the slack in production had been worsening again, as the average capacity utilization rate fell significantly in line with a decline in production due to inventory adjustments and labor strikes at automakers, which more than offset the moderate growth in demand-side pressures from facilities investment in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The member mentioned that the slack in the labor force had recently been showing improvement, but the labor market had failed to improve in qualitative terms as growth in employment was seen mostly in the low-wage and services sectors.",
        "Fourth, concerning financial stability conditions, the member noted that household debt continued to grow faster than usual and that the uptrend of housing prices, which had thus far been limited to certain markets, was spreading gradually.",
        "The member added that the substantial growth in the volume of real estate-related finance was heightening the vulnerability and cyclicality of the financial system to real estate market conditions.",
        "In overall consideration of the above-mentioned real economic and inflation trends, slack in production and financial stability conditions, the member assessed that it was advisable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.",
        "Another member presented the view that, in overall consideration of the recent inflation, economic and financial stability situations, it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level.",
        "After stating that construction investment remained brisk, boosted largely by accommodative monetary policy, while exports and facilities investment remained in a slump due to negative external conditions, the member went on to forecast this year’s growth rate at near 2.7 percent, as projected by the Bank of Korea Research Department in July this year.",
        "The member noted that inflation had rebounded to 1.2 percent in September from the previous month’s 0.4 percent, affected by a rise in agricultural product prices.",
        "The member forecast that external factors such as oil prices would act as major variables for the economy and prices for the next year, and also mentioned that a recovery of exports and facilities investment would be needed to keep the growth rate at this year’s level, which would also need to be supported by a stronger global economic recovery and a restoration of the income elasticity of trade.",
        "The member forecast that if oil prices recover next year as major institutes had projected, faster growth in EMEs would lead to a gradual recovery of the global economy, and inflation in Korea would converge to its target of 2 percent.",
        "Concerning the recovery of the income elasticity of trade, however, the member’s assessment was that, given a lack of consensus among major institutes on the issue, there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the outlook for the recovery of related exports and facilities investment.",
        "In this regard, the member evaluated that, in the 2017 economic outlook presented by the Research Department, growth forecasts were exposed to higher uncertainty than inflation forecasts.",
        "Meanwhile, the member assessed household debt, a major risk factor in terms of financial stability, as maintaining strong growth in September, thereby increasing volatility in the housing market, which would lead to higher risk of greater economic volatility.",
        "The member stressed in particular that the trend in the market for new apartments was related to the direction of next year’s construction investment and growth outlooks, and that it would therefore be necessary to closely monitor future housing price trends and actual new apartment transactions.",
        "One other member expressed the view that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level at this time, and that when operating monetary policy in the future, it would be necessary to monitor the progress of the economy while paying attention to the possibility of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member stated that the economic growth rate was projected at 2.7 percent for this year and 2.8 percent for next year, but there were various downside risks ─ on the external side, the possibility of a global economic slowdown resulting from slowing Chinese growth, US Fed rate hikes and Brexit, and on the domestic side, corporate restructuring, a possible contraction of economic sentiment under the anti-graft law, and destabilization of the labor market from strikes and other factors.",
        "The member added that it should be carefully examined whether the pace of future economic growth would be as rapid as suggested in the current growth forecast.",
        "The member particularly emphasized the need to cope with risk factors while speeding up restructuring efforts, including those for industrial structural reform, and at the same time maintaining accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "In addition, noting the analysis that the uptrend in housing prices would continue for the time being and there was only a slight chance of a collapse in construction activities, the member argued that, although it was important to address household debt with macroprudential policy, recent household debt growth was restricting monetary policy and thus household debt should be thoroughly and continuously monitored.",
        "Finally, the member stressed that at the end of last year domestic and overseas financial markets had preemptively reflected the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike, and the member also emphasized that, although the dominant outlook was that the negative effects of US interest rate hikes would be limited this year compared with last year, vigilance should be maintained to prepare for the possibility of greater market volatility.",

        "However, the improvements in the euro area have remained weak.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, while being affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries such as the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries.",
        "domestic demand activities appear to have continued their improvements, driven mainly by investment in construction.",

        "The employment-to-population ratio was meanwhile slightly higher.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to a gradual recovery in global trade and to the effects of expansionary macroeconomic policies.",

        "After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery in the US was weakening somewhat, due mainly to sluggish investment and exports, and Chinese economic growth was continuing to slow down, owing primarily to the nation’s declining exports, while the euro area was maintaining its trend of modest recovery, boosted by improvement in consumption and exports.",
        "As to international financial markets, many members evaluated that Treasury rates in most major countries had fallen and global stock prices had declined substantially, affected chiefly by financial market unrest in China, concerns about the global economic slowdown and declines in international oil prices.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, members assessed that exports had remained sluggish, and the trend of improvement in domestic demand had weakened due to a decrease in consumption.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that interest rates and stock prices had dropped significantly and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, with Korea seeing outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds brought about in part by developments in international financial markets.",

        "As to prices, members observed that consumer price inflation had stood at 0.8 percent, a substantial decrease from the previous month’s 1.3%, owing chiefly to the dissipating effects of the cigarette price hike, and that core inflation also fell from the preceding month to 1.7%.",
        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Many members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlook for them both, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member noted that, although the pace of economic recovery had slowed somewhat in comparison with the January forecast, influenced for instance by the persistence of financial and economic unrest in China since the beginning of the year, and by further declines in international oil prices, and although the upward trend of prices had decelerated slightly, the current situation urgently called for securing policy space to brace for heightened uncertainties surrounding the growth and price paths.",
        "The member went on to express the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in consideration of the trend of foreign securities investment fund outflows and an increase in household debt.",
        "The member also stated the view that the creation of new demand was limited because economic sentiment was souring amid economic uncertainty despite the government’s economic stimulus policies, such as fiscal front-loading and the extension of the cut in the individual consumption tax.",
        "The member went on to argue that the employment outlook in the manufacturing sector was uncertain due to the prolonged export slump.",
        "Furthermore, taking into account that the Bank of Japan’s introduction of negative deposit rates was strongly influencing global investment sentiment, the member stated that it was necessary to closely monitor changes in the policies of major central banks and any related developments, while paying special attention to the outflows of foreign investment funds stemming in part from the decreased incentive for arbitrage trade following reduced interest rate differentials.",
        "Meanwhile, another member put forward the view that, in overall consideration of economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the month.",
        "The member noted that, although the Bank of Japan had followed in the footsteps of the European Central Bank and some euro area central banks by introducing negative interest rates to encourage loan expansion to deal with a weakening recovery, the BOJ’s move had been of limited effectiveness thus far, and there were heightened concerns about negative side effects.",
        "The member also expressed the view that there was an increasing need in Korea as well to identify and implement diverse policy instruments to respond to the heightened downside risks to growth caused by deteriorated conditions at home and abroad, and since Korea still had interest rate policy space, now seemed to be an opportune time to develop effective policy instruments, such as by providing interest rate incentives.",
        "The member went on to state that, from this perspective, the Financial Intermediation Support Facility is an effective policy tool, which can work to stimulate the economy and to ensure financial stability since it does not affect household lending and selectively provides financial support to industries in need.",
        "The member argued that, accordingly, the Bank of Korea should actively use this facility.",
        "One other member put forward the view that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, as downside macroeconomic and financial stability risks had increased and external uncertainties made it difficult to forecast the future directions of these risks.",
        "The member particularly stressed that it would be necessary to take an even closer look at changes in external conditions, in/outflows of foreign investment funds, North Korea-related risks and movements of price variables in the financial markets, while actively seeking market stabilization measures if needed.",
        "The member also argued that, in response to downside risks, it would be necessary to support exports and facilities investment through the bank intermediation support facility, and went on to state that efforts should be made to help economic agents understand well the need for careful operation of the policy rate for the time being, as in extremely unstable external conditions a central bank’s policy rate adjustment would not have the intended effects and the available policy space would be exhausted.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward by 25 basis points from the current 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent this month.",
        "The member mentioned that the future growth rate was expected to fall substantially below the original forecast, as exports had declined more than expected, improvement in domestic demand had weakened and economic agents’ expectations for economic recovery had worsened, and that consumer price inflation was also expected to fall short of the original forecast, owing chiefly to weak demand-side pressures and global oil price declines.",
        "The member also stated that due to the global economic slowdown and deflation concerns, countries such as Japan, EU countries and China had implemented or planned to implement additional monetary easing, and that the US was very likely to postpone its plan to reduce monetary easing due mainly to the delay in economic recovery and to the risk of low inflation.",
        "The member went on to stress that in the current unprecedented low interest rate environment, it might be argued that a further rate cut could incur substantial policy costs, such as an increase in foreign capital outflows and growth in household debt, but this possibility seemed to be only limited for the time being given the Korean economy’s large trade surplus and sufficient foreign reserves, and given the supervisory authorities’ recent strengthening of their control of household debt.",
        "Meanwhile, the member presented the view that the related policy authorities should be prepared to closely monitor and stabilize economic sentiment, so as to prevent economic anxiety from spreading excessively.",
        "The member also argued that the monetary authorities should actively seek out and implement more practical and varied policy measures to support the corporate sector so as to restore the Korean economy’s growth potential, and that the policy authorities needed to strengthen efforts to restructure major sectors of the national economy in order to improve economic fundamentals.",
        "Another member put forward the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the month and closely examine changes in the growth and price paths and factors causing financial instability at home and abroad in order to maintain a flexible policy stance, in overall consideration of the fact that, first, there was a growing possibility of the negative output gap widening again with the pace of growth recovery slower than originally forecast, due mainly to the worsening export slump and the waning effects of stimulus measures; second, demand-side inflationary pressures did not seem strong enough to guarantee achievement of the inflation target over a medium-term policy horizon, as the continued modest upward trend of core inflation was attributable largely to growth in prices of items insensitive to business conditions; and third, although the overall situation in the production sector had improved slightly, substantial slack remained.",
        "The member went on to stress the importance of establishing a framework for policy mixes based on thorough analyses of the current economic situation in order to ensure that future monetary policy operation would be appropriate and effective.",
        "The member also stated that, first, the degree of economic stimulus should be determined in overall consideration of how far and how fast external demand shocks from the global economic slowdown would spread to domestic demand; second, monetary policy transmission channels, including the asset price and exchange rate channels, and their effectiveness should be reexamined in consideration of the increasing decoupling of major countries’ monetary policies; third, careful preparations and contingency plans should be made in the event of possible shocks to the domestic financial markets from a financial crisis centered in EMEs, such as resource-exporting countries; and fourth, continuous attention should be paid to the trend of household debt and to the soundness of the banking system, and appropriate preparations should be made to tackle the risk of shocks in the capital market and the shadow banking sector spreading to the banking sector.",
        "One other member argued that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it might be important to pay attention to whether global financial market instability persists, as well as keep a close watch on trends of monetary and financial policies of major countries and foreign capital in/outflows, so as to minimize effects on the Korean financial markets and real economy, and the member also emphasized the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability by building economic recovery momentum and taking preemptive measures to address potential causes of financial instability.",
        "The member went on to mention that, as the global real economy had been recently swayed by financial sector instability, it would be necessary to enhance the central bank’s ability to better explain and forecast economic developments based on an accurate understanding of the relationship between the financial sector and real economy.",
        "On the domestic side, the member also stressed that, amid growing attention to whether the direction of the January forecast would remain unchanged, export support measures should be developed in light of continuously sluggish exports, and attention needed to be paid to negative asset effects that the weakening stock and housing markets might have on consumption.",
        "On the external side, meanwhile, the member put forward the view that, while paying attention to international policy cooperation, various measures to enhance the foreign exchange market should be considered, such as leading overseas investment assets back to the Korean markets, promoting the sophistication of macroprudential policy instruments, and strengthening incentives that could encourage financial institutions to keep excess foreign currencies in their reserves.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, the member stressed that efforts were required to increase supplies of long-term financial assets, to facilitate long-term credit supplies, and to seek measures to encourage foreign capital to stay in the Korean markets for the long term.",
        "As to policies, the member argued that it would be necessary to consider a comprehensive policy that seeks to stabilize the financial and foreign exchange markets, to promote stability in household and corporate sentiment and also to grow demand and enhance supply capacity.",
        "The member went on to state that efforts needed to be made to develop optimal policy mixes through simulations of various policy options.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, members compiled a statement reflecting the views of the majority.",
        "Mr. Seong Keun Ha, however, dissented, expressing his clear opposition to keeping the Base Rate at its current level, and arguing for lowering it by 0.25 of a percentage point.",

        "As to international financial markets, most members evaluated stock prices as having risen substantially, Treasury bond yields in major countries as having mostly fallen, and the US dollar as having depreciated considerably, generally due to the run-up in international oil prices, additional easing measures by major countries, and expectations of a slower pace of US policy rate hikes.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed that the trend of decline in exports had continued, but domestic demand activities such as consumption, and the sentiments of economic agents appeared to be improving somewhat.",

        "The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable this month to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "Among them, one member noted that, looking overall at changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad for the past month and the adjusted economic outlook in April, the inflation path had been partially revised downward, influenced by an additional decline in international oil prices, while the growth path had also been revised slightly downward, affected by the continued downward trend of exports and lackluster domestic demand.",
        "The member diagnosed that the downward revision of the growth path was mainly because the growth trend in the first quarter had been lower than original projection, due to mounting uncertainties about external conditions, including the financial and economic instability in China.",
        "The member went on to comment that, given that economic sentiment had improved of late and domestic demand was also showing partial signs of recovery, the domestic economy was expected to show a recovering trend, albeit modest, and the Base Rate’s current level still seemed accommodative, even in light of changes in economic and price conditions.",
        "The member then put forward the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of that the remaining downside risks included a policy rate hike by the US Fed, changes in the growth structure in China, and the possibility of Brexit, and expressed the view that attention should be paid to the possibility of increased capital flows and exchange rate volatility stemming from a sudden reversal of global preferences for risky assets.",
        "Another member set forth a number of points for the Board to consider in its operation of appropriate monetary policy.",
        "First, the slope of the future growth path was forecast to remain unchanged from its initial level.",
        "This was because, although a slight downward shift in the growth path in line with the export shock from sluggish external demand was estimated to have brought about the widening of the negative GDP gap, domestic demand was expected to show a modest recovery due to improved economic sentiment, along with the gradual easing of export sluggishness.",
        "Second, although disinflationary pressures were projected to weaken gradually with underlying upward trends of consumer price inflation and core inflation continuing and inflation expectations remaining stable, demand-side cyclical inflationary pressures still seemed insufficient to reach an appropriate inflation level.",
        "Third, slack in the production sector had not improved significantly, and although labor market slack had improved slightly, it was concentrated in relatively vulnerable sectors.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, although an overall consideration of these points could lead to the conclusion that there is a need for further Base Rate adjustments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while checking to see if the growth and inflation paths for the second quarter were consistent with the initial projections, and to strengthen the examination of changes in credit, exchange rate and other policy transmission channels and factors causing financial instability at home and abroad, thus maintaining a flexible policy stance.",
        "The member went on to note that, concerning future policy operation, the Board should effectively deal with increased volatility of capital flows and the exchange rate and cautiously monitor whether there was any change in the private-sector credit cycle.",
        "The member expressed the opinion that monetary policy should focus on the timely easing of downside aggregate demand and inflation pressures accompanying structural reforms, on preventing the erosion of growth potential stemming from expectations of low growth and the hysteresis effect, and on maintaining stability in the financial system despite internal and external shock factors.",
        "One other member presented the view that, in overall consideration of recent economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level during the intermeeting period.",
        "Meanwhile, the member mentioned that, concerning the Korean economy during the last few years, with the persistent trends of slow growth and low inflation, there were growing calls for the central bank to play a more active role, and that the so-called Korean-style quantitative easing was arousing a great deal of interest and controversy, regardless of whether this policy is reasonable or not.",
        "With regard to this, the member argued that the Bank of Korea should develop various policy measures tailored to Korean economic conditions as long as these measures do not conflict with the central bank’s own functions.",
        "The member went on to state that technical innovations in the areas of IT and payments and settlements were expected to have decisive impacts on the central bank’s roles and its implementation of monetary policy, and thus particular attention should be paid to these innovations, and the necessary support and investment should be expanded greatly.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that, in determining this month’s Base Rate, a number of factors should be considered in addition to domestic and overseas financial and economic conditions.",
        "First, although the forecasts for the growth rate and consumer price inflation for this year had been adjusted slightly downward in the recent economic outlooks, the Korean economy was expected to show a mild recovery and inflation was likely to accelerate gradually from the second quarter, and the Board should therefore continue to monitor changes in upside and downside risks to growth before deciding whether they should take a more accommodative macroeconomic policy stance to support economic recovery.",
        "Secondly, although the domestic and overseas financial markets stabilized recently, attention must be paid to the US Fed’s further rate hikes, the slowdown in Chinese economic growth, commodity price instability, increasing credit risks of European banks, the possibility of Brexit, and risks related to household loans.",
        "Finally, if Korea’s overall financial conditions are examined in terms of various indicators such as real interest rates, the liquidity growth rate and the MCI, it should be taken into account that Korea’s financial conditions remain accommodative even compared with those of major countries.",
        "In this regard, the member put forward the view that, while holding the Base Rate at its current level of 1.5 percent for the intermeeting period, it would be appropriate to closely monitor changes in domestic and overseas economic trends and the development of risk factors in the financial sector.",
        "Meanwhile, the member noted that, although Korea’s fiscal soundness is much more favorable than that of major countries, fiscal expenditure is likely to make far less contribution than before to growth, due mainly to the plan to lower the rate of growth in fiscal expenditure in this year’s budget and to the frontloading of budget spending during the first quarter of 2016.",
        "In this regard, the member went on to state that, if the situation calls for an additional easing of macroeconomic policy, such as if the growth rate falls far below its forecast path, fiscal policy should be given a more active role, with equal or higher priority than that placed on monetary policy.",
        "Another member stated the opinion that it would be advisable to cut the Base Rate this month by 25 basis points from the current 1.5 percent to to enhancing economic sentiment, improving the sluggishness of exports and domestic demand, and preventing the trend of low inflation from becoming firmly entrenched, and would also help ease the relatively high domestic interest rates due to additional financial easing policies in other countries and the relative strengthening of the Korean won.",
        "The member also argued that the US Fed is very likely to raise its policy rate in the second half of this year, which would highly likely lead to further divergence of major countries’ monetary policy stances and to even greater uncertainties and volatility in the financial and FX markets.",
        "In light of this, considering that policy transmission takes some time, active measures should be taken so that the Korean economy could restore its inherent resilience and break away from the trend of slow growth and low inflation.",
        "The member also assessed the current economic situation as calling for an appropriate expansion of fiscal spending, in addition to more accommodative monetary policy, in order to improve the weakening aggregate demand and infrastructure for growth.",
        "The member went on to argue that, along with the implementation of such counter-cyclical measures, the government should make strenuous efforts to carry out structural reforms in major areas of the Korean economy, in order to more fundamentally improve the Korean economy’s inherent resilience and fundamentals and create new engines for growth.",
        "One other member’s diagnosis of domestic and overseas financial and economic conditions since last month’s monetary policy decision was that, with regard to the financial sector, international financial market instability had eased somewhat on the impact of major countries’ easing policies, and volatility in the domestic financial markets had also decreased, but attention needed to be paid to potential risk factors, such as household and corporate debt.",
        "The member also judged that, in terms of the business cycle, global economic growth was likely to slow down and there was only weak momentum in the Korean economy moving toward a shift in economic trends, due largely to sluggish exports and uncertainties regarding whether improvements in domestic demand would continue.",
        "The member went on to state that, with the Base Rate kept at its current level of 1.5 percent during the intermeeting period, attention should be paid to the trends of major countries’ economic conditions and their monetary and financial policy trends, and also to trends of household and corporate debt and of corporate restructuring, and momentum should also be created to increase economy activity and maintain stable macroeconomic trends.",
        "In the short term, the member also called for in-depth examinations of the possibility that the recent inversion of the yield curve might have implications for future economic activities or inflation, while at the same time paying attention to uncertainties regarding US monetary policy and to the possibility of negative responses to the downward adjustment of economic outlooks.",
        "The member also pointed out that financial innovation could be of help to monetary policy by enhancing the efficiency of the financial system, but it could also complicate the environment for policy implementation.",
        "The member then emphasized that it would be important to examine if monetary policy transmission channels were changing in Korea due for example to the expansion of the market-based financial system, so as to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy, and added that it would be also important to ensure resilience of economic and financial structures, to limit any damages from negative shocks at home and abroad.",
        "The member also noted that, as the effects of the central bank’s monetary policy ultimately depended on the behavior of commercial banks that are at the center of monetary policy transmissions, it would be also important to assess the capacity of Korean commercial banks to create credit and seek measures to enhance such capacity.",
        "From a long-term perspective, meanwhile, the member presented the view that it would be necessary to develop effective indicators covering the employment situation and carry out various research, for example on the impacts of monetary policy on employment and wages, so that the central bank could help resolve employment problems with its monetary policy.",

        "As to international financial markets, members evaluated that major price variables, such as global interest rates and stock prices, had fluctuated, influenced by changes in expectations of major countries’ monetary policies, but overall they had stabilized with the continued risk appetite.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, some members assessed that the economy had continued to improve, with construction investment remaining favorable, private consumption and facilities investment rebounding after having been temporarily sluggish due mainly to the expiration of individual consumption tax cuts, and the export slump easing temporarily.",
        "With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members evaluated that stock prices had risen with the inflows of foreign stock investment funds led chiefly by the continued global risk appetite and expectations of improved performances of domestic companies, and that long-term market interest rates and the won-dollar rate had increased amid changes in expectations of another US Federal Reserve policy rate hike and then had fallen since September.",
        "As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had declined to 0.4% from the previous month’s 0.7% due mainly to the temporary discount on residential electricity rates, and that core inflation had also fallen month-on-month to 1.1%.",

        "One member pointed out a number of major considerations for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, the member stated that although growth was not generally seen to have deviated far from the path forecast in July, the current growth, dependent heavily on favorable construction investment and the real estate market, did not seem on a solid footing in terms of sustainability, and there existed a risk of the high uncertainties at home and abroad restricting future growth.",
        "Second, the member noted that, although the base effect of low oil prices had faded away, inflation in the second half of this year was likely to fall slightly below the path forecast in July, due mainly to the temporary discount on residential electricity rates and downward pressures on the won-dollar exchange rate.",
        "Third, the member argued that there had been slight improvement in the overall slack in manufacturing production, boosted chiefly by the rebound of the average capacity utilization ratio, but substantial slack remained.",
        "The member went on to state that the overall slack in the labor market had improved slightly in July, but such slack was concentrated among vulnerable groups, such as manufacturing workers and the younger generation, and attention should be paid to the possibility that factors such as corporate restructuring could undermine future improvements in the labor market.",
        "Based on an overall examination of labor market slack and the trends in inflation and the real economy, the member argued that while keeping the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to examine the spillover effects of accommodative macroeconomic policies, such as Base Rate cuts and the execution of the supplementary budget, while keeping a careful watch on developments related to domestic and overseas risk factors, including the trend of increasing household debt and the possible resumption of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "The member also stated that, with the recent decoupling of the household and corporate credit cycles, liquidity amplified by interest rate cuts was being provided mainly to sectors with low productivity, such as real estate and construction, and accordingly particular attention must be paid to the possibility of increased economic volatility and financial system concentration.",
        "Another member presented the view that a great number of corporations were in need of fundamental structural reform in line with changing global demand, and that greater investment and efforts were required to develop new industries and services sectors.",
        "The member stressed that, although various policies had been implemented to ensure long-term growth, it should be kept in mind that, unlike in the past, the current low-growth environment would last for some time, and in this regard attention should be paid to ensure that excessive short-term stimulus measures would not undermine medium- and long-term potential growth.",
        "The member also pointed out that if the accommodative policy stance continues for a long time amid persistent low growth caused by structural problems, this could lead to financial imbalances and the polarization of the financial markets, and these issues required macro- and micro-prudential and welfare policy measures.",
        "The member went on to forecast that although the Korean economy was expected to continue to show a trend of low growth, the 2% inflation target was likely to be achieved in the medium term according to the current economic outlook.",
        "The member then presented the view that, considering the conditions and outlooks for inflation and the economy, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.",
        "One other member noted that the Monetary Policy Board had thus far been maintaining an accommodative monetary policy to support the recovery of economic growth on the foundation of price stability.",
        "The member expected to see further synergy effects between fiscal and monetary policies through prompt execution of the government’s supplementary budget.",
        "The member then expressed the view that, while keeping the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, close attention should be paid to future economic conditions, the household debt trend, and external factors such as potential US policy rate hikes.",
        "Concerning future economic conditions, the member presented the view that, although growth was not seen to be deviating far from the path forecast in July, it was necessary to keep a close watch for any additional downside risks to economic activities in areas such as domestic demand and exports in the course of corporate restructuring.",
        "The member also argued that, with the huge increase in household lending persisting, it was necessary to continue monitoring and analyzing real estate market trends and the effects of measures to manage household debt which had been jointly prepared by the Board and the government.",
        "The member also commented that it was widely expected that any sudden reversal of capital flows in Korea or plunge in the won against the dollar in the event of a US policy rate hike were likely to be short-lived, but long-term Treasury bond yields in Korea and the US had been inverted of late.",
        "The member expressed the view that it was thus necessary to analyze from multiple perspectives the movements of long-term bond yields in Korea and the US and the consequent changes in capital flows that may occur if the Fed hikes its policy rate.",
        "The member noted, meanwhile, that, although the net incomes of commercial banks had risen slightly year-on-year in the first half of this year, bank management was likely to be burdened by reduced net interest margins (NIMs) from low interest rates and by increased loan loss provisions in the corporate restructuring process.",
        "The member also stressed that the Board should closely monitor the impacts of the sustained low interest rate trend on the profitability of financial institutions and on changes in their investment patterns.",
        "Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged for the intermeeting period, in overall consideration of a number of points.",
        "First, despite sluggish exports and facilities investment, the Korean economy was continuing its gradual growth, driven by construction investment, and consumer price inflation in August had run at a lower-than-expected level due to a temporary cut in electricity rates, which was a one-off factor and thus did not call for a change in the policy rate.",
        "In terms of financial stability, however, the member noted that household debt had grown at a faster pace, led by young adults in their 20s and 30s and by persons with 100 million won or more in debt.",
        "The member stressed the need for attention to a possible rise in asset prices and to the consequent possibility of excessive credit expansion stemming mostly from overheated sentiment in the new housing market and the lack of a system of risk management for collective loans issued by financial institutions.",
        "The member also presented the opinion that, given that the recent growth in debt was mainly attributable to purchases of smaller-sized housing units by young adults, and that the supply of smaller-sized apartment housing had increased greatly, attention should be paid to the possibility of an increased risk of a fall in smaller-sized apartment prices over the medium-term horizon, and to the possibility of a mounting risk that a slowdown in young-adult household consumption and a correction in construction investment could simultaneously materialize.",
        "Another member expressed the opinion that, considering the overall economic conditions at home and abroad, it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period.",
        "The member judged the world economy to be sustaining its moderate pace of growth, led by the US and China.",
        "The member also assessed that, even if further US policy rate hikes materialized, their impact on the international financial markets was likely to be limited, and thus the Korean foreign exchange market was fully capable of withstanding their impact.",
        "Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that, although export sluggishness continued, consumption indicators were not deviating far from their expected levels, and construction indicators were increasing sharply thanks to accommodative monetary and macro-prudential policies.",
        "The member assessed these current economic conditions to have both positive and negative aspects: on the positive side, they served as a buffer against shrinking aggregate demand stemming from sluggish foreign demand, but on the negative side, they gave rise to mounting concerns about the sustainability of household debt growth and expansion in the construction sector.",
        "The member, meanwhile, found no great change in underlying price movements, as the decline in consumer price inflation in August was mainly attributable to a one-off cut in electricity rates and core inflation was still running in the mid-1% range.",
        "Accordingly, the member stressed that, although there was some concern as to whether price inflation would settle near the 2% medium-term inflation target, there were also risks associated with policies aimed at promoting economic recovery and increasing inflation, which mainly rely on expansion in construction and a rapid increase in household debt.",
        "In this regard, the member expressed the need for caution in adjusting the Base Rate, taking into account developments in inflation, household debt and construction activities in a balanced manner.",
        "One other member expressed the opinion that a close eye should be kept on financial and economic conditions at home and abroad and on changes in a number of risk factors, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent.",
        "The member noted that, taking into overall consideration domestic and overseas economic conditions, although there were great uncertainties, the domestic economy was expected to continue to show a trend of moderate growth generally consistent with its existing forecast path.",
        "Meanwhile, the member emphasized that, although the implementation of the Measures for the Management of Household Debt announced in August was expected to gradually curb the pace of household lending growth, it was necessary to continually keep a close watch on the trend of household lending given the existence of factors fueling an increase in lending demand, such as a buoyant Seoul metropolitan housing market.",
        "The member added that attention should be paid to the possibility of an unexpected expansion of volatility with respect to financial market price variables and capital flows, as going forward the policy stances of major country central banks including the US Fed, the Bank of Japan and the ECB could diverge, and market expectations on their policy stances could change.",
        "Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all the members.",
        "leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period.",
        "the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth.",
        "However, the improvements in the euro area have remained weak.",
        "The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, while being affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries such as the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries.",
        "the effects of transitory factors, and domestic demand activities appear to have continued their improvements while the sentiments of economic agents have improved somewhat.",
        "On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in July of last year.",
        "The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.",
        "in August, owing chiefly to the effect of a temporary cut in electricity fees.",
        "Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.1%, from 1.6% in July.",
        "In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued.",
        "Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise due to the disappearance of the effect of the temporary electricity fee reduction and the weakening influence of the low oil prices.",
        "risen as foreigners’ stock investment funds have recorded net inflows in line with continued risk-taking tendencies globally.",
        "Long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar and Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rates have fallen, after having previously risen, affected mainly by changes in the expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans.",
        "ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.",
        "In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring."
