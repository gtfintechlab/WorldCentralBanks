The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent for the intermeeting period.
The member, meanwhile, presented the opinion that there had been ongoing concerns about a possible domestic economic downturn, as a global economic slowdown had been underway, led by industries upon which Korean exports heavily rely on.
Meanwhile, some members emphasized that, although prices were relatively stable, the real estate market was in a recession and the uncertainties surrounding domestic and overseas financial markets were increasing.
Based on all of this, the member argued that the growth and price paths did not have solid footing and their uncertainties were extremely high, but considering that this had already been expected during the last month’s rate cut, it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
In addition, the member pointed out that there had been a slight slowing of price inflation with respect to items sensitive to economic conditions and of core inflation with items whose prices are administered excluded, and this implied a slight weakening of demand-side inflationary pressures and was also consistent with the recent real economic path.
Many members mentioned that, in the international financial markets, with global interest rates showing stable trends due to the easing of concerns about early QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices had risen sharply.
However, members expressed conflicting opinions on the background to this growth.
On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in July of last year.
The member went on to argue that the policy authorities should work hard to improve economic sentiment by conveying their policy intentions more clearly and by ensuring that they are equipped with various policy instruments and are prepared to implement them.
Mortgage lending has continued to increase on a relatively large scale, even though house transactions have been inactive.
The amount of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has moderated in all parts of the country.
The member noted that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path had heightened further, as there were factors making for political and economic instability at home and abroad, and as the economy was expected to slow down in the fourth quarter, influenced for instance by discontinued production of some items, corporate restructuring and the anti-graft law.
In addition, the member assessed that we can’t afford to be complacent, as developments in global energy prices related to China’s reopening and the rise in public utility bills could work as restraints on the downward stabilization of consumer price inflation.
The member’s assessment of the domestic economy since the end of last year was that demand in the private sector had stagnated and weak growth dependent on expansion in public sector expenditure was continuing.
The member also stated that financial stability risks related to real estate PF loans still existed.
He then presented the view that the normalization of interest rates should be considered at an appropriate time, when the economic recovery had become evident.
Meanwhile, one member took the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in overall consideration of factors such as household debt that cause financial instability and the heightened uncertainties concerning domestic and overseas conditions, despite a slight increase in downside risks to the recent real economy and next year’s inflation.
The member also noted that there was a growing possibility that with the prolongation of the pandemic the temporary liquidity shortage stemming from the loss of sales could gradually transform into a solvency issue.
The member assessed that the domestic economy had maintained growth consistent with the potential growth rate in the first half of this year, but the gap between exports and domestic demand had been widening and uncertainty surrounding the future growth path had increased somewhat.
The member pointed out that, first, lending to households by non-bank financial institutions had been rising sharply, led by mutual credit firms, and second, optimism that the housing market would stabilize could be premature, since slower construction investment had not materialized, contrary to expectations.
In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.
Members also noted that, while the international financial markets had generally shown stable movements, global interest rates had declined, stock prices had risen, and global capital had shown inflows to emerging market countries.
He added that, as the Base Rate was being cut in parallel with the easing of the LTV and DTI regulations to normalize the housing market, it would be advisable to closely monitor the real estate market in the future, and to make the required preparations for implementing macroprudential measures if needed.
The member stated that after the SVB incident, risk aversion sentiment had been strengthened globally and that there were also expectations of an easing of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening stance.
As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative policy stance while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends.
Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise due to the disappearance of the effect of the temporary electricity fee reduction and the weakening influence of the low oil prices.
The member argued, however, that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high, owing to geopolitical risks as well as the lack of agreements in trade talks between major countries.
The member noted that financial stability indicators were positive, with government bond yields and lending rates falling and with money markets generally being assessed as stable.
The member emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the sudden concentration in the asset markets of liquidity that had increased as a result of the aggressive monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 shock.
The member’s assessment was that, although the accommodative fiscal policy had been acting as a buffer against the real neutral interest rate decline, this would have only a limited effect, considering the sluggish income and inflation indicators.
The member mentioned that economic shocks from COVID-19 had lasted for the third consecutive year, due to the spread of the Omicron variant.
The member also noted that the Board should decide when to make an additional adjustment to monetary accommodation, while reviewing the transmission effects of the Base Rate hikes, the developments and impacts of the pandemic, and growth and inflation conditions, while carefully monitoring improvements in financial imbalances at the same time.
Members expected CPI to fall somewhat going forward, given recent underlying inflation and the decline in oil prices, and fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1 percent range, not deviating greatly from its target.
Looking at the recent changes in domestic and external conditions, the member assessed downside risks to the growth and price paths as having increased somewhat from the April forecast.
The member added that households’ mortgage interest rates were already running above the pre-pandemic level in reflection of the government’s lending regulation measures, and policy measures to offset the negative side effects of low interest rates, such as debt service ratio (DSR) rules differentiated by borrower, had also taken effect.
Another member opined that there was a need to even out the maturity distribution of household debt, since there was a possibility of a vicious circle being set in motion between souring household loans, particularly those extended to older age groups, and real estate market instability.
Finally, the member pointed out that financial imbalances were continuing to accumulate amid the accommodative financial conditions.
More specifically, there is a higher likelihood of housing sale prices becoming more sensitive to lending rates, as household liquidity holdings have increased and recent housing transactions have been mostly driven by non-speculative demand.
The member added that, since the Base Rate had been raised on two occasions in August and November last year, it would be necessary to examine the effects of these rate hikes.
The member noted that employment conditions had improved somewhat with the number of persons employed increasing slightly in October.
despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product prices as the decline in petroleum product prices accelerated.
In addition, the member commented that the restructuring of troubled companies, which had become an issue of late, and difficulties in monetary policy in the course of such restructuring exemplified the importance of curbing moral hazard by taking preemptive policy measures to strengthen financial soundness.
Long-term market interest rates have fallen back after having previously risen, in reflection mainly of interest rate movements in major countries.
The member thus saw the need to take active policy measures to deal with this issue.
However, one member pointed out the possibility that the degree of contribution of fiscal stimulus to growth might fall greatly from the second half of the year, since it would be difficult for the government to expand its spending significantly this year due to concerns about fiscal soundness.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members took the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 1.25% from its current level of 1.00%, while one member argued that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 1.00%.
the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but economic activities in the euro area to have been unable to shake off their sluggishness, while emerging market countries have shown continuing economic growth.
The member stressed that it would be necessary to address the uncertainties felt by economic agents and stop self-reinforcing dynamic adaptation, while sharing the view that it was difficult to expect the domestic economy to grow at more than a modest pace in a situation where exports were unlikely to recover easily.
Taking these points into overall consideration, the member saw it desirable to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.5% at this meeting.
The member forecast that the global economy would maintain strong growth exceeding its potential this year and global trade would sustain strong growth for the time being, and assessed the weakening of real economic indicators in some advanced countries during the first quarter as having been attributable to one-off factors.
The member noted that the world economy was sustaining its moderate recovery, and there had recently been signs of reflation.
The member also expressed the opinion that, in discussions about ending or changing the various financial support measures which had been adopted so far, consideration should be given to the differences in recovery trends by industry, sector, and income class.
The member particularly noted that typical domestic demand areas, such as the wholesale & retail trade and food & accommodation industries, were continuing to show sluggishness since the second half of last year.
The member thus saw that the short-term shock to the domestic economy could be much greater than past incidents of infectious diseases.
The member added that now is the time for us to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% and to monitor the effects of the high interest rate policy that we have kept so far.
With respect to employment, many members evaluated the employment situation as continuing to improve, with the gradual increase in number of persons employed, particularly in the private sector.
Members expressed concerns that, on top of the slowdown of domestic demand, the sluggishness of exports that had become apparent since the second quarter might limit domestic economic growth.
The member commented that, although exports had been continuing to show a solid recovery, factors such as the deterioration in trade conditions with China had been working to increase the negative impacts on both goods and services exports, thus requiring ongoing monitoring of trade with China on an item-by-item basis.
The member thus added that there would be a need to support the real economy and stabilize inflation expectations by implementing an accommodative monetary policy for some time.
The member also expressed the view that the government and the supervisory authorities should also carry out macroeconomic and housing policies for stabilization of household debt and the housing market in a consistent manner.
The member also expected construction investment to show improvement in the second half of this year.
The member added that we had gained clear insight into how substantial fiscal expenditures, which had inevitably heightened during COVID, had impacted inflation.
The member forecast that, however, a somewhat different picture could be in sight from the previous quarter in that exports would decline at a much faster pace, particularly to the US and the euro area where preventive measures had been strengthened, while the decline in private consumption would ease gradually, boosted by various policy support measures.
As to the domestic economy, many members noted that growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 had not been strong, due mainly to contractions in consumption and construction investment.
Concerning the domestic financial markets members noted that, with the inflows of securities investment funds of foreigners continuing, interest rates had fallen, stock prices had risen, and the Korean won had appreciated.
The member added that the slowdown of the consumption recovery was not expected to continue past the middle of the fourth quarter, since vaccines had been proven to be effective in preventing severe cases, and the domestic vaccination rollout had gathered pace of late.
Concerning inflation, the member noted that the growth in service charges had been accelerating, coupled with upward pressures on the supply side.
The member forecast that core goods inflation would slow, as a decline in import prices would be reflected after a time gap, and upward pressure on core service inflation would weaken further, influenced by a sluggish housing market and households’ increased debt servicing burdens in line with rate hikes.
The member added that there were high uncertainties as to how the COVID-19 situation would develop and how severe its impacts would be.
The member also expressed the view that, since the COVID-19 shock had been asymmetric, fiscal support and bank intermediated lending support, which allow selective support for vulnerable groups, should be continued.
However, due to high interest rates and inflation, consumer and investment capacity has weakened, exacerbating the imbalance between domestic demand and exports, and sectoral differentiation in the labor market is also happening.
A different member suggested the view that uncertainties associated with loan-to-deposit regulations might increase, as substantial changes were expected to take place in banks' fund-raising and fund operation.
The member added that concerns about the spread of the Irael-Hamas conflict had been somewhat mitigated, leading to falls in global oil prices.
Looking at the changes in domestic and external conditions since the previous MPB meeting, the member assessed the recovery of the global economy as strengthening gradually, boosted by expansion of vaccine distribution and reopening the economy as well as the economic stimulus in major countries.
The member then stressed the necessity of looking into the third option, which is to boost the housing rental market.
Going forward as well, many members expected the domestic economy to remain on an upward track, led by exports.
The member, however, emphasized that housing supply policies, tax policies and macroprudential policies should be carried out as planned in order to stabilize the housing market.
The member, however, pointed out that the price path had not been showing a commensurate change.
Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.
some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have shown improvements, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish.
The member went on to forecast that although the Korean economy was expected to continue to show a trend of low growth, the 2% inflation target was likely to be achieved in the medium term according to the current economic outlook.
Stock prices have risen, with the large scale inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds.
Meanwhile, the member commented that China was at a stage of possible deflation, as inflation fell amid the slowing economy.
Regarding the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country slowed.
Improvement in the growth rate, in particular, is a factor adding to demand side inflation pressures, and, in this regard, its impact on disinflation needs to be closely monitored.
Meanwhile, the member mentioned that the spread of global risk-off sentiment had increased financial market volatility significantly, and the policy implications of the rising won-dollar exchange rate could be examined from various perspectives.
In summary, the member saw that, while the growth trend has improved, risks from external conditions, such as the exchange rate, remain, and upside risks to inflation have increased.
The member added that this was attributable to the softened expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s further rate hikes and adjustments in the pace of long-term bond issuance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and thanks to a weakened U.S. dollar.
The member commented that, for the moment, no major central banks were attempting to change the monetary policy stance to reflect the overconcentration of funds into asset markets.
The member presented the view that, therefore, it was appropriate to respond first by adopting microprudential policy.
Another member meanwhile expressed concerns about the continued, albeit slight, rise in mortgage loans under the influence of low lending rates.
The member’s assessment was that the recent decline in Korea’s potential growth was attributable to sluggish global manufacturing production and the decline in global trade volume.
Looking at the financial markets, the member took the view that, as the US was expected to continue its rate hikes, and trade conflicts among major countries and financial conditions in EMEs had been working to destabilize the financial markets, it would be necessary to continuously monitor the possibility of a spread of related risks.
One member emphasized that exit strategies including raising of policy rates were already being implemented in some emerging market countries, prompted by concerns about inflation and rising asset prices.
However, there is a heightened need for caution regarding the potential increase in volatility in foreign exchange markets, and the accumulation of financial imbalances, including rising housing prices and household debt.
Reflecting the outcome of these discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was prepared and then unanimously approved by the members.
Looking at price conditions, the member mentioned that, since the flattening of the Phillips curve, which implied a weaker linkage between growth and prices, had been witnessed across the world of late, Korea also was unlikely to see a large increase in underlying demand-side inflationary pressures.
Considering the inflation outlook, the member expected that the real Base Rate would exceed the neutral rate of interest after the second quarter, constraining private consumption even further.
The member saw that the global economy was maintaining growth above its potential and continuing to show a modest expansionary phase.
The member assessed that, since the record high interest rate differential between Korea and the U.S. could destabilize exchange rates and expand volatility in the foreign exchange market, it would be important to keep a close eye on foreign exchange movements and prevent any rise in foreign exchange volatility.
The main details of the MPC members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Although the sluggishness in domestic demand and exports were expected to last while inflation continued to run at a low level, members decided unanimously to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, sharing the view that there was a need to keep an eye on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad for a while longer, since domestic and overseas financial market instability had eased somewhat of late and major countries were taking policy measures to boost their economies.
Meanwhile, the member presented the view that consumer price inflation remained at a low level of around 1 percent year-on-year and, although economic participation and employment rates were recently rising, this was attributable to the gradual expansion in labor market capacity in line with the rising rate of employment of the over-50s offsetting the declining rate of youth employment, and this was unlikely to lead to upward pressures on inflation over a medium-term horizon.
The trend of economic growth was generally not expected to deviate far from the path forecast last July.
The Committee forecasts that, due largely to the stability of international agricultural prices, inflation will remain low for the time being, but that it will be higher than its current level.
One member argued that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, it would be necessary to more closely analyze the trends of global risks and uncertainties that had recently grown more pronounced, while priority should at the same time be placed on examining the effects on the Korean economy of the Base Rate cuts in August and October.
One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 2.50% from the current 2.25% at this meeting.
One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current 0.50%.
Concerning future price conditions, he indicated that it was too soon to relax due to the numerous uncertainties, such as international oil prices and unstable agricultural product prices.
The member assessed that the gap between financial and real economic conditions was not narrowing, since the real economy was showing a very modest recovery while asset prices and credit to the private sector maintained strong growth.
The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s QE tapering.
One member presented the view in addition that attention should be paid to the facts that the share in overall bank lending of loans to SMEs had been decreasing since the financial crisis and, furthermore, that the share of credit-based loans in total bank lending to SMEs had also continued to decline.
The member expressed the view that this had also been witnessed during the period of economic downturn around 2012 and seemed to be related with population aging, a structural factor of the Korean economy.
increase in the prices of petroleum products and the base effect from the decline in the prices of public services last year.
With regard to inflation, the member’s assessment was, although that the Research Department had raised its inflation forecast for this year significantly to 3.1% and also adjusted its core inflation forecast upward to 2.6%, upside risks were even greater considering the recent global oil price trend and inflation pressures.
After briefings by staff on ‘Current Economic Developments in Korea’, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that Chinese economic growth was continuing to slow down, with the nation’s exports declining, while the US economy was maintaining its recovery, with consumption, facilities investment and the housing market continuing to improve and employment growth accelerating, and the euro area was showing a modest recovery.
The member saw these changes as positive, but pointed out that, since the US-China trade negotiations had not yet been finalized and global manufacturing and investment still remained sluggish, it was necessary to constantly keep an eye on the relevant developments.
- Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major countries’ monetary policies and geopolitical risk in Eastern Europe, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth.
The member commented that the global economy has been growing moderately overall due to monetary policy tightening, with the U.S. sustaining growth far exceeding initial expectations.
As for the global financial markets, members judged that volatility of price variables, such as interest rates in major countries, had increased temporarily but then stabilized with risk-off sentiment easing in accordance chiefly with a reduction in major country policy uncertainties.
However, the member evaluated that, given that there were concerns about downside risks to growth and private debt repayment burdens of the vulnerable groups in particular had increased, it would be desirable to reduce the degree of Base Rate increase to 25 basis points this time.
Looking at an adjusted projection by the Research Department, the member expected that the growth gap would turn negative, while the inflation gap would remain in positive territory.
In other words, the member was of the view that low demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from the continuation of the negative output gap had been leading to the widening of the negative inflation gap.
The member mentioned that it would be necessary to clearly communicate whether the focus of diagnosis of, and prescription for, economic conditions would be placed upon a return to the potential growth rate, upon adaptation to the new normal, or upon responding to a new crisis.
Regarding the domestic economy, the member noted that growth was exhibiting a gradual recovery trend, boosted by favorable semiconductor and automobile exports, while domestic demand, such as private consumption and investment, had continued to show a weak recovery.
Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to remain weak, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates.
The member expected consumer price inflation to far exceed the path projected in February, as impacts of rises in commodity prices and global supply disruptions, the two factors working to increase prices since the second half of last year, had grown since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis.
In line with this, he argued that the possibility of a hard landing of the Chinese economy should be closely monitored.
The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environment and the future outlooks for both, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.
The won-dollar exchange rate decreased due to the weakening of the dollar.
The member thus noted that, at this juncture, it was necessary to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while giving more attention to financial stability in monetary policy operations.
The member presented the view that, fortunately, the labor market maintained a strong recovery trend despite these conditions.
Meanwhile, the member assessed that the accumulation of financial imbalances had been easing, as the government’s various regulatory policy measures had led to slower growth in real estate-related lending and a trend of decline in housing prices.
Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen while the currencies of emerging economies have depreciated, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries.
The member argued that production growth led by exports and the manufacturing sector had started to lead to a recovery in domestic demand and that there were significant changes in indicators which called for consideration of whether the future path of monetary policy should be adjusted.
The member noted that, since the middle of last year, rising import prices including commodity prices had been gradually leading to rising prices of final consumer goods through producer prices, and the number of items showing price increases in the Consumer Price Index had also been growing.
The member, however, stressed that the financial markets could be destabilized greatly in line with the developments in the spread of COVID-19, and therefore external soundness conditions and potential risk factors at home and abroad should be closely examined and prepared against.
Members also mentioned that there had been growing concerns in the global financial markets, as Asian emerging market countries had seen declining stock prices and depreciating currencies and had experienced foreign capital outflows in consequence of the US-China trade dispute.
Meanwhile, members pointed out that, although international financial markets remained stable overall despite external potential risks, attention should be paid to the possibility of greater volatility.
The member thus emphasized the need to pay attention to this issue.
The member also added that, on the fiscal side, the Bank should actively set forth its views to ensure that the expansion of the fiscal burden would dynamically lead to a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution, while creating a favorable environment for fiscal expansion through low interest rates and purchases of Treasury bonds.
Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose from 2.1% to 2.3%.
Another member commented that, while lowering the Base Rate by weakening consumer and investor sentiments, it was necessary to pay attention to ensure that factors threatening financial stability, such as an increase in household debt and a delay in corporate restructuring, did not materialize, and to closely examine the effects of changes in global financial market conditions resulting from any shift in the US monetary policy stance.
The member also raised concerns about a growing possibility that spillover effects from negative shocks, such as an economic recession or housing price declines, could expand due to heightened vulnerabilities to household income and housing price risks.
One member opined that attention should be paid to the fact that adverse effects from the persistence of low interest rates for an extended period were already appearing, in the form of a deepening of economic imbalances—with real interest rates currently remaining negative and household and corporate lending growth accelerating—and that the Base Rate hikes should consequently be resumed, once the global financial market unrest had eased to some extent and positive signs of changes in economic activity had reemerged.
As for the world economy, with concerns persisting about its slowdown, uncertainties lingered due largely to the delays in recovery of consumer and investor sentiment.
The member expressed the opinion that, overall, monetary policy should maintain its current accommodative stance, prioritizing improvements in macro indicators such as growth, inflation and employment, in response to the wider-than-expected spread of COVID-19 and domestic and international economic sluggishness.
The member also noted that some non-bank financial institutions that had significantly increased their exposure to real estate financing were experiencing a rapid increase in delinquency rates, suggesting that there were potential risks related to the real estate market.
The members projected the growth rate for this year and next year at 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, as forecast in January this year.
The member went on to state that the overall slack in the labor market had improved slightly in July, but such slack was concentrated among vulnerable groups, such as manufacturing workers and the younger generation, and attention should be paid to the possibility that factors such as corporate restructuring could undermine future improvements in the labor market.
The member thus called for closer attention on this matter.
The member presented the view that, since GDP for this year would be only 3% higher than its pre-COVID-19 level recorded in 2019 and private consumption was likely to return to its pre-COVID-19 level in the second half of next year at the earliest, it would be necessary to wait a little longer to see whether GDP growth led primarily by exports and the manufacturing sector would lead to expansions in household income, wages, employment and consumption.
Moving forward, the domestic economy is expected to show a moderate growth trend as robust export momentum continues and as sluggishness in domestic demand gradually eases due to slowing inflation and improving household real income conditions.
The member stated that lending growth associated with sales of new apartments and housing sales was stabilizing.
The member stated that the GDP growth forecast for this year had been adjusted downward to 2.7% from 3.0% and consumer price inflation was expected to remain at around 5% for the next several months to run at approximately 4.5% for the year overall, well above the previous forecast of 3.1%.
Members also judged that risk aversion in the international financial markets had heightened, and that the U.S. dollar had continued to strengthen.
The member went on to express the opinion that, given these factors, while the Base Rate should be maintained at the current level, it was necessary to closely monitor downside risks to the macroeconomy going forward.
economy has weakened due to the resurgence of COVID-19.
The member mentioned that inflation expectations of the general public had been growing recently along with the continued uptrend in prices, and went on to state that in order to prevent this from imposing an additional burden on the future path of the domestic economy and also on monetary policy options, preemptive measures needed to be taken for stable management of inflation expectations.
The member noted that, amid sluggish demand from major trading partners for goods imports, exports had remained sluggish affected by a slowdown in the global semiconductor industry.
First, looking at the global economy, the member assessed that, while the growth trend had differentiated across major economies and as inflation had continued to moderate in its underlying trend, uncertainty had increased overall due to a prolongation of tightening monetary policy stances in advanced countries and heightened geopolitical risks.
The member expected the GDP growth rate for this year to be generally consistent with the August projection since negative external risks, such as global supply disruptions, global inflation, and a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, were predicted to be offset by the possibility of an expansion in domestic demand following a transition in the disease control system in the fourth quarter.
On the other hand, the member assessed that core inflation in the U.S. had not declined greatly from the level seen in the second half of last year, and that it was rising in the euro area.
Meanwhile, the member stated that, in the FX market, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, which had risen significantly, fell sharply, in line with improvement in investor sentiment, driven by expectations of an adjustment to the pace of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
In terms of inflation, members noted that consumer price inflation had risen to the lower-5% level during January, driven by an increase in processed food prices and hikes in public utility fees.
On the global economic front, the member noted that global trade was showing a solid recovery despite existing risks such as uncertainties originating in China, slow recoveries in other emerging market economies, rising energy prices, and supply and demand imbalances.
Meanwhile, the member presented the opinion that, as loan delinquency rates for real estate project financing and at non-bank financial institutions continued to rise, it would be necessary to examine risks more closely, keeping in mind the possibilities of deterioration in asset quality of related financial institutions, as well as of the weakening of their financial intermediary functions.
As inflation slows in accordance with the forecast path, there are growing expectations that inflation will converge on its target level in the second half of next year.
In global financial markets, the rise in stock prices in major countries has moderated as risk-taking tendencies were offset by factors such as inflation concerns.
Another member voiced the opinion that efforts to normalize Base Rate must be driven forward persistently, since the opportunity to curb price rises with monetary policy was receding and the negative effects including household debt expansion and delays in corporate restructuring were gradually increasing with the pause in rate normalization.
The member expressed concerns that financial imbalances had been worsening, as the continued risk-taking tendencies and yield-seeking behavior of economic agents had caused household debt to build up and asset prices to rise significantly.
The member projected that the domestic economic growth would remain at a lower level than initially expected, affected mainly by the global economic slowdown and the worsening of financial conditions at home and abroad.
Looking at the overseas economic environments since the previous MPB meeting, the member judged that global inflation had been strengthened, and recovery in major economies had weakened, due to the war in Ukraine and prolonged lockdowns in China.
Long-term market interest rates have declined, and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen slightly.
Therefore, the member argued that the Bank should actively consult with the government to ensure that fiscal policy could be operated in a more expansionary manner.
Looking at employment, which had been recently recovering somewhat, the member noted that employment in the services sector was anticipated to improve, while that in the manufacturing sector was forecast to remain lackluster for the time being, and careful monitoring was required in this regard.
As for Korea, however, the member’s evaluation was that there were only slight inflationary pressures at the moment.
In this regard, the member expressed concerns that the fall in service charges, which was closely related with the livelihood of economic agents, could act as a larger shock causing inflation expectations to decline.
economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy.
rates fell and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar, as price variables fluctuated in line largely with international financial market conditions and economic indicators in major countries.
Looking at the FX and financial sectors, the member took the view that, despite a rise in interest rates due to expectations of monetary policy normalization at home and abroad, the situations in the FX and financial markets were not cause for major concern in terms of conditions for external borrowing, foreign currency liquidity management, and corporate funding.
Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have further decreased.
Members also noted that, although the household lending growth was slowing somewhat, it was still high compared to past years, and thus a close watch should be kept on the accumulation of financial imbalances.
The member assessed that the decline in core inflation had been slower than expected due to the continued pass-through of accumulated cost pressures into prices and the sustained upward momentum of service prices.
The member then expressed the view that, although an overall consideration of these points could lead to the conclusion that there is a need for further Base Rate adjustments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, while checking to see if the growth and inflation paths for the second quarter were consistent with the initial projections, and to strengthen the examination of changes in credit, exchange rate and other policy transmission channels and factors causing financial instability at home and abroad, thus maintaining a flexible policy stance.
The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period as, with inflation remaining at a low level, the domestic economy was maintaining its steady trend of recovery.
The member also pointed out that leaseholders of commercial real estate had been increasing, particularly among small business owners, and in light of this, if business conditions slowed in the future, it might cause related loans to turn sour.
The member also expressed the view that, despite heightened international financial market volatility, financial instability seemed unlikely to spread to Korea, thanks largely to Korea’s sustained current account surplus and to sound financial conditions at Korean financial institutions.
In other words, the real GDP growth rate was holding steady as net export growth stemming from lower import volume had offset a decline in the contribution of domestic demand to growth, resulting in the slowdown of GNI and nominal income growth.
The member stated that it would be desirable to adjust the pace of tightening, while looking at the future domestic price and growth paths, capital flow trends, global financial market conditions, and changes in monetary policy in major countries.
One member took the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting, as the downside risks to the real economic growth path had expanded somewhat of late, acceleration in price inflation was still modest, and the downside risks to the growth path for next year had increased slightly.
- Based on currently available information the Board considers that the US economy has emerged from its temporary slowdown and shown a trend of moderate growth.
The member took the view that most economic indicators had been shifting to a downward trend and China’s economic slowdown could worsen in the course of trade conflicts and debt restructuring, which made it difficult to take an optimistic view of future economic conditions.
The member commented that there were heavier depreciation pressures on the won and greater incentives for an increase in external debt, as residents’ direct and indirect overseas investment had been expanding and foreigners’ domestic portfolio investment was continuing to show a net outflow with the current account surplus narrowing sharply entering this year.
Another member pointed out that with the delayed recoveries of the U.S. and other advanced economies, a hike in global oil prices and household loan defaults might have a negative effect on the domestic economic recovery.
The member saw that, with respect to global trade, goods trade was sustaining high growth, while recovery in service trade had been delayed.
The member also projected that consumption would sustain its underlying trend of improvement, since the effects of the spread of the virus variants were unlikely to last long considering the full-scale vaccinations of young and senior age groups and previous measures to combat COVID-19, and the government was implementing policy measures to support income and boost consumption.
The member judged that, although there had been ups and downs in the monthly data, from a broader perspective exports had remained favorable and consumption had maintained steady growth, despite significant corrections in investment, and the growth rate had generally remained close to its potential level.
The member stated that numerous emergency measures had expired so far, but supporting the credit market through an SPV that purchases corporate bonds and commercial paper, and the expansion of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, were still ongoing.
The member noted that, at this time, the Research Department’s April forecast looked to have significant downside risks, and even if the forecast materialized, it was still difficult to see the Base Rate of 1.50% as low relative to economic fundamentals.
The member, meanwhile, forecast that as global financial market conditions were expected to remain accommodative with a diminishing likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve further tightening, countries would likely show increasingly diverging policy stances from now on depending on their own economic conditions.
However, the member stressed the need to operate monetary policy cautiously, while examining the effects of the rate hikes so far, major economic indicators and future developments in terms of financial unrest, as financial stability risks also appeared to have increased both domestically and internationally.
In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while carefully monitoring developments in the US-China trade negotiations, the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks and examining their effects on domestic macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.
Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to run in the 3% range for a considerable time, exceeding the path projected in November, and above the mid-2% level for the year overall.
The member stated that spillover effects of changes in non-core inflation on core inflation could persist for some time due to remaining pressure of increasing costs so far, regardless of demand-side pressure.
One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at the current The member evaluated that, looking at global economic conditions, trends of economic growth in major countries excluding the US had slowed, and world trade had also remained sluggish.
Specifically, the U.S. economy is showing a growth trajectory surpassing expectations, as consumption remains strong and as the labor market demonstrates robust performance, potentially resulting in a slower-than-expected inflation deceleration due to demand-side pressures.
Concerning the price outlook as well, members anticipated that, although the CPI growth rate might slow somewhat on the back of government's micro-level efforts, upward pressures would remain high due mainly to increased inflation expectations.
The member added that facilities investment was showing faster-than-expected growth, while the correction in construction investment was proceeding at a modest pace and therefore was unlikely to constrain macroeconomic recovery.
One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to closely monitor changes in upside and downside macroeconomic risks, housing market conditions, the trend of household debt growth, the future directions of major countries’ monetary policies, and international oil price movements, while maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period.
All members shared the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% level for the intermeeting period.
The member expected that, despite a slight increase in the Base Rate in the current environment, growth and prices would remain on their forecast paths, and the Base Rate adjustment would help achieve financial stability by easing risk appetites and thereby curbing leveraged investment, mitigating the inefficient distribution of resources and curbing capital outflows.
However, some members expressed concerns about the additional increase in banks' household lending, while another mentioned the possibility of growing default risks, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with poor credit ratings, influenced by the worsening of fund-raising conditions for construction companies, due to the delayed real estate market recovery and tighter attitudes toward SME lending following the supervisory authorities' strengthening of soundness supervision.
Second, the member’s assessment was that, while the growth gap was narrowing, macroeconomic policy would expand further overall this year given the government’s fiscal policy stance, even if the Base Rate remained at the current level.
The member, however, commented that the causes of low inflation had not yet been resolved.
With this view in mind, most members agreed that the current economic recovery was not yet solid enough to allow an immediate shift in the policy stance.
As a result, the output gap was estimated to have become less negative.
has continued but domestic demand activities such as consumption, and the sentiments of economic agents appear to be improving somewhat.
The member went on to note that the decision in November 2015 to include the yuan in the SDR currency basket was a consequence of the Chinese government’s phase-in implementation of its medium-to-long-term plan to make the yuan an international currency.
August, owing mainly to slowdowns in the rates of agricultural product price increase and to declines in petroleum product prices.
However, the member expected the Board to reduce the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate, while monitoring domestic and overseas economic developments and financial stability conditions, if the current forecast continued to hold that there would be a pattern of high price growth in the first half and low growth in the latter half and core inflation excluding electricity and gas fees would decline to the 2% range after the second half.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members evaluated that the volatility of major price variables, including interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, had increased, as also seen in the international financial markets, and that long-term market interest rates had risen substantially, affected chiefly by expectations of a US policy rate hike and rises in major country Treasury bond yields, while stock prices had fallen due to the increased uncertainties at home and abroad.
The member saw that inflation would remain very low this year, due to low demand-side inflationary pressures amid the combined interactions of structural and cyclical factors.
- The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period.
The member saw that, while global trade had begun to recover modestly from its slowdown, many countries were still exhibiting weak growth.
The member meanwhile stated that international financial market volatility had partially expanded in line with rate hikes in the US and the escalating trade dispute between the US and China.
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments,[2)]_ _FX and International_ Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members’ evaluation was that the domestic economy would show growth generally consistent with the previous forecast.
Nonetheless, the member noted that upward pressure on wages was declining and labor productivity, which had rebounded temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic, was slowing again as employment grew, especially in the low-wage sectors, following recoveries in the hotel & restaurant and health & welfare sectors, as well as growth in the elderly and female participation rates in economic activity.
As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have come to a halt, while the steep upward trend in the rest of the country has continued.
Members, however, added that there was a need to pay attention to changes in export and employment conditions in line for instance with stronger protectionism by the US and a foreign automaker’s decision to shut down a factory in Korea, while bearing in mind that employment was growing, led by export manufacturing industries, and employment growth was slowing in the service industries closely associated with domestic demand.
Looking at sectors, the member saw that, concerning private consumption, consumption of face-to-face services had been sluggish due mainly to containment measures, and overseas spending was unlikely to reverse course for a considerable time.
Even though construction investment has continued to be subdued and facilities investment has decreased, exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has steadily increased.
The member noted, however, that entering this year, the expectations for policy rate cuts had somewhat weakened in major countries, partially reversing developments in those indicators.
The member also forecast the output gap to remain positive, even if slightly, with exports continuing to grow, consumption maintaining the trend of improvement, facilities investment undergoing a modest adjustment from its high level, and construction investment continuing to go through a correction as expected.
The member added that, more fundamentally, there had been a continued underlying trend of changes to global value chains.
The member expected the domestic economy to sustain growth consistent with the path forecast in August, led by continued strong exports and solid growth in investment as well as a gradual recovery in consumption.
The member commented that the reduced uncertainty about major country policies had been easing global financial conditions via the retreat of risk aversion, which in turn could work in favor of policy flexibility of the countries where external conditions were not considered sound.
In terms of inflation, the member noted that, with the consumer price uptrend slowing in the first quarter, the future trajectory of annual inflation had been adjusted slightly downward.
On the other hand, one other member put forward his view that it would be advisable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75% for the intermeeting period.
The member’s assessment was that monetary policy still remained accommodative, in view of abundant market liquidity conditions.
One member commented that the possibility of a double-dip recession in the US economy, the sovereign debt problems in certain European countries and geopolitical risks on the Korean peninsula had served as factors limiting normalization of the Base Rate, but that uncertainties with regard to these factors seemed to have eased significantly of late.
The member’s assessment was that, in the financial markets at home and abroad, volatility in price variables had heightened due to concerns about the spread of global trade disputes.
The member commented that household lending was showing stability this year, acting a backdrop to seamless corporate funding despite worsened corporate bond issuance conditions following the recent rises in bond yields.
The member, however, stated the need for paying further attention to downside risks to the macroeconomy overall.
The member noted that, with respect to private consumption growth, it had shifted to a trend of recovery from a prolonged downturn in the second half of last year and had exceeded GDP growth year-on-year until the first half of this year, but the savings ratio in the household sector still remained high, and thus it was uncertain whether the growth could be maintained.
However, the member presented the opinion that, since the domestic and overseas policy environments remained fluid and macro indicators had become more volatile, it was necessary to take a little more time to monitor the relevant indicators to see if the recent developments would lead to meaningful recovery or would be mere one-off events.
Prior to the members’ discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, the government representative.
The member added that growing uncertainties over the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in the second half of this year would likely increase volatility in financial and foreign exchange markets.
In the housing market the uptrend of sales prices has slowed, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposit prices have continued to rise at a pace similar to that in October.
The member also mentioned that the diffusion index has not been falling since July, while that of core items has been continuously climbing.
The member thus expressed the need to carefully monitor the situation in vulnerable sectors.
Labor market conditions have continued to be favorable with a low unemployment rate, despite a slowing increase in the number of persons employed.
The main details of the MPB Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
The member took the view that, in overall consideration of growth, price and financial conditions of the Korean economy, it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate hike stance to respond to underlying sources of inflationary pressures, while taking microeconomic stabilizing measures to deal with market unrest.
Looking at specific sectors, members expected exports and facilities investment to maintain their trends of improvement and the sluggishness in private consumption to ease gradually.
However, the member pointed out that consumer price inflation had risen significantly, reaching the mid- to upper 3% range of late, surpassing initial projections, driven by sharp increases in oil and agricultural product prices.
The member however emphasized that it would be necessary to choose appropriately among interest rate-focused monetary policy instruments in response to inflation and among market stabilization measures in pursuit of financial stability that would be fit for the situation and purpose.
The member noted that, even if consumer price inflation for this year rose to around 2%, as projected by the Research Department, consumer price inflation for 2019 and 2020 was only 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, and core inflation would remain at the pressures was not a matter of concern, and inflation expectations implied in long-term interest rates were not high.
Meanwhile, one other member asserted that, although the possibility of debt deflation occurring as suggested recently in some circles was evaluated as not high, the household debt- and real estate-related issues—factors to which the Korean economy was structurally vulnerable— posed the risk of escalation to ignite a crisis at any time, and so measures to resolve them must be sought with continued interest in the future.
The member commented that, amid the ongoing slowdown in the global economy, exports had not been showing any sign of recovery, and it had become more difficult to expect a recovery in exports in the immediate future, due to recently growing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade dispute.
Finally, the member found it difficult to be optimistic that the trend of household debt growth would stabilize next year, since demand for home mortgage lending was expected to be strong, led by apartments under construction that had already been sold, despite policy efforts to curb household debt.
The member, however, emphasized that a close watch should be kept on the impacts of the recently introduced anti-graft law and the government measures to stabilize the housing market.
In this regard, in the current situation in which demand-side inflation pressures were weak but sustained, it would be desirable to adjust incentives for savings and investment toward the level of the neutral interest rate to curb financial imbalances, and since this would coincide with an increase in fiscal expenditure for the vulnerable, it would not cause any significant changes in aggregate demand-pull pressures.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that stock prices had dropped significantly and the won-dollar rate had risen greatly, due to the outflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds following financial instability in China and falls in international oil prices, and long-term interest rates had decreased owing chiefly to the preference for safe haven assets due to heightened financial market volatility.
Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.
In conclusion, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.75 percent at this meeting and keep an eye on future developments, and went on to argue that it would be desirable to carefully decide whether to further adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation after comprehensively evaluating economic growth and inflation trends as well as changes in financial stability risks, based on economic indicators.
The member also pointed out that there was excessive liquidity in the financial markets, as seen in the real Base Rate falling short of the neutral interest rate and a surge in the money supply relative to its long-term trend.
The member noted that, although household lending growth was slowing, the household lending to income ratio still remained high.
The member diagnosed that, given recent economic conditions, growth for this year could run below 2% and it was difficult to be optimistic about economic recovery for next year.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows.
After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained and the economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing, while economic growth in some emerging market countries continued to deteriorate affected mainly by export sluggishness and capital outflows.
- Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.
The member analyzed that this weak domestic demand was a key driver of disinflation in Korea, as it makes it difficult to pass on accumulated cost pressures to the second round, even in the face of supply shocks, such as the surge in agricultural prices since the second half of last year.
The member added that delinquency rates of some non-bank financial institutions, which had significantly increased their exposure to real estate financing, had also continued to increase sharply.
One member pointed out that, even if the Base Rate was maintained at its current level for December, a clear signal should be conveyed to the markets that the central bank's stance on interest rate normalization to achieve price stability remained in effect.
Members saw that, with respect to prices, consumer price inflation for this year would run above the path projected in May, due not only to upward inflationary pressures on the supply side but to gradually increased pressures on the demand side as well.
Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to slow gradually, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates.
The member noted that global trade had remained sluggish, probably due to the fact that the global economic recovery since last year had been driven primarily by the services sector, and went on to state that global oil prices had risen, boosted by the extension of production cuts by OPEC+.
The member judged that, given the current inflation situation and the strong recovery of the real economy, however, it would be desirable to respond to underlying inflation pressure that had become more pronounced.
Looking at the real economy, the member’s assessment was that the slowdown in global trade growth had become a trend while exports and facilities investment had become more lackluster, and as a result, an economic slowdown had become apparent, with the growth rate far below the potential growth rate.
The member added that it would be necessary to consider conducting monetary policy with a greater focus on financial stability once the spread of COVID-19 eases and the domestic economy shows a marked recovery.
Accordingly, the member pointed out the need to keep a careful watch on developments such as political uncertainties in the US, and risks related to North Korea’s nuclear tests.
The member added that in doing so it would be important to continue closely monitoring changes in financial stability risks.
The member added that the MERS clusters were basically no more than an incidental and temporary shock that might affect the growth rate but neither the trend of economic activity nor the growth path; it would be a hasty move to respond by way of interest rates.
As for recent domestic economic developments, most members' assessment was that the domestic economy remained on a steady upward path, led by stronger exports and improved domestic demand.
Meanwhile, the member expressed the view that continued coordination with other policies would be needed to minimize potential policy costs incident to the Base Rate cut.
Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated considerably in line mainly with concerns about spreading trade protectionism and with the decline in risks related to North Korea.
With these taken into account, the member mentioned that the growth rate was highly likely to be lower than the May forecast.
The member took the view that the sluggishness in the global economy could ease somewhat toward the second half of the year, boosted by the normalization of China’s economic activity and improvements in the IT industry, but that it would not be easy to expect any rapid economic recovery due to the spillover effects of the short-term surge in interest rates on the financial sector and the real economy.
One other member also put forward the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and added that there was a need to closely examine whether the channels of transmission of the August Base Rate cut were functioning properly.
The member thus asked that attention be paid to financial stability risks.
The member added that, given that there was also little sign of improvement in employment in the domestic demand-led services industry, the projection that ‘consumer price inflation will approach its 2-percent target in the second half of this year, dependent upon economic recovery’ also seemed somewhat uncertain.
By sector, members forecast private consumption to remain sluggish, affected mainly by a strengthening of social-distancing measures, and exports to exhibit a more modest recovery than originally expected due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in major countries and a delay in the recovery of the semiconductor industry.
However, the member assessed that financial conditions were still very accommodative given high growth in monetary aggregates and leverage was still increasing.
Volatility in global financial markets has increased sharply.
The member took the view that, if the current monetary easing stance continues, its negative side effects on the economy as a whole could be larger than its effect of supporting vulnerable groups, and in this regard, it would be necessary to use fiscal and financial support measures ensuring selective resource allocation for these groups.
The member noted, however, that a sharp correction in housing prices amid rising delinquencies in loans to the real estate sector could lead to an increase in credit risks and to financial market instability.
The member noted that, with major global institutions and investment banks adjusting their world economic growth outlooks for this year sharply downward, the real economy and financial markets in Korea would be inevitably hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The member noted that, on top of the preemptive Base Rate cut, if the government pushes ahead with its announced 10-trillion-won supplementary budget, Korea is expected to cope effectively with the contractions in consumer and investor confidence stemming from corporate restructuring.
In this regard, the member stated the view that there was an urgent need to collect micro-data related to household debt in order to gain an understanding of the exact state of household debt in Korea, including lending to self-employed business operators and the debt of unregistered landlords, and to set up a system of managing such data systemically.
The member however mentioned that, since a rise in interest rates was highly likely to increase interest repayment burdens on vulnerable groups at a time when there remained high uncertainties related to COVID-19, it would be necessary to strengthen coordination with other policies such as fiscal policy and the Bank Intermediated Suppor t Facility.
The member added that aggressive financial support was also needed for businesses and vulnerable groups experiencing a temporary crisis triggered by an unexpected shock.
economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.
In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices slowed somewhat in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.
The member noted that private consumption had remained strong, boosted by improvement in services sector consumption, and forecast that private consumption was unlikely to shrink rapidly in the second half as well, supported by employment growth and wage increases.
The member noted that consumer price inflation declined to 4.2% in March.
Concerning the direction of economic policy for the following year, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that the government planned to pursue four major policy objectives: achieving macroeconomic stability and improving the fabric of the economy; revitalizing the economies of ordinary people and enhancing the quality of their lives; strengthening the base for domestic demand and developing new engines for growth; and enhancing Korea's national profile while reinforcing its international cooperation.
Fourth, with regard to financial stability conditions, short-term and long-term market rates and corporate bond spreads showed stable movements, while foreign portfolio investment inflows continued with the sustained risk appetite in the international financial markets.
Another member noted that, in view of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of the Korean economy, such as the excessive household debt level and low corporate profitability, as a precaution against further expansions of financial unrest in emerging market countries there was a need to thoroughly prepare measures in advance for responding to any sudden reversal of foreign capital flows.
In the U.S., the member noted that the consumption slowdown had continued moderately, and that economic growth had slowed at a lower-than-expected pace.
December, as the effects of the slowing in the downward trend of petroleum product prices and of the expansion in the extent of decline of agricultural product prices offset each other.
The member evaluated the growth divide as having become more serious and employment conditions as having worsened further of late, as recovery in the real economy was led by some export industries, such as IT, and shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic had been concentrated in the low-value-added services industries.
With respect to the domestic economy, the member judged that there were growing concerns about a weakening of growth momentum, as exports had been sluggish, affected largely by a slowdown in the growth of the global economy and trade and also in the global semiconductor industry.
the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued, but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have persisted.
The member also added that the pace of recovery in private consumption has been slowing due to an aggravating burden for households to make principal and interest repayments, while inflation appears to have been slowing, as well.
The member added that, by sector, government income growth was estimated to greatly exceed 3 percent, while that in the corporate sector was significantly lower than 3 percent.
The member observed that household loans in the financial sector rose at a rapid pace, driven by the increase in apartment prices and transaction volume in Seoul and its surrounding areas.
The member’s further argument was that attention should be paid to the suggestion by some that, if the US economy improved, boosted for example by the Biden administration’s fiscal policy, and inflation pressure increased, the Federal Reserve might change its monetary policy stance sooner than expected.
Meanwhile, some members raised concerns about the possibility of low inflation affecting inflation expectations.
In the meantime, the member presented the view that the ensuing difficulties faced by vulnerable sectors should be addressed with appropriate microeconomic policy measures through concerted policy efforts.
Members evaluated that, in this regard, the US Federal Reserve and major central banks had strengthened their accommodative monetary policy stances.
The member assessed that the global economy had continued to exhibit a moderate recovery, crude oil and other commodity prices had rebounded, and asset prices had shown an upward trend in advanced countries, which had helped Korea’s exports shift to an increase and acted as a factor supporting a rebound in manufacturing production and facilities investment in related industries.
Members, however, pointed out that a closer look at the details of employment showed that the degree of improvement in overall employment conditions remained insufficient.
Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the delay in recovery of the global economy.
The member expected core inflation to continue a gradual slowing trend going forward, but uncertainty remained regarding the pace of slowing due, for instance, to secondary spillover effects resulting from accumulated cost pressures and the possibility of hikes in public utility charges.
As to prices, the 1st Vice Minister disclosed that the government saw prices as the most essential element for stability in the lives of ordinary people, and was consequently concentrating its efforts to contain concerns over price instability, by monitoring prices and improving its response systems, while focusing on early stabilization of the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products including vegetables.
In this regard, the member expected the overall economy to remain lackluster for the time being, even when accounting for the government’s active fiscal policy.
The member then assessed this as strongly attributable to employment growth in the health & welfare sector, led by the government’s job creation policy, and in the construction sector, associated with an increase in the availability of apartments.
The member noted that the consumer price inflation forecast for next year had been revised upward to over level for next year, following similar figures this year.
The member expected consumer prices for this year and next to be generally consistent with the October forecasts.
The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe.
Concerning financial imbalances, the member expressed the opinion that there was a need for close monitoring of the possibility of a recovery of profit-seeking demand in the housing market, and of whether unproductive demand for funds was increasing in the commercial real estate market.
Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of low oil prices.
Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at the 2% level, and for the year as a whole slightly exceed the January projection (1.8%).
He went on to note that the stability of inflation expectations had eroded due to the coexistence of conflicting market expectations as to the direction of monetary policy operation given the growing contradictions between the price stability and the financial stability targets in line with the persistent low inflation and the sharp increase in household debt.
Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the directions of the US government's economic policies.
The member noted that inflation remained low in reflection of these domestic and international conditions, and price indices showing demand-side pressures remained flat in the upper-1% range.
The member evaluated that Korean economic growth had slowed since the second quarter to show a 0.6% quarter-on-quarter increase and annualized growth at the mid-2 percent level, and explained that the growth was dependent upon semiconductor exports and fiscal expenditure and thus seemed somewhat unstable, while employment in the private sector had been highly lackluster.
The member added that, if the Base Rate were lowered at this meeting, there would be only limited scope for further downward adjustments to the Base Rate, not only in terms of financial imbalances, but also in terms of policy effectiveness and possible capital outflows, although this judgment could of course vary depending upon changes in domestic and international financial conditions and the monetary policy operations of major economies.
Another member expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as domestic economic conditions had not changed much from the previous month and the international financial markets had shown stability in the short term.
Long-term market interest rates have increased, in reflection of the changes in interest rates in major countries.
The member explained that this was because the export slump had gradually been easing, and, on the domestic demand side, the effects of the accommodative monetary and fiscal policy measures taken so far were expected to continually rein in the negative impacts of COVID-19 and drive a recovery in demand from households and corporations.
The member thus noted that it was desirable to first utilize macroprudential policy to address these issues selectively.
The extent of growth in bank household lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in household lending by non-banks has been sustained.
The member’s assessment was that, although Korea’s economic growth had been driven by facilities investment related to IT sector exports and by construction investment associated with household debt, the economic recovery had so far not been transmitted fully to household income.
He added that the channels for revival of the Korean economic growth potential and for returning to the appropriate price level needed to be examined closely, while also strengthening the macroprudential supervisory framework through cooperation among the related authorities with regard to financial stability risks including the increase in household debt.
The member stated that government bond yields fell sharply due mainly to the sharp decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields, and short-term market interest rates also declined significantly.
Accordingly, the member expressed the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged at the current 3.50% at this meeting.
Members saw that, although household lending growth had been slowing, attention should be paid to the continued strong growth in sole proprietor loans.
The Board judges that the additional high and is projected to be above the target level for a considerable time, although the domestic economic growth rate is expected to be below the November forecast.
The member also assessed domestic economic activities to have shown improvement, as the sluggishness in private consumption had eased somewhat and exports and facilities investment had increased.
The member presented the view that while deleveraging may be painful, it does ensure an economy’s soundness and sustainable economic growth in the long-term.
The member noted that, in general, economic growth and prices in the second half of this year would likely be consistent with their July forecasts, but various upside and downside risks had been growing of late.
He went on to argue that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period since, due mainly to seasonal factors, there was not enough data to judge the strength of the economic recovery, and there was also a need to further observe the effects of the government’s front-loading of its budget implementation and of the BOK’s Base Rate cuts.
Members saw that, going forward, downside risks to prices would increase further, due to a plunge in international oil prices and the effects from the government’s measures to stabilize people’s livelihoods.
One member, while noting that there still was a possibility of international financial market volatility heightening with monetary policies in major advanced countries diverging, expressed the opinion that it would be better to keep a close watch on the monetary policy implementation by major advanced countries and the movements of international financial market price variables going forward, while closely monitoring their influence on the domestic economy.
The member thus judged them to be positive changes.
The member assessed that, considering these points, the domestic economy did not appear to have emerged greatly from its overall sluggishness, despite its partial and moderate recovery.
Overall growth in the U.S. is favorable, although there are signs of a slowdown in consumption, and the eurozone economy is recovering, led by consumption, amid political instability.
One other member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.
With regard to financial stability, the member’s evaluation was that some changes were witnessed to the previous year’s trend of household debt growth being led by leasehold deposit loans and credit loans extended by banks.
The member expected that the effects of the widening of interest rate differentials caused by further tightening in major economies on the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate would be limited.
The member assessed that, although consumer price inflation had risen significantly in January, inflation in 2017 was unlikely to deviate far from the January forecast of 1.8 percent, and went on to argue that, based on the forecast that supply-side inflation pressures would not be large, it would be possible to maintain accommodative monetary policy in consideration of downside pressures to the economy.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
One member pointed out that, if the growth momentum in major advanced economies weakened, a very critical touchstone in determining future economic trend would be whether the emerging market countries could successfully lead the global economy instead.
The member observed that global economic growth had fallen short of its long-term average, affected by global monetary tightening, but that growth had been uneven across countries.
The member also anticipated that facilities investment and fiscal expenditures would make a greater contribution to growth compared to this year, boosted by growth in semiconductor investment demand and a rise in tax revenue.
English on the Bank of Korea’s website.
Furthermore, the member expressed the view that, since the FX sector could remain highly volatile and work to destabilize financial markets for some time due to changes in expectations of major country monetary policies, external soundness should be a matter of policy concern as well.
As to leasehold deposit prices, the scale of their increase widened somewhat in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while their uptrend in the rest of the country exhibited a pace similar to that in the preceding month.
Another member meanwhile argued that the possibility of global economic recovery was also gradually increasing, thanks to the signs of improvement in U.S. employment and housing indexes, which had until then been a source of deep concern.
The member judged the uncertainty of the economic outlook to have heightened further as the unexpected US presidential election result had cast uncertainty on whether the world trade volume would recover, although the growth pattern of recoveries in exports and facilities investment serving as a buffer against slower construction investment was expected for 2017.
The member pointed out, however, that the faster growth in private consumption had not yet been seen to facilitate production in domestic demand-oriented industries represented by services industry and to improve employment in related labor markets.
The member noted that in consideration of these changes in domestic and international conditions, the Research Department had revised downward the growth forecasts for this year and the next to the upper-2% range and the mid-2% range, respectively, and revised upward the inflation forecasts to 4.5% and 2.9%, and these directions appeared to be appropriate overall.
They also noted that long-term interest rates had fallen, affected by stronger preferences for safe assets.
The member saw that market interest rates, as well as deposit and lending rates in the banking sector, had fallen to historic lows; growth in private-sector credit and market liquidity had sharply accelerated; and stock prices had recovered to the level seen before the COVID-19 outbreak.
The member added that this expectation was supported by large spillover effect on inflation, and in business cycle-sensitive price indexes, which reflect demand pressures; and (ii) the fact that the rate of inflation expected by the general public had held steady in the mid-2 percent range.
The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the euro area fiscal crisis and to the fiscal consolidation issue in the US.
The member thus expressed the opinion that the government should provide guarantees for solvency risks in advance to allow the central bank to preemptively respond.
However, the member expressed the opinion that high inflationary pressures would persist longer than expected, due not only to supply disruptions, but also to rapid recovery in demand, and changes in the labor supply and demand structure.
The member forecast that if oil prices recover next year as major institutes had projected, faster growth in EMEs would lead to a gradual recovery of the global economy, and inflation in Korea would converge to its target of 2 percent.
In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while closely examining any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions.
The member noted that the process of resolving accumulated financial imbalances could weigh on growth in the short term, but this would lay a foundation to further consolidate Korea’s economic fundamentals over the medium-term horizon.
After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that, while the moderate economic recovery in the US had been sustained, the economic sluggishness in the euro area showed signs of easing and the modest recovery in Japan had been maintained, bolstered by an expansion in domestic demand, economic growth in some emerging market countries had slowed, influenced in part by financial instability.
The member evaluated that the weakening of demand-side pressures was attributable to a decline in the potential growth rate to the mid-2% range or lower.
The member added that even if downside risks associated with the Ukraine crisis, slower growth in China and policy rate hikes in major economies materialized, growth would be unlikely to run below the potential level, at least in the short term.
The member noted that, in reflection of such sluggish domestic demand, inflation was declining as well.
After briefings by staff on ‘Recent Economic Developments’, ‘FX and International Finance’ and ‘Financial Market Trends’, the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the US economy had shown robust growth with its employment indicators improving, that although markets had quickly steadied after the Brexit shock, the trend of recovery in the euro area had weakened due mainly to sluggish exports, and that the Chinese economy had maintained its growth, led by consumption.
The member went on to express the view that it would be desirable to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, in consideration of the trend of foreign securities investment fund outflows and an increase in household debt.
Lastly, one other member put forward the opinion that it would be advisable to carefully monitor the progress of overseas risk factors and monetary policy operations of major advanced countries, and to closely examine their effects on domestic business activities, prices and financial market conditions.
One member noted that, as the downside risks to the growth path were becoming ever more prominent at this time, financial and economic developments at home and abroad must be scrutinized while proceeding with policy adjustment at a measured pace.
The member meanwhile forecast consumer price inflation to remain high at around 6%.
He then argued that the Base Rate should be adjusted slightly downward from its current level, on the judgement that a succession of policy rate cuts would be more effective as a preemptive policy response.
Meanwhile, one member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to adjust the Base Rate downward by 25 basis points from the current 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent this month.
Another member, on the other hand, expressed the view that it was desirable to keep the accommodative monetary policy stance in place for the time being, given that prices were currently relatively stable, the real estate market was depressed, and the uncertainties surrounding the domestic and foreign economies were deepening.
After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: Concerning the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery in the US had been sustained, and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appeared to be easing, with major sentiment indicators continually improving.
The member took the view that, considering the need to preemptively adjust monetary policy in a situation where heightened North Korea risk had not produced any noticeable shocks on the real economy, this seemed the right time to adjust the degree of monetary easing.
The member presented the opinion that, although the Bank of Korea Research Department had revised the economic outlook downward in reflection of those points, there could be additional downside risks due to high uncertainties.
The member first pointed out that there were growing uncertainties as to whether the trend of rapid growth in the world economy would continue in the future as well.
The member, meanwhile, saw that employment was very sluggish, particularly in the face-to-face services industries, influenced by the spread of COVID-19, and expected the sluggishness to continue for the time being.
Meanwhile, the member noted that inflation was generally following the movement of the expected path.
The member noted that, since last monetary policy decision meeting, inflation had remained in the mid-0% range and some indicators of inflation expectations had been responding to this.
Taking into consideration these domestic and overseas economic conditions, the member saw a need to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current level of 3.50% this time and to monitor progress in the real economy and inflation relative to the projected paths for some time, while checking that both consumer and core inflation declined sufficiently in-line with their forecast paths.
The member expected that fiscal policy would contribute considerably to economic recovery, due to a large year-on-year increase in the managed fiscal deficit.
Meanwhile, the member added that sustained high rates of growth in various liquidity indicators including M2 implied that financial conditions were still very accommodative.
Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 4% range for some time, and run substantially above the February forecast of 3.1% for the year overall.
The member stated that entering this year, private consumption had shown signs of recovery on the back of pent-up demand, but that consumption regarding outside activities, such as food, accommodation, and travel, was sluggish due to the longer-than-usual rainy season and in particular considerable precipitation in May and July.
Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, as inflation was not seen to have deviated greatly from the original forecast path and was expected to converge to near the inflation target over the medium-term horizon, despite growing uncertainties surrounding real economic conditions and exogenous variables.
In this regard, the member considered it appropriate to monitor future macroeconomic developments while holding the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period.
Most members evaluated the recent domestic economy as sustaining its solid upward path, led by strong export growth and the steady increase in domestic demand.
The member, however, expected it to pick up from the second half onward, given recent movements of prices of oil and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and planned hikes to public utility fees.
In terms of inflation, meanwhile, the member noted that consumer price inflation had slowed to the mid-1-percent range in the fourth quarter last year, due mainly to slowed growth in agricultural and livestock product prices and a fall in city gas bills, and added that, despite real economic growth, the wage growth rate and other labor market indicators had not yet exhibited signs of inflation pressures building up in line with improvement in the output gap.
On the employment front, the number of persons employed has shown a trend of increase above its average pre-global financial crisis level, led by the higher age groups.
Concerning labor market conditions, the member noted that the number of persons employed was maintaining its substantial uptrend, and household income conditions were improving thanks to a solid upward trend in wages.
The member, however, pointed out that the scale of household debt growth had been expanding since the second half of last year, as real estate prices in some regions continued to rise substantially.
The member took the view that, since policy uncertainties concerning exchange rate instability could distort economic agents’ decision-making regarding consumption and investment and cause herd behavior, various efforts should be made to stabilize the financial and FX markets.
Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that the adjustments in facilities and construction investment had continued, exports had seen a greater decline, and employment conditions in the private sector had continued to be sluggish.
In this regard, the member judged that the possibility of a real-financial vicious circle, in which financial market unrest adds to the real economic shock, had been prevented to some extent.
One of these members assessed that, with downside risks to the global economy increasing, the domestic economy now faced heightened risks of slow growth and slow price rises owing to the contraction of domestic demand and exports.
The member thus emphasized the need to continue policy efforts to ease the risks of an accumulation of financial imbalances.
The member mentioned that, although facilities investment had somewhat slowed, exports had sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand.
Many members shared the view that domestic demand including private consumption and investment was showing gradual improvement.
Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that some real indicators were showing mixed signals, just like those in the US, with private consumption remaining relatively strong, the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowing, and manufacturing production, service production and exports showing sluggishness.
The member, however, assessed this to be largely attributable not to demand factors but to policy factors, which include the government’s welfare policy measures, such as an increase in public heath care benefit coverage, an expansion of free school meals, and temporary cuts in the individual consumption tax and electricity fees.
One member noted that now was the moment when providing some momentum for the restoration of confidence was necessary, since the pace of economic recovery was judged to be still unsatisfactory and the economic slowdown had become prolonged, due particularly to a massive weakening in confidence of economic agents, while prices were seen likely to sustain a low rate of increase below the inflation target for the time being.
The member saw that, in the U.S., the economy exhibited strong growth thanks to robust consumption and employment conditions, and that inflation was falling slowly, prompting a longer duration of the Federal Reserve's tightening policy stance than initially expected.
Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) recorded a negative rate, and the inflation expectations of the general public have moved down slightly within the upper-1% range.
The member also stated the view that the creation of new demand was limited because economic sentiment was souring amid economic uncertainty despite the government’s economic stimulus policies, such as fiscal front-loading and the extension of the cut in the individual consumption tax.
Going forward, the member stated that it is necessary to closely monitor the inflation and growth trajectories in the conduct of monetary policy.
In determining the monetary policy direction in these macroeconomic conditions, the member took notice of the following matters.
He reasoned, firstly, that although the GDP growth forecasts for 2015 had been revised downward, this was attributable to an extremely lackluster second-quarter performance due mainly to one-off factors and that the Board had expected it and responded preemptively by cutting the Base Rate in June.
Going into more detail, the member first stated that although there were high uncertainties in domestic and overseas economic conditions, the domestic economy was expected to continually hold to the January forecast path.
Next, the member assessed that Korea’s fiscal position was relatively sound compared to those of other advanced economies.
Another member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at the current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period, it would be best to keep a careful watch on changes in risks to the macroeconomy and financial stability.
However, further monitoring is required to determine whether such buoyancy of domestic demand, including private consumption, will continue.
Some members mentioned that, despite slowed growth in household lending due to rate hikes and stronger regulations, corporate lending had been showing strong growth, and it would be therefore necessary to pay attention to financial imbalances stemming from increased leverage in the private sector.
The future path of inflation is likely to be influenced by international oil prices and exchange rate movements, agricultural product price trends, and whether public utility fees are adjusted.
Meanwhile, some members expressed the view that, although inflation had recently slowed somewhat and some inflation indicators, such as weighted median core inflation and short-term inflation expectations, had been improving, there still were high uncertainties including possible economic slowdowns at home and abroad and a buildup of upward pressures on public utility fees.
Regarding the future outlook, members anticipated that it would not be difficult for the domestic economy to remain on an upward track, as export conditions were likely to improve further, affected by the improvement of the US economy, and domestic demand conditions including employment, wages and stock prices were expected to be favorable.
The member expected household debt growth to remain stable overall, although the volume of household debt growth could increase somewhat in the second half of this year compared to the first half.
Household and corporate lending has been growing at a faster rate, driven by lower lending rates and by the provision of policy funding, but further monitoring is required as to whether this trend continues into the future.
On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued to rise significantly year-on-year, although the unemployment rate has also risen as job search activities have increased.
Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 2.3% to 2.2%.
The member went on to stress that continued vigilance and policy preparations were required in this regard.
The member pointed out that, on the external front, there was a low possibility of financial instability in EMEs spreading to Korea in consideration of its favorable external soundness, but the possibility of continued monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve causing instability in Korea’s capital flows and domestic financial market price variables could not be ruled out.
With respect to financial imbalances, the member emphasized the inefficient allocation of resources stemming from population aging, and pointed out that, while for major OECD countries, the average household net savings rate had remained in the 6-percent range and household debt-to-disposable income ratio at the 140-percent level during 2012-2016, the household net savings rate in Korea had risen by 5.4 percentage points, from ratio had increased by 20 percentage points, from 150 percent to 170 percent during the same period.
the Base Rate cut and the economic policies of the government including the supplementary budget, strive to improve the sentiments of economic agents and lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth.
The member also stated that, with the recent inflation pressures attributable largely to supply-side factors, producer prices were rising faster than consumer prices.
Some members stressed that it would be necessary to remain on the alert against the possibility of uncertainties such as geopolitical risks and prolonged global supply constraints having a negative impact on the future domestic economic recovery.
With regard to employment, the member stated that growth in the number of persons employed had been slowing at a modest pace and that the pace of growth in basic wages had been slowing slightly.
Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the amount of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened substantially in December.
The member’s assessment was that the consequent overall sluggishness of consumption had kept core inflation within the mid-0% range, and that given the recent household income conditions, employment conditions and demographic factors, major changes were unlikely to be seen in the trends of private consumption and inflation.
The member expressed concerns that, after having improved slightly since October, face-to-face services industries might shrink again in line with the recent continuous growth in the number of domestic confirmed cases and the strengthening of social distancing measures.
The member also noted that there were signs of possible adjustments in household debt and the real estate market, influenced for instance by strong macroprudential policy.
As for household debt, the member stated that as the decline in household debt has continued since last year, the leverage that had been excessive has seemingly begun undergoing corrections.
have weakened more than originally anticipated, with the rates of growth in exports and domestic demand remaining at low levels.
Exports have continued to show solid growth on the back of the recovery in the IT industry and are forecast to improve steadily.
The 1st Vice Minister commented that the domestic economy was likely to maintain its robust movements for the time being, against a background of sustained buoyancy of domestic demand and exports and increased private sector employment.
The member meanwhile noted that the business climate for SMEs had not shown substantial improvement.
The member expected this sluggishness to ease into the second half of the year.
The member argued that, given that the current monetary policy tightening stance had begun in order to deal with a buildup in financial imbalances and inflation, it would be premature to let our guard down now.
However, the won-dollar exchange rate is unlikely to experience sudden fluctuations, as the U.S. dollar remains strong amid ample global dollar liquidity.
The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to run above the target level for a considerable time.
The member pointed out that the decline in the value of customs-cleared exports had accelerated since May while their volume had also reversed to a decrease, and went on to state that Japan’s export restrictions had the potential to substantially disrupt Korea’s production and exports depending on how the situation developed going forward, and thus it would be necessary to map out and analyze various scenarios concerning potential downside risks.
The member projected that domestic inflation would continue its gradual deceleration.
The member went on to state the necessity of closely monitoring the effects on the Korean economy of the recent rebound in international oil prices and of the monetary policy decisions of the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and other major country central banks scheduled for this month.
won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements.
Looking at recent price conditions, the member saw that, as factors pointed to as upside risks such as an ongoing upward trend in commodity prices and prolonged global supply bottlenecks were materializing, strong upward trends in prices were witnessed across core items.
- Looking at the Korean economy, while export growth has slowed somewhat the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic demand has not been strong and the sentiments of economic agents remain weak.
The member evaluated that, since a rise in production activities driven by exports and the manufacturing industry was seen to have led to a recovery in employment and household income and the uptrend in prices had been spreading due to the pressures on inflation from the consumption demand side following the lifting of social distancing restrictions, there was good reason for maintaining the rate hike stance.
After briefings by staff on “Recent Economic Developments,” “FX and International Finance” and “Financial Market Trends,” the discussions of the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas: Members evaluated that, despite slower growth in emerging market economies (EMEs), the global economy had continued to show strong growth, led for instance by the buoyancy of the US economy.
The member noted that other instruments of the Bank of Korea should be used when necessary concerning the Bank’s role as market maker and as lender of last resort, while the government’s macroprudential policies should be used first to manage economic agents’ leverage, risk-taking behaviors, and asset prices.
The member stated that with the time lag of monetary policy being long and variable, the effects of monetary policy could sometimes last until when it was no longer necessary.
Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to near 2%.
although the increase in the number of employed slowed in September due to temporary factors, the trend of improvement led by the private sector appears to be continuing.
The member also expressed the opinion that the Base Rate should be held at its current level for the intermeeting period, and efforts should be made to return the Korean economy onto a stable path of growth as early as possible, by considering in a balanced manner the macro-economic risks to growth and prices together with risks to financial stability, while at the same time taking note of any changes in global financial and economic conditions.
The member added that a more accommodative fiscal policy would be underway this year, enhancing the contribution of fiscal expenditure to growth.
The member stated that the number of persons employed in December last year had declined at a much faster pace following the third wave of COVID-19, and went on to judge that the worsening of employment conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 had resulted in a substantial degree of slack in the domestic labor market.
The member noted that, under the current domestic and international economic conditions, maintaining the current accommodative stance was inevitable, and this stance would have to be sustained for some time.
First, with the slumps in exports and manufacturing production continuing, there were significant uncertainties as to the future growth path and as to whether the present economic recovery dependent on fiscal policy could persist, and there were also domestic and overseas risk factors, including corporate restructuring and Brexit, and so a careful watch was needed on whether economic growth after the second quarter of this year would reach the potential growth rate, as had been forecast.
The 1st Vice Minister remarked, however, that the current account had posted a surplus of 4.2 billion dollars in October, wider than that of the previous month, and that it was estimated to have recorded a substantial surplus in November as well.
Members saw that, although consumer price inflation had risen at a slightly faster pace due to one-off factors such as rising agricultural product prices, demand-side inflationary pressures were still weak.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had fallen and interest rates had risen, amid foreigners’ securities investment funds having flowed out on concerns about QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and that the Korean won had appreciated in line mainly with the current account surplus.
Concerning future inflation, the member forecast that upside risks would somewhat predominate in the short term, but with the effects of supply-side factors gradually diminishing, inflation would not deviate far from the January forecast path in the medium term.
The member assessed that Korea’s recovery had been sustained since the second half of 2023.
However, the improvements in the euro area have weakened.
The moderate recovery in the euro area had continued, bolstered by increased production, while economic growth in China had continued to slow.
ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.
Looking at the economic conditions at home and abroad since the previous monetary policy decision meeting, the member evaluated that the economic shocks from COVID-19 appeared to have somewhat passed their peak, but uncertainties surrounding the recovery path seemed to remain high.
After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea' and the 'Financial Markets', the discussions by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) covered the following areas: Most members assessed that the global economy was sustaining its recovery overall, but that uncertainties were deepening further due to latent risk factors.
The member also noted that there would be a need to ensure space for monetary policy to some extent to prepare for a possibility of underlying low economic growth and the future economic cycle.
- The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability.
With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had remained unchanged from the previous month’s 0.4%, and that core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products had fallen to slightly below the preceding month’s level at 2.0%.
Concerning the domestic economy, the member noted that the number of persons employed remained on a sharp rise and exports continued to be strong, while the recovery in facilities and construction investment had been delayed due to supply-side factors.
The member expected inflation to increase, albeit modestly, due mainly to rises in some public utility fees going forward.
The member expressed concerns that, although inflation in Korea had been expected to remain low throughout this year, the recent sluggishness of the real economy, inflation, and ultimately the entire economy was increasingly likely to be prolonged.
The member added that these forecasts reflected the widening of corrections in facilities and construction investment, and the negative impacts of the US-China trade dispute on exports.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that stock prices had shifted to sharp declines, long-term market interest rates had risen significantly, and the Korean won had also depreciated to a considerable extent, affected mainly by the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing.
However, Mr. Ha, Seong Keun expressed clear opposition to the idea of holding the Base Rate at its current level, and argued for a 0.25 percentage point cut.
The member evaluated that private consumption was showing a sign of renewed improvement, albeit modest, bolstered by the relaxing of disease control measures, and the partial slowing of the spread of COVID-19, although recent supply chain disruptions and the heightened possibility of global economic slowdown were exerting a drag on the outlook for exports.
The member noted that the trend of world economic recovery had been spreading since the second half of last year, and the gradual monetary policy normalization in the US was proceeding smoothly.
The member added that it would be necessary to preemptively come up with financial support measures for vulnerable borrowers with weak debt-servicing capacity and SMEs with little access to financial services.
He expressed the opinion that there were thus concerns about a possible heightening of financial instability in the event of a future rise in interest rates, and so it was necessary to carry out micro analysis and to develop countermeasures in response.
In this regard, the member mentioned that it would be important to reduce the degree of monetary easing to weaken inefficient incentives for investment and curb financial imbalances.
Stock prices have fallen again, after having risen substantially, in line with shifts in the flows of foreigners’ stock investment funds, and the Korean won has depreciated recently, after having sustained a trend of appreciation due to continuation of the current account surplus.
The member, however, expressed concern that Korea’s economic growth in the upper-2 percent range, while consistent with the potential growth rate, was led by construction investment, and housing construction in particular, which was expanding at an unsustainable rate.
In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have declined affected by the resurgence of COVID-19.
The member also judged that, to prepare for a global economic downturn and the major impacts it would have on the Korean economy, it would be important at this point in time to prevent the accumulation of financial imbalances while carrying out intensive structural reforms to enhance the efficiency of the economy as a whole and to ensure policy space.
The member assessed that the global economy had continued to recover as in the previous year, but the pace of recovery had been slowing recently affected largely by the spread of Omicron, and inflation had continued to grow in major countries owing to the further uptrend in energy prices and prolonged disruptions in global supply chains.
Another member advocated the need for maintaining the Base Rate at its current level this month, while at the same time closely monitoring the effects of the economic policies put in place so far by the Bank of Korea and the Korean government, the changes in sentiment of economic agents, the strength of the domestic demand recovery, household lending trends, and the possibility of a change in the US Fed’s monetary policy stance.
While pivot risk on the inflation side has significantly decreased, pivot risk on the financial stability side stemming from the expansion of housing price growth has increased.
The member expressed the view that, while the accommodative monetary policy thus far had been working as a factor causing faster growth in household debt, it was assessed to have contributed greatly to easing deflation concerns by limiting the possibility of further deterioration in domestic economic activity amid difficult economic environments at home and abroad.
The member assessed that the domestic economy continued to recover and private consumption was picking up rapidly boosted by the rising vaccination rate, the easing of social-distancing measures and the implementation of the supplementary budget.
One member noted, however, that it was rather premature to consider the improvements in some economic indicators as implying a shift to economic recovery from the second half of this year, and that no clear momentum driving an economic recovery domestically was seen.
However, the member pointed out that the gap between economic indicators and economic sentiment had been widening even further, as improvement in exports had been enjoyed only by some industries and domestic demand including consumption and construction had been sluggish.
The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in line with changes in the value of the dollar globally.
In June, consumer price inflation eased to 2.4%, driven by a substantial deceleration in agricultural product price increases, while core inflation remained in the low it is important to remain vigilant about the developments and impacts of major upside risk factors, such as international oil prices, exchange rates, and agricultural product prices.
The member also mentioned that corporate financing had been generally favorable and growth in household loans, particularly unsecured ones, had accelerated again.
Members stressed, however, that attention should be paid to the possibility of renewed financial market unrest due to the high uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and also to the widening disparity between the recovery of financial markets and the sluggishness of the real economy.
The member thus presented the opinion that, given this point, it would be necessary to decide the pace of tightening cautiously going forward, examining the effect of Base Rate hikes so far and keeping a close watch on the developments of factors causing domestic and overseas uncertainties.
The member assessed inflation as nearing its target over a medium-term horizon amid weak but sustained demand-side pressures, and expected that a slight reduction of the accommodative monetary policy stance was unlikely to weaken demand-side pressures enough to have a significant effect on inflation but could contribute to curbing the widening of financial imbalances somewhat.
Members voiced concerns that, as household and business sentiments were contracting, growth in private consumption showed signs of weakening.
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled reflecting the views of the majority.
One other member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25% level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.
Facilities investment has slightly increased and consumption growth has expanded, although construction investment and exports have continued to decline.
Looking at the financial situation, the member assessed that the current Base Rate was analyzed to be in restrictive territory, running well above the neutral rate range, while overall financial conditions had become much less tight compared with the previous year-end.
such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while the economy continues its sound growth.
First, the member noted that there existed latent risks of increases in agricultural product and energy prices as well as existing supply shocks from geopolitical risks.
One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current The member saw that, as trade disputes had escalated and political uncertainties had heightened since the previous MPB meeting, volatility in the global financial markets had increased and the trend of low growth had become further entrenched.
The member assessed that exports had been showing a faster-than-expected recovery, driven by growth in semiconductor exports and a slower decline in exports to China since September.
The member thus added that it would be necessary to observe a little longer to see whether these trends would continue.
Exports had posted negative growth in August, as in the previous month, affected chiefly by sharp decreases in those of major items including ships, automobiles and steel, and by the vacation season.
However, the member judged uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be heightened further, since major countries were changing their monetary policy stances rapidly to respond to higher inflation since the second half of last year, and geopolitical risks surrounding Ukraine were also increasing.
However, the member suggested a few reasons for preferring keeping the Base Rate unchanged, despite such concern.
The member went on to present the opinion that the foreign exchange policy authorities should therefore scrupulously and preemptively examine potential risk factors, while developing appropriate measures to bring about market stability under different possible scenarios.
The member raised the concern that excessively high leverage and housing prices could reduce consumption and investment capacities and worsen economic inequalities in the long term.
Accordingly, the member stated the view that it was desirable at this juncture to assess the direction of future interest rate policy based on a detailed analysis of the degree to which downside risks to growth and inflation would increase.
The member also took the view that, while exports were picking up in accordance with the global economic recovery, it would be necessary to promote structural reform rapidly and rearrange medium- and long-term strategies to create an environment in which households can shift from leveraged spending to income-based spending, and also to continue to prepare for population ageing through overseas investment.
One member presented the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.
Concerning inflation, members saw that consumer price inflation had declined sharply, due mainly to a decline in petroleum product prices, and expected that it would fluctuate for some time below 1 percent amid modest demand-side inflationary pressures.
The member also stressed that the monetary authority should examine all possible policy measures and consider how to implement them in response to the slow growth and low inflation dragging on.
However, it is worth noting that delinquency rates are rising among households and SMEs, and there has been a recent rebound in household loans, as well as a steady increase in corporate loans.
In particular, the member commented that growth of monetary aggregates such as M2 and Lf had been on the rise, as funding to corporations had expanded thanks to improved sales performances and the easing of credit risk aversion, and as household and sole proprietor loans had also been increasing steadily.
Meanwhile, the member stated that manufactoring and service production-related indicators in the second quarter seemed to have been somewhat insufficient to be confident that the trend of economic recovery in the previous quarter was continuing.
Looking at the estimates of output and inflation gaps based on the discussion above, the member judged that the Bank of Korea would have to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance, but unlike advanced countries that had experienced massive deleveraging since the global financial crisis in 2008, Korea had seen steady household debt growth and thus financial stability was gaining even greater importance.
He then noted that the government’s policy focus would be placed on such areas as price stability, boosting domestic demand and expanding the social safety net.
The member added that the abrupt exchange rate fluctuations in the US dollar, the yen and the euro, stemming from policy divergences among major advanced country central banks, signified that the promises made at the Seoul G20 Summit in 2010 were no longer being followed, and expressed the view that, against this backdrop, Korea should not only seek actively to reduce exchange rate volatility, but also devote efforts to securing various possible policy tools.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, members pointed out that, after having declined under the influence of the movements of major country government bond yields, long-term market interest rates had risen with the improvements in economic indicators, causing the spread between long- and short-term rates to widen.
Members assessed the domestic financial markets to be showing an overall pattern of stability as stock prices had risen and the exchange rate had fluctuated within a narrow range on the back of the improved domestic and overseas environment including, for instance, the upgrade of Korea’s sovereign rating.
Most members evaluated the domestic economy as maintaining its solid underlying trend of growth along the originally-projected growth path.
The member added that it should be noted that the transmission of accommodative monetary policy could be limited if a crowding-out effect from increased Treasury bond issuance caused market interest rates to rise significantly or continued global dollar weakness accelerated the appreciation of the Korean won.
dissented from this decision, and argued that the Base Rate should be raised by 25 basis points.)
The member also mentioned that, according to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey by Statistics Korea, the monthly average household income for the third quarter grew by 8.0% year on year and earned income by 6.2%, and income showed even growth across all decile groups, indicating that the economic recovery was leading to household income growth.
Mortgage lending posted a steady rise in July, as in the previous month.
- The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has improved moderately, although investment has slowed somewhat.
Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in the euro area.
The member judged that the economy would be able to withstand the growth loss stemming from rate hikes in light of the prospect that domestic demand would maintain relatively solid growth next year as well as this year.
The member also noted the ongoing corrections in facilities investment, which had shown a sharp increase last year in the semiconductor sector in particular, and in construction investment, which had remained buoyant for the past several years.
The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has continued its uptrend seen since October of last year, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar globally.
However, concerns about the buildup of financial imbalances have increased due to rising housing prices and expanding household loan growth.
The member noted that households’ real purchase power did not improve last year, as the rate of increase in total wage bill was offset by consumer price inflation, which apparently weighed on consumption.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the changes in the domestic and international economic environments, it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
Most members expressed the view that, although exports were increasing constantly, boosted by the mild recovery in the global economy, export conditions were likely to be affected by the higher volatility of the KRW/USD exchange rate, a rise in raw material prices, and the unstable future directions of the economies in advanced countries and China.
One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, based on the judgment that it would be appropriate to determine when to raise the Base Rate after further examining whether the uptrend in prices would accelerate or continue.
Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that, along with sluggish exports, facilities and construction investment had continued to undergo adjustments, while private consumption had continued to grow albeit slowly.
In particular, the member noted that the increasing of tax benefits available on the Bank of Korea web site.
Given these points, the member stated that it had become more important to judge if the Korean economy would recover in the second half of this year in line with the Bank’s forecast.
This was because, although a slight downward shift in the growth path in line with the export shock from sluggish external demand was estimated to have brought about the widening of the negative GDP gap, domestic demand was expected to show a modest recovery due to improved economic sentiment, along with the gradual easing of export sluggishness.
The member’s assessment was that, while facilities investment was undergoing an adjustment, exports were maintaining high growth, bolstered by solid global demand, and private consumption was maintaining an underlying trend of recovery, thanks to a favorable increase in consumption of goods, despite a slight slowdown in face-to-face service consumption stemming from the worsening of the spread of the pandemic.
The member evaluated that there was ample liquidity in the market as a result of two Base Rate cuts and various measures to increase liquidity supply since March.
Accordingly, the member projected that the growth rate for the year would be 1.4%, slightly lower than the February projection of 1.6%.
The Monetary Policy Committee Members' discussions on changes in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members agreed that, although the Base Rate needed to be restored to a normal level before long, in view of the high economic growth and inflation rates, it should be left at its current level this month considering that economic uncertainty at home and abroad remained high and that tension between countries over foreign exchange rates had recently been escalating further.
The member stressed the need for attention to a possible rise in asset prices and to the consequent possibility of excessive credit expansion stemming mostly from overheated sentiment in the new housing market and the lack of a system of risk management for collective loans issued by financial institutions.
Fourth, there was still substantial spare capacity in both production and employment, with the manufacturing operation ratio remaining at a low level and broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate increasing.
The member judged the financial markets to still remain accommodative.
Among them, one member assessed that, although consumption and investment in the Korean economy had been showing trends of modest improvement, exports had exhibited a larger-than-expected trend of decline, downside risks to domestic growth and prices had become greater due to the emergence of external uncertainties in line with the global economic slowdown, household debt had maintained strong growth, and volatility and unrest in the foreign exchange market had heightened.
Some members noted that individual perceptions of prices and inflation expectations had also increased, in line with a substantial number of items in the CPI basket rising significantly and processed food and dining-out prices growing.
The member expected the positive GDP gap to widen gradually after the second quarter, as the economy would continue to show growth exceeding its potential level.
The member emphasized that, since the credit spreads of corporate bonds had widened due to aversion to credit risk, it was necessary to closely monitor the relevant developments.
Although the real estate sector is likely to remain stable for the time being, uncertainties are high.
All MPB members supported the decision unanimously.
The member assessed domestic real economic fundamentals as being overall similar to those previously forecast.
With regard to financial stability, the member took the view that the current slowing trend, albeit slight, of household debt growth would likely continue, as the effects of strengthened micro-level regulations had started to materialize and were combined with the effects of the reduction in the degree of monetary easing, but continued vigilance would be necessary as household debt growth had continued to outpace income growth and demand for household loans was likely to be substantial amid a rise in the number of move-in ready apartments.
The member then expressed the view that vigilance was needed in order to avoid falling into a liquidity trap in the medium and long term.
The member added that Korea, with its three Base Rate hikes since August last year, is one of the major countries which started normalizing monetary policy preemptively.
The member thus emphasized the need for thorough monitoring of various possible upside and downside risk factors.
However, the member expressed the need to determine the time and pace of an additional Base Rate hike depending on developments in economic and financial conditions.
This member continued by noting that if the Bank Intermediation Support Facility, a non interest-rate policy tool, were utilized, it could minimize the growth of household debt and have an economic stimulus effect by channeling credit into corporate lending only, with household lending excluded.
After pointing out that exports had continued to decline for the fourth month in a row, and that exports to Japan and the euro area in particular had fallen to considerable extents, due largely to the depreciations of the Japanese yen and the euro, he went on to point out that, although Korea continued to run a substantial bilateral current account deficit against Japan, the imbalance in the won/yen exchange rate had been worsening recently due to the yen’s weakness while the won had been feeling appreciation pressures owing to Korea‘s widening bilateral current account surplus vis-a-vis the US.
The member pointed out that, as concerns had recently been raised about exports driven by the electrical and electronic industry, the relevant trends should be analyzed closely.
The member also added that the accommodative monetary policy stance should be kept unchanged in order to supplement and support an expansionary fiscal policy.
The member, however, emphasized that forecasts of future economic trends had become more uncertain due to geopolitical risks, such as Korea's deployment of THAAD and the North Korea nuclear issue.
Finally, the member judged that, with the US Federal Reserve highly likely to lower its policy rate in July, concerns about the widening of the interest rate gap between Korea and the US, which had been showing an inversion, could ease to some extent, given a change in the monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve.
prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to the larger increase in petroleum product prices.
The member stated that the decrease in global goods trade had not been as large as previously forecast and Korea’s exports would accordingly recover faster than originally expected.
The member noted that the government’s fiscal policy space was reduced, private consumption was restrained by structural factors and thus unlikely to drive economic recovery, and there was no high possibility of exports recovering within a short space of time, as the lack of global growth momentum continued.
Looking ahead the Bank of Korea forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices diminish.
The member noted that, more specifically, the housing price growth rate based on the Housing Price Index had stood at 1.1% in 2018 and –0.4% in 2019, and housing prices outside of the Seoul metropolitan area in particular had continued to fall for the second consecutive year, suggesting that an overall housing price surge related to liquidity conditions was not materializing.
The member assessed that foreign reserves were currently abundant, the short-term external debt ratio was relatively low, the banking sector was maintaining a favorable level of soundness, and the correlation coefficient of flows of funds for bond investment in Korea and emerging market countries had decreased, all of which could be seen as positive factors.
and financial unrest in EMEs.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members mentioned that long-term market interest rates had fallen and stock prices had risen with the stabilization of the international financial markets, but the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had remained highly volatile and bank household lending had declined.
One member expressed the opinion that, while maintaining the Base Rate at its current 1.25 percent level for the intermeeting period, the Bank of Korea should keep a close watch on changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and in particular on developments of domestic and overseas risk factors and their impacts.
The member added that the won-dollar exchage rate had rapidly increased recently, as expectations of future U.S. monetary policy had been adjusted.
Concerning corporate credit, meanwhile, the downturn phase of the corporate credit cycle had continued owing to the sharp decreases at both large corporations and SMEs and to sustained net corporate bond redemptions.
Other members pointed out that housing prices were continuing to increase despite the fact that households’ mortgage interest rates had recently risen above the pre-pandemic level.
Long-term government bond yields in major economies, which had fallen in anticipation of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, rose again due to factors such as economic indicators surpassing market expectations, and the U.S. dollar also showed strength.
The member projected that the domestic economy would likely continue to improve modestly, with a weaker consumption recovery, but with ongoing strong exports.
The member expressed the view that, although the global economy had overall maintained favorable growth and global trade had rebounded in the second quarter, uncertainties had increased, since, from the second half of this year, the repercussions of the US-China trade dispute were likely to increase more than originally expected and the US Federal Reserve was forecast to continue to normalize its monetary policy in line with the sustained US economic growth.
The member also expressed concerns that the pandemic was likely to accelerate the trend of the outflow of population from provincial areas and the inflow of population into Seoul and its surrounding areas, which had slowed for some time.
In addition, one member made the point that rate normalization must be carried forward persistently so as to allow real interest rates to move out of negative territory, in that, should a low interest rate stance prevail for a long time, there was concern that economic imbalances could deepen largely owing to an expansion of household debt and delay in corporate restructuring and that the high level of macro leverage could pose a potential risk for the Korean economy.
Concerning the global economy, the member noted that the possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy was rising, supported by brisk consumption and production based on solid employment.
The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, many members assessed the stock, bond and foreign exchange markets to have all exhibited stable movements, with the soothing of market sentiment and inflows of foreigners’ portfolio investment funds driven chiefly by the additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries and Korea’s sovereign rating upgrade.
One member took the view that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to The member mentioned that the recovery in the global economy had slowed somewhat and there were high uncertainties, both upside and downside, in line with geopolitical risks, monetary policies in major countries and the development of China’s COVID-19 restrictions.
Going forward the Committee judges that the global economy will show a recovery, albeit a moderate one, but that downside risks to growth are high, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing.
However, the member commented that in order to effectively address the accumulated household debt, it would be desirable to assess not only the overall quantity of household debt, but also its qualitative aspects, including evaluations of risk weighted HH debt amounts based on the distribution of DSR.
Long term market interest rates have declined in response to the planned reduction in the volume of Treasury bond issuance and foreigners' sustained bond purchases.
Externally, the member noted the growing concerns about the US-China trade dispute, expressing the opinion that if trade protectionism became more globally widespread, consumption and investment could be constrained greatly through strengthened risk aversion, although losses in exports stemming from already finalized trade sanctions were estimated to have been limited.
The member thus stated that it would be desirable to continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon.
The member expected that the economic spillover effects of COVID-19, which had been spreading rapidly since the February MPB meeting, would be greater and last longer than previously forecast.
Finally, the member emphasized that the best policy to achieve the inflation target under the current economic conditions was to minimize production capacity losses.
With respect to the financial and foreign exchange sectors, the member assessed that economic agents’ search-for-yield across asset markets had abated, and macroprudential indicators appeared favorable in the internal and external sectors.
Another member pointed out that the uncertainties on the external front had increased with the recovery in the euro area being blown off course following the Greek crisis and with the persistent sluggishness in China and other emerging market countries even as the timing of a US interest rate hike approached.
Meanwhile, the member noted that, as exports had grown at a faster pace for the fourth consecutive month since November last year, due mainly to increased demand in the global semiconductor market and recoveries in petroleum product exports in line with rising oil prices, there was a heightened possibility that this could represent a trend going forward.
risen as foreigners’ stock investment funds have recorded net inflows in line with continued risk-taking tendencies globally.
They meanwhile forecast that economic activity would maintain its upward trend in the future as well, driven largely by the economic recovery centering around advanced countries and by the improvements in domestic demand conditions.
The member argued that, considering financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, the Base Rate should be kept at the current level for this meeting.
Meanwhile, the member’s evaluation was that housing price growth had accelerated, particularly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and home purchase sentiment and expectations of higher housing prices were also rising again.
The member thus stated that the outlook for future growth paths was more uncertain than in the past.
A majority of members forecast that the inflation rate would remain at a stable level below the midpoint of its target for the time being, with the easing of inflationary pressures owing primarily to the economic slowdown and to international oil price stability.
Finally, the member noted that, from the perspective of the Balance of Payments, Korea generally saw sustained net inflows of foreign domestic bond investment funds during the past inversions of the US and Korean policy rates, but judged that if the inversion period were to last longer with the interest rate gap widening going forward, it would not be easy to rule out a possibility of some foreign capital outflows.
- Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-3% range due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of personal services and industrial products.
The member pointed out that these growth imbalances were highly likely to continue even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.
The member thus noted that it was necessary to prevent, as much as possible, the coronavirus shock from leading to permanent damage to the foundation for growth.
The member, however, evaluated that the subsequent spread of the virus to the rest of the world, including the US and Europe, had developed into a crisis situation that raised concerns about shocks to global economic activity and global financial markets.
The member expressed the opinion that, if the trend of an easing of disease control measures being followed by a rebound in consumption repeated itself, the recent resurgence of the pandemic would likely to have a limited impact on aggregate demand or the underlying economic trend over the medium to long term horizon.
Another member stated that it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to On the domestic economic front, the member stated that economic growth was slowing more rapidly than initially projected.
The member, however, noted that concerns about a global economic slowdown remained and a super boom in the business cycle of the semiconductor industry was entering a correction phase, and thus it was necessary to pay attention to the future developments.
The member added that, considering various external soundness indicators, Korea was unlikely to be affected greatly by a US policy rate hike, but it would be necessary to work in closer cooperation with the government going forward while strengthening the monitoring of domestic and overseas financial market trends.
With regard to the domestic financial markets, meanwhile, members noted that interest rates and stock prices had dropped significantly and the Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar, with Korea seeing outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds brought about in part by developments in international financial markets.
In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have accelerated in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country.
One other member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.
The member assessed that the employment situation was favorable overall, with the number of persons employed continuing to rise and the unemployment rate remaining low.
Meanwhile, the member noted that, while the risk of financial imbalances related to domestic household debt was easing gradually, banks had been gradually relaxing their lending attitudes of late.
The member saw that the real economy could not deviate greatly from the potential GDP path, although consideration should also be given to the quality of employment, demographic changes, and the possibility of structural change during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen to the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range.
The member then argued that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50% for the intermeeting period, while more closely monitoring major factors affecting the growth and stability of the Korean economy.
The member also saw that the future recovery of the domestic economy was dependent upon how the COVID-19 situation would develop.
Incorporating the outcome of the above discussions, the following Monetary Policy Decision statement was compiled.
The member, however, judged that business conditions had been sluggish in the areas of the private sector not directly linked with fiscal support, and with respect to the labor market as well there was little meaningful employment growth to be found in the private service sector apart from health care and social welfare.
The member also noted that it would be necessary to prepare against the possibility of shocks to vulnerable groups developing into systemic risks in order to fulfill the central bank’s mandate of ensuring financial stability, and that it would also be necessary to pay attention to overseas factors.
Meanwhile, the member emphasized that, although the implementation of the Measures for the Management of Household Debt announced in August was expected to gradually curb the pace of household lending growth, it was necessary to continually keep a close watch on the trend of household lending given the existence of factors fueling an increase in lending demand, such as a buoyant Seoul metropolitan housing market.
The member stated that, at a time when U.S. dollar supply and demand conditions had been worsening for some time, it would be important to closely monitor global risk factors and changes in indicators of external soundness in order to maintain Korea’s international credit standing.
Accordingly, the member noted that it would be better to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
Incorporating the outcome of their earlier discussions, a statement was compiled with the unanimous consent of all members.
As for the global financial markets, members judged that, as risk aversion had increased, due for instance to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute, stock prices had fallen and the currencies of emerging economies had depreciated.
The member however evaluated that, although inflation had exceeded the target in most countries, measures to cope with this varied from country to country.
After the discussions detailed above, all members agreed on maintaining the Bank of Korea Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period, and passed a resolution to this effect[3)].
are posted on the Bank of Korea website.
This member went on to note that, while the trend of a narrowing of the price gap itself had not changed, there was a possibility that its pace would be quite moderate.
Another member mentioned that the global economy was expected to show higher growth than initially expected earlier this year, thanks to the strong performance of advanced countries and the resumption of economic activity in China.
The member also noted that, as the effects of the central bank’s monetary policy ultimately depended on the behavior of commercial banks that are at the center of monetary policy transmissions, it would be also important to assess the capacity of Korean commercial banks to create credit and seek measures to enhance such capacity.
The member pointed out that, in this situation, the COVID-19 outbreak was placing an additional burden on the domestic economy.
Some members saw that rises in international commodity prices and agricultural and livestock product prices were leading to a second round of spillover effects such as rises in durable goods and dining-out prices.
Another member argued that the slack in the labor market would work as a factor reducing the upward pressures on wages and inflation.
Some members expressed the view that the economy had already passed beyond the recovery phase and had entered an expansionary phase.
large corporations and the exacerbation of household debt problems caused by higher market interest rates.
Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed.
The member stated that net household assets relative to GDP in Korea were falling below the OECD average, and the pace of population aging was likely to be twice the OECD average in the future.
First, the member noted that although the real economy was showing export-oriented and facilities investment-led growth, the buoyancy of exports had been confined to the IT industry, mainly in semiconductors, and since such strength was attributable to increases in unit export prices rather than growth in export volume, it was not likely to stimulate much additional production in related industries.
The member evaluated that the improvement in private consumption had moderated somewhat, owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, but the moderation had not been as severe as during the previous resurgences, thanks to learning effects from the past and changes in consumption patterns.
One member took the view that it would be appropriate to leave the Base Rate unchanged from its current level of 1.25 percent this month.
Another member stated his opinion that a small downward adjustment of the Base Rate from its current level of 1.75% would be advisable since, with the exception of the trend of changes in household lending other recent policy conditions were all indicating a need for further monetary policy easing.
The member noted that it would be appropriate to adjust the pace of tightening going forward, depending on the evolution of domestic and overseas economic conditions in the future.
Another member judged that it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the Base Rate to 1.00% from the current 0.75%.
- In the financial markets, long-term and short-term market interest rates and stock prices have shown a sharp run-up in line with the improvements in economic activity.
On the other hand, the member argued that there remained serious concerns about worsening financial imbalances, since household loans in the financial sector maintained their subtantial increase to more than six trillion won, driven chiefly by government-sponsored loans.
The member explained that these doubts had been raised because accumulated financial imbalances may have already been expanded due to interest rates, which should play the most important role in resource allocation, remaining low for a long period.
The member, however, presented the view that the recent situation, with no visible change in prices and a large slowdown in employment growth, implied that aggregate demand was not expanding.
Looking at financial conditions, the member’s evaluation was that excessive yield-seeking behavior had been easing somewhat, with stock prices fluctuating within a narrow range and household debt continuing to exhibit slower growth.
One member expressed the view that, while keeping a careful watch for example on the situation of risks in the Chinese economy, and on the monetary policy operations of major advanced countries, it would be wise to closely examine the influences of these factors on the domestic economy, prices and financial market conditions.
that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, major advanced economies have exhibited signs of sluggishness.
GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, below the April forecast (2.5%).
In this regard, it was deemed appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level at this meeting.
5-year Treasury bond yields in Korea and the US had been inverted since mid-December 2016, following 10-year Treasury bond yields.
As a result, the member added that the financial market had witnessed a substantial decline in government bond yields, while credit spreads for corporate bonds had widenend.
The member’s assessment of financial stability was positive.
mainly to concerns about an economic slowdown in China, but have since then shifted to a rise in line chiefly with the continuation of improvements in US economic activity.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50%, while one member argued for raising it by One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at the current level of 0.50%.
The member expressed the opinion that the decrease in the contribution of exports to real growth would be smaller than the decrease in export value but still considerable.
He pointed out that, although foreign portfolio investment funds had experienced large outflows in July and the won had depreciated against the dollar, this was attributable to a weakening of the won in line with the global strength of the US dollar, and to some EMEs’ need to secure foreign currency liquidity, rather than to changes in Korea’s economic fundamentals.
Another member noted that efforts should be exerted to preemptively block the possibility of expected inflation working as a factor amplifying the second-round effects from supply shocks, and that there was a need to develop more active communication strategies, particularly given that the scope for operation of interest rate policy was limited.
Members, meanwhile, assessed that, although prices of some financial assets had undergone corrections due to stronger expectations for policy rate hikes at home and abroad, financial conditions still remained accommodative.
declines in leading indicators for two consecutive months.
The member indicated that the semiconductor industry appeared to be bottoming out, boosted by production cuts at major suppliers and by AI-related demand.
in November, due mainly to declines in petroleum product prices and to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase.
Meanwhile, the member added that household debt had exhibited another sharp rise in June and the rate of growth in M2 and other liquidity indicators remained high.
As a result, growth in the first quarter had fallen short of the original forecast, and thus there was an increased possibility of a widening negative GDP gap.
The member mentioned that this forecast implied that the factors that had negatively affected the domestic economy in the first quarter would not do so or would even positively affect the Korean economy going forward.
Second, there must be economic restructuring and housing price stabilization.
Members also evaluated that the favorable conditions in international financial markets would continue for the time being, but FX and asset market volatility was likely to increase in line largely with changes in major countries’ monetary policies.
The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened in response chiefly to low lending rates, even though house transactions have been inactive.
The main details of the MPC Members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: Most members shared the opinion that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international economic environments and the future outlooks for both, it would be desirable this month to cut the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point from its current level for the intermeeting period.
The member went on to assert that in the past, such developments often formed a virtuous circle with the real sector economy through improved consumer and business sentiment, with some time lag.
With regard to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation stood at 1.4%, lower than in the previous month, and forecast that it would remain at a low level for the time being.
Concerning the domestic economy, the member projected that the recovery momentum for consumption would weaken, while exports and facilities investment would continue to improve moderately, led by the recovery in the global semiconductor business.
First, there must be a stabilization of the foreign exchange market.
The member estimated that, although financial conditions had become less accommodative, due to a steep rise in market interest rates entering this year, the real Base Rate had fallen below the average for last year and was running considerably below the neutral interest rate.
However, Mr. Lee, Il Houng and Mr. Koh, Seung Beom expressed clear opposition to the idea of keeping the Base Rate at its current level and argued for raising it by 0.25 of a percentage point.
The member also expressed the view that, with the risk aversion tendencies in the domestic and overseas financial markets having strengthened, stock prices had fallen and EME currencies including the Korean won had weakened, and as a result, household and corporate economic sentiment had weakened.
The member expected that the sustained accommodative stance, combined with the expansionary fiscal policy, would contribute to driving demand-side pressures and maintaining inflation expectations.
In global financial markets, risk aversion has strengthened due to the acceleration of policy rate hikes in major countries and consequent concerns about economic slowdown.
The main details of the MPB members’ discussions concerning a change in the Bank of Korea Base Rate were as follows: The majority of members presented the view that, in overall consideration of the domestic and international financial and economic environments, it would be desirable to lower the Base Rate by One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to lower the Base Rate from the current 1.25% to 0.75%.
The members forecast the domestic economy to grow by 2.6 percent this year and next, with the contribution of fiscal expenditure to growth likely to increase, and mentioned that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path were high, due mainly to changes in monetary and trade policies―particularly in the US―and concerns about a possible Chinese economic slowdown.
The member assessed that, with the global economy continuing to improve, the Korean economy had maintained its trend of recovery led by exports, and private consumption had been recovering at a modest pace.
The delinquency rate on corporate lending has increased and real estate project financing risks have remained, but, for now, their impacts on the financial system as a whole seem limited.
The member meanwhile presented the view that, although the Chinese economy had been recovering rapidly since its reopening, led by domestic demand, the country’s imports and exports had continued to decline due to the sluggishness of the global IT industry and a high level of inventory, which would likely limit the growth path of the global economy.
The member judged that, despite persistently high uncertainties and risk factors, including higher-for-longer rates, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain segmentation, many countries had been witnessing their growth and inflation returning to their equilibrium levels, boosted by aggressive monetary and fiscal policy responses so far, achieving a soft landing of their economies.
The member noted that consumer price inflation, which had rebounded to 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, fell back to 2.8% in January this year driven by a weakening in demand pressures and a decline in oil prices.
The member also expected that it would likely to take substantial time for the export-driven economic recovery to lead to stable expansion of household income, wages, employment and consumption.
- Consumer price inflation has slightly risen within the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the smaller decline in petroleum product prices.
In this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the resurgence of COVID in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.
After briefings by staff on _Recent Economic Developments_ (July 2022),[2)] _FX and_ Monetary Policy Board (MPB) members covered the following areas.
Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the lower-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed at the mid-1% level.
Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints.
As to domestic financial markets, many members attributed the large fluctuation in price variables, including interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates, to external factors such as the possibility of an escalation of the sovereign debt problems in Europe and a slowdown in U.S. economic recovery.
First, the sensitivity of the financial sector and risks from the financial stability perspective had increased following the SVB crisis.
The member also noted that, coupled with rising inflation expectations, the increase in perceived inflation among individuals ― driven by the recent rise in consumer prices, especially for daily necessities, such as agricultural and energy products ― could also contribute to a gradual slowdown in overall inflation.
Long-term market interest rates have risen, in response mainly to expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and of an increased volume of Korean Treasury bond issuance.
However, the member saw that the recent improvements in investor sentiment in global financial markets were greatly diverging from the tightening monetary policy stances in major countries, including the US, and took the view that attention should be paid to the point that instability in the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets could recur in the process of policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Members assessed that inflation remained high, with consumer price inflation standing at the upper-5% level and core inflation and inflation expectations among the general public at the lower-4% level, boosted by the acceleration of the rise in processed food prices and the hike in electricity and gas fees, more than offsetting the slowing growth in petroleum product prices.
As positive points, the member mentioned the relative stability of international financial markets, thanks for instance to changes in the monetary policy stances of major advanced economies, and the increasing possibility of an agreement in the US-China trade dispute.
The member, however, judged that uncertainty surrounding the recovery path had not yet been eased substantially.
The member presented the opinion that household loans exhibited slower growth owing to a decline in other loans, while housing-related loans sustained strong growth.
The domestic economy was estimated to have grown faster than originally projected during the first quarter, as construction investment, previously forecast to undergo a correction, had shown more favorable movements than expected, and consumer sentiment and the sentiment of domestic demand-oriented companies, including those in the services sector, had been showing signs of recovery.
The member added that these policy efforts were expected to contribute to promoting stable growth in the medium to long term by addressing asset imbalances, which had widened during the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the member noted that, although Korea’s fiscal soundness is much more favorable than that of major countries, fiscal expenditure is likely to make far less contribution than before to growth, due mainly to the plan to lower the rate of growth in fiscal expenditure in this year’s budget and to the frontloading of budget spending during the first quarter of 2016.
He went on to express the view that, with regard to steady rising overseas investment, it was essential to evaluate in detail the future influence of overseas corporate investment on the dynamism of domestic demand, and that attention should be paid to the declining share of fixed-rate lending in overall household debt.
In addition, the member stressed the need for paying attention to the possibility that these financial easing conditions could work to build up the risk of financial imbalances, as could be seen in the recent growth in credit related to real estate and the run-up in real estate prices in some parts of the Seoul Metropolitan region.
Looking at financial conditions, the member evaluated that volatility had increased considerably, as market interest rates were rising significantly on changes in expectations for monetary policy at home and abroad and stock prices had been sensitive to changes in the international political landscape.
The member diagnosed that the downward revision of the growth path was mainly because the growth trend in the first quarter had been lower than original projection, due to mounting uncertainties about external conditions, including the financial and economic instability in China.
The member added that exports continued to grow based on favorable external demand, and employment was approaching the pre-pandemic level thanks to a steady increase in the number of persons employed.
The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries and by geopolitical risks.
One other member set out the view that it would be desirable to carefully examine and analyze both the background and future trend of major variables critical to the growth and stability of the Korean economy, while holding the Base Rate at the current level for the intermeeting period.
Finally, in the domestic financial markets, members assessed that stock prices and long-term interest rates had fallen due to strengthened risk aversion stemming from the spread of COVID-19, and stressed that it was necessary to pay attention to the possibility of greater volatility.
Some members appraised the domestic financial markets as having stabilized overall, with stock prices rising sharply and the exchange rate falling, while geopolitical risks had gradually eased after their increase following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea.
Long-term market interest rates had risen, but have since declined.
The member noted that the output gap was close to zero and consumer price inflation was nearing 2 percent, which suggested a heightened need for narrowing the degree of monetary easing.
He went on to express the view that these upward trends should be monitored closely going forward.
The member mentioned that, led by the buoyancy of the IT sector, exports and facilities investment would likely contribute significantly to Korea’s economic growth, and this trend was expected to continue next year.
The member emphasized that, particularly since various indicators were showing that there was ample liquidity in domestic financial markets, policy efforts to induce capital flows into productive sectors had become more important.
The member observed that the combination of short-term factors, such as the prospect of prolonged tightening monetary policy stances in major countries and continued high interest rates, and structural factors, such as the decline in international investment and in supply chain efficiency resulting from geopolitical conflict, excessive debt, demographic shifts, and climate change, may cause economic players to be pessimistic about the future outlook, suppressing private consumption and investment for some time.
Furthermore, the member evaluated consumption as having shown gradual improvement if the effects of the slowdown in automobile sales resulting from the termination of individual consumption tax cuts in June were excluded.
The member noted that vigilance was needed most of all against the fact that COVID-19, the main cause of the current global economic slump, was likely to abate later than originally forecast.
Meanwhile, the member noted that labor market conditions were partially improving, with the number of persons employed shifting to an increase in March, but had not reached pre-pandemic levels.
the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat.
Considering the matters mentioned above, the member found the current macroeconomic policy mix and stance to be appropriate.
The member’s evaluation was that the won’s depreciation reflected mainly changes in the macroeconomic conditions at home and abroad and was not serious enough to raise concerns about a fall in Korea’s international credit standing.
The member also stressed the need for decisive and principled restructuring and for close cooperation with the relevant authorities concerning decisive household debt measures.
The member noted that, despite a possible virtuous circle of stock or housing price increases leading to real economic growth through the wealth effect, if the gap between the asset markets and the real economy widened too much or asset price increases triggered household debt, this could increase financial vulnerabilities and limit the medium- to long-term growth path.
However, uncertainties over the pace of future growth increased with growing concerns about an economic recession in the U.S.
Employment conditions have been somewhat sluggish, with the number of persons employed having continued to decline in the manufacturing sector while its trend of increase in the service sector has slowed as well.
Finally, in terms of financial stability, the member assessed that growth in household lending and housing prices had slowed since the second half of last year, but continued caution about the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances was required.
They forecast that the economic recovery would be maintained, driven largely by the economic recovery centered around advanced countries, and the restoration of consumer and investor confidence.
Long-term market interest rates have rebounded slightly, after having declined.
The improvements in the euro area, although weak, have continued, and the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate growth.
One member pointed out the possibility of a future slowdown of economic growth in emerging economies influenced by the delayed recoveries in advanced economies and persistence of international financial market unrest.
the pace of decline in inflation to be modest in the coming months, given stubbornly high inflation expectations, although factors such as declines in agricultural product prices and the base effect from last year will work to bring inflation down.
The member noted that consumer price inflation had decelerated in-line with the forecast, and expected it to reach the target level in the second half of to increases in oil prices and the exchange rate.
First, looking at the recent macroeconomic trends, there seemed no significant changes in the upside and downside risks to growth and inflation since the April MPB meeting.
One member however forecast that Korea’s growth rate would not deviate greatly from its long-term trend level, unless a situation such as during the 2008 global financial crisis recurred.
Regarding the future outlook, many members anticipated that the domestic economy would remain on an upward track on the back of export buoyancy, notwithstanding latent external risk factors.
The member mentioned that, given the role of Chinese manufacturing industries in the global supply chain and global trade flows, and the amount of local production by major Korean enterprises, production setbacks in China caused by the COVID-19 outbreak were direct and indirect risk factors for the domestic economy.
The member, however, commented that economic agents seemed to have responded somewhat excessively given the coexistence of upside risks, such as fiscal expansion to support job creation and income, government policy measures including a cut in the individual consumption tax, and major large corporations’ plans to expand their investment.
The member noted that the trade account had recorded a surplus for four months in a row since June, led by an increase in exports of automobiles and vessels and a decline in energy imports.
The member noted that the decoupling between the real economy and asset prices was a global phenomenon stemming from the exogenous shock of COVID-19 and from accommodative monetary policy, but the degree of decoupling was higher in Korea, due mainly to a housing policy factor and the skewed recovery of the real economy.
Most members expressed concerns about issues such as the contractions in consumer and investor confidence and the weakening of consumption due to structural factors, while some noted the possibility of a further delay in the economic recovery going forward.
Considering these factors, he expressed the opinion that it would be best to maintain the Base Rate at its present level for the intermeeting period.
The member also assessed that returns from inefficient leveraged investment had not led to sustainable revenues, which had been gradually increasing deadweight loss in the Korean economy.
The member specifically noted that the materialization of recovery in the semiconductor industry this year was expected to have positive impacts on the momentum for improvement in exports and facilities investment.
The member emphasized that attention should be paid to the possibility that price variable volatility would rise again and household and corporate credit risks would increase in the event of a delay in economic recovery due to prolongation of the pandemic.
Some pointed out the possibility that maintaining the Base Rate at its current level, to which it had been steeply cut to counteract the crisis, might give rise to serious side effects such as herd behavior in the markets, adding that if this should undermine market confidence in the monetary authorities, they would have to shoulder a very heavy cost burden.
The member noted that, although the effects of monetary policy seemed to have weakened compared to those in the past, effects from both fiscal and monetary macroeconomic policy still clearly existed.
increases in prices of industrial products, and core inflation rose compared to the previous month as well.
Many members forecast that, although inflation would remain stable for the time being as demand-side pressures were weak, it would rise gradually from the latter half of 2013, influenced for instance by an increase in the prices of agricultural and marine products and by a base effect.
The member stated that investment was undergoing a correction phase, but exports and consumption remained strong.
The member took the view that, given pent-up service demand since the outbreak of the pandemic and growth in surplus saving so far, there was an underlying trend of recovery in solid consumption demand.
- Consumer price inflation registered 0.8% in June, the same as in May, in line mainly with declines in agricultural product prices.
The member took the view that, although a supplementary budget that the government had been working on would make up for the sluggishness of the domestic economy to a certain extent, the domestic economy would not be able to avoid the effects of the global economic slowdown.
One other member pointed out the need to examine the effectiveness and capacity of fiscal policy, which along with monetary policy forms the two main pillars of macroeconomic policy.
Taking these domestic and overseas developments into consideration, the member cited the following as the major reasons for the judgment that the Base Rate should be kept unchanged.
The member’s evaluation was that the economy had been expected to slow this year, due largely to the negative effects of declining semiconductor prices, but the –0.34% GDP growth rate during the first quarter had been worse than expected.
The member went on to note that any delay in changing the Base Rate, on the other hand, would lead to accumulated economic and social losses stemming from increased idle resources.
The member thus expressed the need to pay attention to this point.
The member raised concerns that most of the growth improvement since the second quarter had come from the US.
The member also noted that the Korean won to the U.S. dollar exchange rate had risen considerably, due to expectations for a prolonged tightening stance at the U.S. Fed and to the strong dollar.
The member commented that the price and growth trends and financial stability conditions would be considered together in a balanced manner in Base Rate rate operations going forward.
today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period.
One member meanwhile expressed the view that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 1.50 percent for the intermeeting period.
has continued, as exports have sustained their high rate of increase and consumption has recovered moderately although investment has temporarily slowed.
Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.50% for the intermeeting period.
The member judged that the economic growth rate for this year seemed to have declined somewhat rapidly due to the base effect from excessive construction investment over the past few years and the readjustment of IT-related facilities investment that had shown fast growth last year, but recorded growth was within the margin of error of the forecast path and at the level of the potential growth rate, which itself had remained on a downward path.
In this regard, the member evaluated that more time should be taken to monitor movements of macroeconomic indicators while holding the Base Rate at its current level.
The member also presented the opinion that, if the rate differentials between Korea and the US widened further than expected due to any further rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, there could be possibility of heavier depreciation pressure on the won, which could act as a negative factor on domestic prices and growth.
The slack in the labor force, meanwhile, had increased for the third consecutive month in June, with growth in the unemployment and time gaps more than offsetting the lack of substantial changes in the participation gap.
The Bank of Korea forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due for example to a shift in the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries.
The member forecast that domestic economic growth would be dampened significantly by COVID-19, with production and retail sales declining and facilities investment delayed.
Members also judged that, in the international markets, the US dollar had strengthened, interest rates had generally declined, and stock prices had risen centering around advanced countries.
rates rose, due mostly to international financial market stability and improvements in economic indicators in major countries, and the Korean won appreciated against the US dollar owing chiefly to the continued surplus in the current account.
On the other hand, the member added that core inflation was only in the lower-1 percent range due to sluggishness in administered items, leasehold deposits, monthly rental payments, and industrial products.
The member thus assessed that the possibility could not be ruled out that consumer price inflation would exceed the target for a longer period of time than the Research Department’s current projection.
The member assessed that the output gap seemed to have turned slightly positive but, considering that inflationary pressures were not yet large, it would be necessary to keep the current monetary easing stance for the time being, and went on to state that now seemed the time to closely monitor the real economic trend since the previous Base Rate hike and to analyze whether the current economic recovery would be sustainable in the medium and long term.
One member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current 3.50% at this meeting.
The member saw that goods prices which had led low inflation since 2013 had rebounded last year, influenced by rising oil prices and supply disruptions, to record 4.5% growth in the fourth quarter, and would likely maintain high growth this year as well under the influence of a rise in the won-dollar exchange rate.
Regarding the current account, the member mentioned that the trade account deficit was worrisome, but considering its dependence on energy imports, Korea’s current account to GDP ratio was more favorable than those of major countries and Korea’s ratio of the current account to GDP excluding energy was even higher than those of major countries.
In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability such as household debt growth, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic.
Second, the member stated that it would be necessary to keep a close watch on how that day’s Fed rate hike and policy rate projections by the FOMC meeting participants would affect international financial markets and domestic financial and foreign exchange markets.
He pointed out that some new external factors making for uncertainty were emerging, however, including the intensification of disputes among countries over exchange rates and signs of a renewed run-up in global grain prices.
The member pointed out that, in the credit and securities markets, credit spreads had narrowed considerably, and anxiety in the PF-ABCP market had eased somewhat.
The member saw that risk aversion in the financial markets had eased somewhat, thanks to recent active policy responses by individual countries, but the shock to the real economy was increasing further, due to the implementation of strong quarantine measures, such as lockdowns or business suspensions in major countries, including the US.
The member voiced concern that changes in the domestic and international economic environments had been worsening further since the last MPB meeting.
As for housing prices, one member appraised those in Seoul and its surrounding areas as having continued their fall, as in the previous month, while the pace of their increase in the rest of the country had slowed, due chiefly to burdens stemming from their previous rapid surge.
The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of recovery going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year higher than the April projection (2.6%).
The member added that retail sales and construction investment were improving, facilities investment was sustaining a strong recovery, and export growth was increasing.
Another member judged that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate at its current level of 0.75%.
One other member argued that, although the growth path was judged to have been adjusted slightly downward in comparison with the October the fourth quarter of 2015, and to downward adjustments to the rates of growth of the world economy and global trade, and the price path was judged to have been adjusted substantially downward, as a further decline in international oil prices of late had acted as a downward pressure, these downward adjustments to the paths of growth and prices were mainly attributable to unforeseen changes in external factors, and the Base Rate’s current level still seemed accommodative, even in light of the downwardly adjusted outlook.
Meanwhile, another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level.
The member judged that, although the Base Rate had been already lowered to the still had room for a further rate cut considering the level of the policy rates of major countries.
The member took the view that this was attributable substantially to base-period effects and government support measures, but the trickle-down effects of wide-ranging export strength and the wealth effects of asset price rises were also responsible.
Members, however, diagnosed uncertainties surrounding the outlook for recovery as remaining high, as the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 or a protracted pandemic had increased.
With regard to prices, the member noted that, amid ongoing pressure on the demand side, pressure on the supply side, including oil prices, exchange rates and wages, had increased further, and, as a result, consumer price inflation stood at 6.0% in June, the highest level since 1998.
One member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from the current level of 0.50%.
in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to increases in petroleum product prices.
The member meanwhile assessed that, when making a simple comparison among major OECD countries with respect to the combined effects on GDP growth of fiscal stimulus for this year and of recent policy rate changes, Korea was implementing the most expansionary macroeconomic policy.
First of all, the member forecast that underlying inflation would bottom out in the first quarter of this year and rebound afterwards.
Lastly, emphasizing the need for an approach to the causes of the slow growth that accorded with a focus on the structural contraction of private consumption rather than attributing it solely to the sluggish global economy, another member suggested it was necessary to ascertain whether the critical point had now been reached beyond which the recovery of private consumption would be held back for a long time by the influence of household debt.
The member judged that overall financial conditions remained stable, with flows of corporate credit gradually recovering and with economic activity improving.
The member, however, pointed out that leverage in the private sector continued to increase, with household lending sustaining strong growth led by accommodative financial conditions, and went on to argue that attention should be paid to the possibility that this could heighten medium- and long-term financial vulnerability and negatively affect the efficiency of resource allocation.
consumption has contracted due to the recent coronavirus resurgence, facilities investment has continued to recover and export growth has increased, led by the IT sector.
Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile moved within a narrow range.
Prior to the members' discussion regarding the Base Rate, the Chairman gave the floor to the 1st Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance, who explained the government's assessment of the current economic situation and the measures to stabilize prices of items closely connected with the lives of the general public, and then left the meeting.
Concerning the domestic economy, members’ evaluation was that it was continuing to grow at its potential level with the steady growth of private consumption and exports, although facilities and construction investment had been going through corrections.
Looking at financial stability, the member assessed the exchange rate and capital flows as showing limited volatility thanks to improved external soundness, although stock market volatility had expanded due to a likely early tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The member judged that overall growth had been fluctuating in accordance with the degree of the growth contribution of the government sector, with growth in the private sector being almost at a standstill since the fourth quarter of last year.
The member projected that, while the domestic economy would maintain a slowing trend for some time, it would gradually recover in the second half of this year.
The US dollar has remained strong and stock prices have fallen considerably, while government bond yields in major countries have fluctuated significantly.
The member noted that financial unrest could spread, as seen in unrest in the asset-backed securities market and the shrinkage of the credit bond market, as a slowdown in the real estate market and the weakening of investor sentiment would continue for some time.
The member thus raised the concern that reversals of elements that had all moved in only one direction during the pandemic, such as expansionary fiscal policy based on government bond issuance at low rates, rising asset market prices based on leveraged investment, and expansions in household and corporate debt, could trigger unforseen shocks.
Regarding international financial markets, the member noted that major price variables fluctuated substantially, influenced largely by changing expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and political uncertainties in the U.S. and Europe.
The member added that the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate had risen significantly and then had fallen back, influenced by global movements of the US dollar.
The member expected inflation to exceed the path projected in November for a considerable time, given the ongoing sharp rise in international commodity prices, the prolongation of global supply disruptions, and the growing upward pressures on the domestic demand side.
Another member expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to keep the Base Rate at its current level for the intermeeting period because, if the changes in the domestic and international financial and economic situation over the previous month were looked at comprehensively, economic activity and consumer prices were judged to have not strayed far from the path forecast in April, and considering the uncertainties surrounding domestic and foreign economic movements and the possibility of heightened international financial market volatility, there was a need to secure room for future monetary policy maneuver.
Concerning FX swap and FX market stability, meanwhile, the member’s assessment was that overall market conditions had remained normal and stable, with capital flows and prices reflecting real economic conditions, while the sustained geopolitical risk and the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike stance had only limited effects on the flows of global investment funds into Korea and related price variables.
Members shared the view that the corporate and household sectors were in good shape overall financially, but raised concerns about a possible rise in delinquency rates in some industries including the sluggish construction industry.
- Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability.
One other member argued that downside risks to the future growth and price paths were high, taking into account that although economic activity was expected to follow the path forecast in July, downside risks to the growth path for the second half had increased due to a prolonged slump in exports and the manufacturing industry, and considering that although consumer price inflation was judged to be falling somewhat short of the path forecast in July due mainly to the decline in international oil prices, core inflation was holding to the original forecast path, and keeping in mind that the slack in the production sector and the overall spare capacity in the labor market had expanded somewhat.
Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices diminish.
One member was of the opinion that the Bank of Korea should on the one hand work to constantly refine its monetary policy instruments, by examining the side-effects arising from the prolongation of low interest rates, the controversies related to the stimulative effect of Base Rate adjustment and the effectiveness of the recently reorganized Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loan, while on the other hand also strengthen its efforts, as the central bank, to put forward policy alternatives for the sound development of the Korean economy in view of the heightened concerns over entrenchment of a trend of low growth caused by the recent delay in economic recovery.
Particularly, one member mentioned the possibility of a double dip recession, in line with the growing downside risks arising from sluggish employment conditions and a slowdown in the housing market.
As to the domestic economy, many members commented that, although production indicators had shown partial improvements, the recovery of domestic demand as evident from consumption and facilities investment appeared feeble, while indicators of economic agents’ sentiment had deteriorated.
The member also argued that, despite the overall recovery in global goods demand, supply chain bottlenecks were unlikely to be resolved any time soon.
One of these members, however, put forward the opinion that the possibility needed to be borne in mind of factors such as the still high expected inflation and the unstable international grain prices working to destabilize prices.
The member noted that, despite the substantial increase in the government’s transfer payments, the decline in household consumption growth has not been eased.
On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued its substantial uptrend, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector.
Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be somewhat below the path projected in July, but to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level.
Although Korea does not have large trade volumes with Russia and Ukraine, negative supply shocks might be seen through higher commodity prices, and negative demand shocks via an indirect route through for instance the EU.
Meanwhile, one member mentioned that real estate prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas while their uptrend in the rest of the country was subsiding to some degree, and that their pace would slow further in the coming months—mostly on the weakening economic recovery and the expansion in supply of apartments, particularly small and medium-sized units.
On the employment front, as the number of persons employed increased in September, the employment-to-population ratio rose compared to that in September of last year while the unemployment rate maintained the same level.
The member added that, as IT-related investment, in particular, would cause job quality in sectors other than capital-intensive new industries to continue to decline, average wages would decrease further, thus possibly leading to a reduction in the share of labor income over the medium term.
Concerning domestic inflation, the member argued that consumer price inflation had declined substantially due to the base-period effect of petroleum prices, but that the decline was slower than originally expected, with personal service prices sustaining strong growth.
The member, however, argued that, in this process, consumer price inflation would be likely to exhibit high volatility in monthly terms due mainly to a base-period effect, which could cause confusion in the formation of inflation expectations.
He also asserted that, to engineer a soft-landing of the household debt problem, the costs and benefits of various policy measures including a Base Rate hike must be reexamined, and ways for mitigating their side effects sought.
The member expected that, although private consumption had been recovering slowly, it would likely maintain a modest upward trajectory going forward, depending on future improvements in real household incomes.
Concerning inflation, the member mentioned that attention should be paid to the fact that core inflation with regulated prices excluded was projected at around 2% for the second half of this year and the first half of next year.
to recover despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.
The member commented that consumer price inflation had risen above the 2% inflation target, influenced by accelerating upward trends of oil prices and agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices.
previous month, owing primarily to the stability in prices of livestock products and industrial goods, and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at a low level at 1.2%.
First, further tightening could be considered necessary in order to stabilize inflation quickly at the target level, but the benefits seemed to be very small or uncertain considering the current policy and market rates.
In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth.
The Korean won has fluctuated within a narrow range, after having appreciated owing chiefly to the easing of financial unrest in emerging market countries.
Looking at domestic demand, the member expressed the opinion that retail sales were estimated not to have recovered from the decline seen since September and services production remained unchanged, together implying a slowdown in the recovery of private consumption.
The member also presented the view that maintaining the monetary tightening stance long enough would help facilitate the deleveraging of household debt that had increased excessively, and strengthen the long-term soundness of the Korean economy.
The Korean won has weakened slightly, as the influences of the continued current account surplus and the outflows of foreigners’ securities investment funds have overlapped.
Another member presented the view that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate steady at the current level of 3.50% for the inermeeting period.
The member then noted that, with such conditions making it difficult to be optimistic about the overall economy, underlying inflation was unlikely to converge toward the 2% target.
Members diagnosed that volatility in global financial markets had increased, with government bond yields and stock prices falling substantially in major countries.
The member evaluated that, looking at the major economic indicators released since the previous meeting, the average growth rate during the first half of this year would not deviate far from the April forecast, and added that the secular improvement in the output gap had continued.
As for other considerations with regard to inflation in future Base Rate decisions, the member mentioned the time lag with which rate hikes are transmitted, the speed of disinflation, and the economic situation for next year.
The member also noted that, to prevent excessive anxiety stemming from the recent heightened volatility in global financial markets, the Bank should assure economic agents that Korea’s capacity to respond to external shocks was relatively sound, thanks to its large current account surplus, abundant holdings of official foreign reserves, and banks’ safe external debt structures.
The member argued that the Korean economy had been overcoming the crisis relatively successfully based on strong goods exports, but it was now faced with a new challenge — increases in interest rates and inflation had caused the production costs of businesses to rise and household purchasing power to weaken compared with the pre-COVID-19 period.
Housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country rose at rates similar to those in December.
One other member expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged from the current level for the intermeeting period.
One member, however, stated that economic sentiment among the public had improved only slightly, owing to the modestness of the economic recovery and the persistently sluggish employment situation.
The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, but judges that for the time being inflationary pressures will not be high.
Regarding the financial markets, the member mentioned that, although household debt growth had slowed, credit to the corporate sector had maintained strong growth and liquidity growth remained at a high level.
Meanwhile, one other member noted that, although a look at changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad over the past one month showed that there had been no large changes in the price path, the growth path was judged to have been adjusted slightly downward, affected for instance by the MERS outbreak and sluggish exports.
The member emphasized that efforts to normalize funding costs and policy cooperation among the relevant authorities should be strengthened.
The member noted that there were growing concerns in the stock market about overly optimistic expectations from individual investors and leveraged speculative transactions.
He added that, with spending power having declined owing primarily to the growing household debt and the worsening of the income distribution structure, economic momentum might weaken rapidly if exports became less brisk in response to the world economic slowdown.
The member also explained that investment related to real estate, construction and IT, which had once led economic growth, had continued to undergo corrections, which had seemingly contributed to a fall in the domestic economic growth rate to a level near the downwardly adjusted potential growth rate.
remained at a weak level, with indicators related to exports and domestic demand alternating between improving and worsening.
Government bond yields in major countries have risen sharply and stock prices have fallen considerably.
On the domestic front, the member’s judgment was that, since sluggish domestic demand had not shown any sign of recovery, for the time being it would be difficult to expect any significant economic recovery beyond a technical rebound.
Next, the member emphasized the need to keep an eye on the negative effects of strong growth in private-sector credit amid the accommodative financial conditions.
As a result, most central banks in advanced economies began cutting rates or have signaled the possibility of doing so.
Members also mentioned that household debt was expected to stabilize, thanks for example to government measures, but its growth had continued to outpace that of household income, while sole proprietor loans had also maintained strong growth, all of which required constant attention.
The member emphasized once again that in the current situation in which the buildup of financial imbalances had expanded not only in Korea but also in most advanced economies due to the negative side effects of prolonged accommodative monetary policies, it was very important to rethink the dynamic trade-off mentioned above.
Notably, he expressed the view that it would also be necessary to monitor and develop measures in response to the increases in capital flows and sharp fluctuations in exchange rates that might be caused by the different timing of the unwinding of quantitative easing by major countries such as the US and Japan.
has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have sustained their high rate of increase.
The member nevertheless expressed support for a 50 basis point hike due to the strong need to respond to persistent high inflation and pursue financial and FX market stability.
The member added that this was because supply-side inflationary pressures had recently increased to a greater extent than expected due to rising oil prices and to the exchange rate, and, if the situation in the Middle East worsens, there was a significant risk of a further rise in oil prices and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar simultaneously.
rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices.
However, the member expected the degree of contraction in consumption this time would not be greater than those during the past waves, while exports and facilities investment in particular would continue their solid recoveries.
A number of members noted that housing transactions had become more active and the trends of increase in housing sales and leasehold deposit prices had accelerated, owing mainly to shifts from deposit-based tenancies to outright sales or monthly payment-based rentals, while bank household lending had sustained its trend of increase centering on the Bank of Korea website.
Moreover, the member added that reviewing the soundness of financial institutions would be necessary, considering that it had been almost two years since the policy rate hike stance began, and that the possibility of a tightening stance would continue for the time being.
such as interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates have widened, due mainly to the effects of external risk factors including the sovereign debt problems in Europe.
The member judged that, although the sharp rise in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate was largely attributable to the strong dollar in line with the US Federal Reserve’s strong tightening stance, and the domestic economy’s overall fundamentals such as official foreign reserves remained favorable, amplification of such instability could negatively affect domestic price and real economic trends.
In local financial markets, however, financial conditions have continuously eased, with falling short- and long-term interest rates and a stock price rally.
To stabilize prices of essential goods, crucial for low-income households, more structural and fundamental policies are needed.
The member mentioned that inflation expectations of economic agents had grown rapidly amid the recent sustained uptrend in prices.
The member saw that employment remained favorable overall, although growth in the number of persons employed was gradually slowing.
Mr. Woosik Moon, however, dissented, expressing his clear opposition to lowering the Base Rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, and arguing for keeping it at the existing level.
Members assessed that, despite a recovery in private consumption, driven by face-to-face service consumption and ongoing favorable labor conditions, domestic economic growth was slowing due mainly to sluggish investment as well as slowing export growth stemming from a weakening of economic growth in major countries.
The member was also concerned that core inflation was running within the 0% range and the trend of decline in inflation expectations was continuing.
The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, reflecting the global strengthening of the US dollar.
economy has strengthened, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries.
The member added that despite the decline in goods prices, supercore inflation and housing services inflation had remained elevated, pushing back the expected timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pivot to beyond the mid-year.
The same member then expressed the view that, considering the time lag before the effects of the August Base Rate cut materialized, and the possibility of an increase in household debt risk, it was necessary to maintain the Base Rate at its current level for the month, and to keep a close watch on the future movements of economic indicators.
He opined as well that, since household debt and savings were two sides of the same coin, it was necessary to adopt a balanced stance on interest rate policy, taking both financial debt and savings into consideration.
First, the Base Rate hikes delivered so far have already begun to have an effect on the real economy, and the current level of the Rate was fairly tight, given the likelihood of the economy slowing further than the earlier forecast.
The member also expected that core inflation excluding administered prices would also come in at the upper-1% level, and estimated that core inflation felt by the general public would be higher when taking into account the recent sharp rise in owners’ equivalent rent that is excluded from the consumer price statistics.
The member’s assessment was that the 1.25% nominal level of the Base Rate could not be assessed to be low under recent macroeconomic conditions with the inflation falling to a historically low level, and that the real interest rate with underlying price inflation excluded remained the highest among major advanced countries.
The member added that growth in leasehold deposit loans, which are guaranteed loans, seemed to have been boosted by the increased guarantees provided by guarantee institutions seeking housing stability for the general public, and in this regard, curbing household debt would require policy instruments aiming at adjusting the degree of growth in leasehold deposit loans.
In addition, most members judged that, with destabilizing external factors including the sovereign debt problems in the euro area and economic sluggishness in major countries persisting for a long time, the timing of GDP growth rate’s return to trend was very likely to be delayed longer than expected.
The member judged that, taking these points into overall consideration, it would be appropriate to raise the Base Rate to 0.75% from 0.50%.
The member also found it desirable to keep a close watch on whether the foundation for economic recovery would spread to domestic demand, leading to further inflationary pressures, while examining whether risk related to household debt, which had increased sharply in line with the boom in the real estate market, would gradually diminish.
The member forecast that, despite uncertainties related to developments of the Omicron variant and global inflation, and related policy measures, the global economy would maintain a recovery, as seen in the strong growth of world trade.
The member commented that consumer price inflation had recently rebounded owing to rises in agricultural prices and global oil prices.
The member stressed that it was difficult to respond to irregular exchange rate fluctuations in a consistent manner by adjusting the Base Rate and that, unless faced with a critical situation such as sudden capital outflows and a fall in Korea’s international credit standing, priority consideration should be given to the domestic economy, inflation and financial stability conditions.
The member also noted that, regarding employment conditions, there was an upward trend in the number of employed women and of those aged 60 and older, driven by the services sector.
As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be slow and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.
The member expected that consumption would continue to slow, weighed down by an economic slowdown, declining real purchasing power, and the growing burden of loan principal and interest repayment, in addition to the decrease in consumption capacity.
As to export and import trends, the 1st Vice Minister remarked that exports had shown slower growth in October, due chiefly to the base effect and to decreased exports to the US and the EU in line with the global fiscal crisis, while imports had fallen from the preceding month owing largely to the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar and the decline in international commodity prices.
As for the global financial markets, members mentioned that the volatility of stock prices and exchange rates in the US and other advanced economies (AEs) had increased, but the financial unrest in some emerging market economies (EMEs) had eased.
About financial markets, the member commented that despite the rise in market interest rates driven by weakened expectations for the U.S. Fed’s early rate cuts, market sentiments had generally remained stable, but that the potential risk associated with real estate project financing was still high, with home mortgage loans and corporate loans continuing to soar.
While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the correction in construction investment has continued.
to sharp rises in the prices of some agricultural and livestock products.
Taking into account factors such as the sustained high growth in household and corporate loans, the member found it desirable to maintain a tightening monetary policy stance going forward.
Long-term market interest rates have fallen back, after having risen in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries and to domestic economic indicators.
Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries.
The member projected meanwhile that a majority of major countries had been adjusting their monetary easing stances to tackle inflation and, in this process, financial conditions in Korea would continue to be affected by increasing global financial market volatility.
The member, however, noted that, the recent slowbalization was heightening concern that economic prosperity backed by expanded international trade and market opening could be reversed.
The member projected that the domestic economy would likely continue to show gradual improvement, led by exports.
On the domestic economy, the member saw that exports, led by semiconductors, had recovered strongly and were driving growth.
Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 0.50% for the intermeeting period.
Concerning some negative forecasts for major industries, the member stressed that the structural problems of those industries should be reviewed to expand their mid- to long-term growth potentials.
The member stated that the 3-year Treasury yield had risen significantly in a short period of time and banks’ household lending rates had become much higher than during the pre-COVID-19 period, and went on to express concerns that this could work to increase debt-servicing burdens and funding costs, ultimately limiting the real economic recovery.
European countries, on the other hand, have been simultaneously experiencing both declining inflation and sluggish growth due to a stagnation in labor productivity resulting from the sluggish manufacturing sector and to a delay in any recovery in demand.
The member noted that the world economy was sustaining its moderate pace of growth, and the impacts of impending US rate hikes on the international financial markets and the foreign exchange market in Korea were likely to be limited.
The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as pressures to hike public utility fees and the ongoing high inflation expectations.
The member’s diagnosis, however, was that uncertainties surrounding the future growth path remained high, owing to the uncertainty of pandemic-related developments and to the signs of a reescalation of US-China trade tensions.
The member presented the opinion that, particularly since consumer price inflation had run in the 0% range for two years in a row and the trend of recovery in consumption was expected to be delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19, present conditions did not give rise to concerns about upward inflationary pressures over a medium-term horizon.
Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will fall considerably short of the 2% inflation target for the time being, due mainly to the low oil prices.
The member thus expressed the view that it was desirable to keep the Base Rate unchanged at the current 1.25% level.
The member commented that this showed that low inflationary pressures on the demand side were a major cause of the low inflation.
Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.25% to 3.50%.
The member evaluated that the reflation trend in the world economy was gradually spreading, as the international financial market and emerging market economies remained stable.
Toward the fourth quarter of this year, however, inflation was expected to decline slightly to around the target level, with the base-period effects from temporary supply shocks and regulations fading away.
The member noted that, driven by the recovery in domestic demand, combined with supply-side factors including a surge in energy prices and supply chain disruptions, upward pressures on inflation had increased more than originally expected, and core inflation also stood at the mid-2% level, with inflationary pressure expanding into core items such as personal services and durables.
Another member presented the view that it would be desirable to hold the Base Rate at its current level.
The member also took the view that advanced countries had experienced a sharp drop in the propensity to consume at around retirement age, and the fact that the baby boomer generation, which accounts for a substantial share of households in Korea, was approaching retirement could be a factor causing household consumption to contract.
Third, amid the recent positive external conditions, including the boom in the IT industry, it would be desirable to ensure macroeconomic policy space and promote medium-term growth, rather than adopting short-sighted approaches such as expanding investment and boosting consumption.
The members stressed that, despite a slowdown in household debt growth, it would be necessary to constantly examine growth in loans such as leasehold deposit loans and loans to sole proprietors.
Another member assessed the financial and foreign exchange sectors to be very sound, with the external debt profile and the foreign currency situation greatly improved compared to past financial crises, and the capacity to withstand rapid capital outflows thus heightened.
The member went on to point out, however, that the recent housing market movements had not been serious enough to raise concerns in terms of monetary policy.
Volatility in global financial markets has increased.
The member noted that the domestic financial market was maintaining a relatively stable situation with volatility in price variables declining and credit spreads falling slightly.
recoveries in major advanced economies to have exhibited signs of being somewhat delayed, while emerging market economies continue to show favorable performances.
The member saw that such shocks would likely have only limited impacts on growth during the course of world economic recovery, but expected the extent and duration of global inflation to increase further, due to rising international commodity prices and worsening global supply chain disruptions.
The member, meanwhile, added that a shock to capital flows stemming from an inversion of the US and Korean policy rates would likely be absorbed smoothly through flexible exchange rate adjustments based on Korea’s favorable external soundness, including current account surplus and ample foreign reserves, accumulated for about last 20 years.
The member added that the Chinese economy had been in a structural decline, particularly in the real estate sector.
However, the member noted that, despite the unprecedentedly low Base Rate, mortgage lending rates had already risen above the pre-pandemic level, and the housing transaction volume and new lending related to housing sales had been gradually declining of late.
Members also evaluated that, with respect to the global financial markets, with major advanced countries adopting diverging monetary policy stances, global financial market volatility had been increasing due to concerns about an escalation of the US-China trade dispute, and that attention needed to be paid to the possibility of tougher financial market conditions in line with the rising cost of raising dollars in the short term.
One member assessed that, although domestic foreign exchange market volatility had risen considerably over the previous three months, it was markedly improved compared to the time of the global financial crisis in 2008, and attributed this mostly to the strengthened fundamentals of the Korean economy, to the improved external debt profile, and to the expanded sizes of Korea’s currency swap arrangements with Japan and China.
The member took the view that it would be necessary in this regard to adjust the degree of monetary easing and change the policy stance to meet changing financial and economic conditions.
After briefings by staff on 'Current Economic Developments in Korea', of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members covered the following areas: With regard to the global economy, members’ assessment was that the trend of economic recovery had continued led by the US, the euro area, Japan and other advanced countries, and that the Chinese economy was also maintaining its solidly-based growth.
The member projected that GDP growth for this year would be similar to the previous forecast, but the economic slowdown was likely to deepen somewhat next year.
With regard to construction investment, the member’s assessment was that its growth rate had peaked but that it would increase slowly until next year.
One member, meanwhile, expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to hold the Base Rate at its current level of 1.25 percent for the intermeeting period.
In addition, the member noted that, with the Base Rate below the neutral interest rate, the tightening of financial conditions following a rise in long-term interest rates was not yet at a concerning level, and that long-term interest rates, having been lowered excessively due chiefly to the effects of advanced countries’ quantitative easing, had been normalized to some extent, which would have the positive effects of curbing the exposure of the financial system to real estate risks and the risk of further debt leveraging.
The member pointed out that, although this suggested that monetary policy transmission channels are working smoothly in the financial markets, continued attention should be paid to the possibility of the accumulation of financial imbalances that could be brought about by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions.
rates have fallen and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar, influenced mainly by external risk factors.
The contrasting effects of external and internal demand are offsetting each other, leading to overall economic growth that does not significantly deviate from previous forecasts.
As to prices, members noted that consumer price inflation had exceeded its target of 2 percent during the first quarter, influenced by strong growth in the prices of oil and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.
Concerning the financial markets, the member pointed out that risk preferences had been weakening somewhat, with interest rates rising substantially and stock prices falling on the back of strengthening expectations of policy rate hikes at home and abroad, while M2 growth had accelerated led by the expansion in private-sector credit supply.
However, the member mentioned that two conditions have to be met first if there is to be a rate cut.
The member, however, stressed the need to recognize that it takes quite a long time for an economy to recover in the event of an unusually large economic shock.
The member commented that in FX markets, the Korean won to U.S. dollar exchange rate had remained high with its volatility expanded.
Third, the member evaluated that, despite the three Base Rate hikes since August last year, monetary policy still remained accommodative.
factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded.
The member noted that financial conditions did not appear to be greatly constrained given that M2 growth remained high at the 8% level.
