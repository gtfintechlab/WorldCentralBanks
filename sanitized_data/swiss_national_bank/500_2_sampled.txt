Owing to the economic growth, the labour market situation in advanced economies has improved in recent quarters
In the wake of this development, capacity utilisation in the economy as a whole increased further
Overall, the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued, despite a slight depreciation
The applicable interest rate on sight deposits is available at , Statistics, Reports and press releases, Interest rates and foreign exchange rates _current
The SNB is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75
The economic signals for the coming months remain favourable
This would have a dampening effect on the economy as well as on prices
According to the SNBs assessment, imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets persist
It is thus just within the range of price stability at the end of the forecast horizon
Interest rates were last lowered on 6 March of this year
The rapid deterioration in the economic situation and the decline in commodity prices have also led to a clear downward revision of the inflation forecast
In addition, because of strong demand, higher production costs could be passed on to prices more easily
For 2016 as a whole, it still anticipates real GDP growth of between 1 and 1.5
The Swiss economy continued to grow at a moderate rate in the second quarter
The lower oil and gas prices and the stronger Swiss franc are having a dampening effect over the short term
In its baseline scenario for global economic developments, the SNB anticipates solid growth in the coming quarters
This inflation forecast involves particular uncertainties
Growth was curbed in part by temporary factors
The new forecast stands at 2.1 for 2022, and 0.9 for 2023 and 2024 cf
International trade tensions and political uncertainty have weighed on the global economy in recent months
The positive development in the first half of the year was, however, partly due to special factors
Consequently, the SNB welcomes the Federal Council decision to make available a countercyclical capital buffer which can counter adverse developments on the domestic credit market
Its current assumptions are based on growth rates that are slightly higher than those foreseen in June
This slowdown is on the one hand attributable to the high level of inflation, which is weighing on purchasing power and thus reducing demand
Survey-based labour demand indicators have recovered further
Should the economy deteriorate more severely than expected, there would be a risk of negative inflation
Orders received and the order backlog in industry still fall short of the desired level, and demand for export goods continues to be modest
The survey carried out in January 2009 shows that some banks have tightened their lending conditions slightly
At the same time, the moderate pace of global growth should continue
Consequently, corporate bond conditions on the capital markets have become attractive
The SNB currently expects growth of around 1.5 for 2025
This is a reflection of the fact that the assessment of the inflation outlook has not changed significantly compared to the previous quarter
Both led to lower expectations regarding policy rates in the major currency areas
Despite the interest rate lift, monetary policy remains expansionary and supports the upswing
It is therefore keeping a close watch on this sector
As a result of the stronger growth momentum in the US and the emerging economies, the SNB revised its global growth assumptions upwards for 2011
In doing so, it is countering the renewed rise in inflationary pressure and the spread of inflation to goods and services that have so far been less affected
Moreover, public spending will play a countercyclical role
The National Bank considers the new interest rate level to be appropriate to ensure price stability in the medium term and to allow balanced economic growth
The increase in activity had a favourable impact on the labour market
Further cuts in the SNB policy rate may become necessary in the coming quarters to ensure price stability over the medium term
Notably, inflation in the private service sector has receded
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing pressure on the currency
For the time being, it intends to keep the three-month Libor rate in the middle of the target range at 0.75
A further escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis cannot be ruled out
Despite restrained momentum in recent quarters, imbalances on the mortgage and real estate market increased slightly due to comparatively weak growth in fundamentals
In the advanced economies, expansionary monetary policy and the robust situation on the labour market are lending support, as is fiscal policy in some countries
Over the medium term, however, it should return to more moderate levels, not least thanks to monetary policy and due to the economic slowdown
Particularly strong advances were recorded by retail and wholesale trade, the financial industry and construction
Global economic growth continued in the second quarter in line with the SNBs expectations
For 2020, the SNB expects inflation of 1.0, compared with its previous forecast of 1.2
In the second quarter of 2020, gross domestic product GDP was approximately 1020 below its end-2019 level in most countries
The economic recovery in Switzerland expected for 2003 may be delayed
The price of oil has risen again
The increased weight of fluctuating oil prices and the inclusion of clearance sales prices in the new national consumer price index tend to render inflation more volatile from one month to another
The resulting climate of uncertainty will prompt households to exercise more caution and will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending
However, if the uncertainty in the financial markets persists, it is conceivable that the momentum from abroad and the growth contribution from the domestic financial sector could be reduced
During the course of 2009, the new forecast drops below the previous one again
The National Bank is watching the expansion of liquidity carefully
Growth in Switzerland was robust in the third quarter of 2010, but the weakening of exports, in particular, points to a significant reduction in growth in the quarters ahead
There is no indication that price stability might be jeopardised in the medium term
However, following strong growth in the previous quarters, the pace is expected to slow slightly
The SNB inflation forecast maps the future development of prices on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged over the forecasting period
For this year, the National Bank continues to anticipate GDP growth to be close to 2
In essence, the reason why the forecast follows this path is because of past movements in oil prices baseline effects
Above all, the appreciably lower oil price will push inflation into negative territory during the next four quarters
The M3 aggregate, which was still increasing at a moderate rate at our last assessment in June, has begun to advance more rapidly
However, although the growth in the US in the past few months has been surprisingly positive, economic performance has been disappointing in Europe
Against expectations, the low energy prices have had only a limited stimulatory effect on household consumer spending
In order to counter any insecurity in the financial markets the National Bank carried out its assessment today, ahead of the planned date of 20 September 2001
However, at present there is considerable uncertainty with regard to assessment of the inflation outlook
Once again, growth in mortgage lending has slowed and currently stands at 3.8
More information on the calculation of the exemption threshold can be found in the attached instruction sheet
The latest developments in the international financial markets  mortgage crisis in the US, correction on stock markets, liquidity shortage on the money markets  have made it difficult to assess the international environment
Expenditure on equipment investment was cut significantly
The SNB still expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters
The National Bank still anticipates economic growth to be close to 2 in 2004
If the Swiss franc were to appreciate rapidly, the SNB would respond appropriately
There is a risk that tensions in the euro area will increase again
Annual inflation measured by the national consumer price index CPI increased from 0.4 in January to 1.1 in April
The new forecast is therefore slightly below that of December from 2011 onwards
Recent indicators show that this is again having a detrimental impact on economic activity
The new forecast puts average annual inflation at 2.6 for 2023, and 2.0 for 2024 and 2025 cf
However, inflation prospects have deteriorated slightly due to the good state of the economy, the continued high price of oil and the low level of the Swiss franc
This growth can be expected to persist, thanks to the healthy state of the Swiss economy
Production capacity will therefore remain underutilised for longer than previously assumed, and the recovery on the labour market is also likely to be delayed
Nonetheless, on the whole, capacity utilisation remains unsatisfactory
On the one hand, structural changes in the economy still have a dampening effect on prices
Reacting to the strong franc and the lacklustre economy, the National Bank has made significant interest rate cuts, thereby considerably relaxing the monetary conditions For the time being it will maintain its expansionary monetary course so as to Swiss National Bank
This scenario for the global economy is subject to high uncertainty, with risks on the upside and downside alike
At the same time, geopolitical tensions and rising commodity and food prices lead to upside risks to inflation across the globe
Negative interest and interventions are necessary to reduce the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments and thus counteract the upward pressure on the currency
As a result of the deterioration in the global economic outlook and the downward revision of GDP for earlier quarters, the SNB is now expecting growth of around 1 for Switzerland in 2012, as opposed to the 1.5 projected in the June forecast
In the EU, however, the growth rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 was lower than anticipated
Owing to weak GDP momentum in late 2016early 2017, the current year is likely to see growth of just under 1.0
The new inflation forecast dashed red curve on the chart covers the period from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011
Despite more favourable exchange rate conditions, Swiss exports again fell in the second quarter
The negative interest charge is to be limited to what is necessary, however
Consequently, inflation will exceed the 2 mark from the end of the forecasting period
The target range for the three-month Libor will remain unchanged at 0.000.25
The National Bank has pointed out on several occasions that we ought not be deceived by the relative stability of the Swiss franceuro exchange rate
Economic developments over the coming quarters will hinge on which additional containment measures are taken in the countries affected
This reflects the efforts of the SNB to provide the interbank market with sufficient liquidity as a response to the increased demand for liquidity which, for its part, was due to a climate in which financial sector agents had lost trust in one another
It intends to hold the rate in the middle of the target range for the time being
Tensions can reappear at any moment on global financial markets
It therefore adheres to its expansionary monetary policy
Among other things, this decrease reflects the appreciation of the Swiss franc over the last three months
The SNB will continue to monitor the development of inflation closely, and will adjust its monetary policy again if necessary to ensure inflation remains within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term
Under the current circumstances, there is the risk that inflationary patterns become entrenched because once the expectation of rising prices has taken hold, it is difficult to correct it
It will continue to provide the economy with a generous supply of liquidity and, if necessary, to purchase Swiss franc bonds with a view to reducing risk premia on long-term debt instruments issued by private sector borrowers
The impact of changes in money stocks on prices is subject to a considerable lag, due to the fact that these changes initially affect activities in the real economy
The uncertainties relate to the global economy and to the level of recovery within the financial industry
Therefore, even though capacity utilisation rates have fallen slightly and staff shortages have become less acute, it is still true to say that capacity utilisation remains at levels above the historical norm
What the economy needs to recover, however, is for exports to pick up
In line with the December forecast, Switzerlands economy will grow at a more moderate pace in 2008
Overall, substantial risks remain, with the focus on issues relating to the economic outlook for Greece and the Ukraine conflict
While, on the one hand, structural changes in the economy are having more of a dampening effect on prices, the high level of capacity utilisation and exchange rate movements, on the other, are exacerbating the risk of higher production costs being increasingly passed on to prices
Unemployment has increased around the world, although short-time work schemes in various countries have so far prevented a stronger rise
Discussions with company representatives conducted by the SNBs delegates for regional economic relations also suggest a moderate improvement of the economic situation
This would have grave consequences for the international financial system
The Swiss National Bank is leaving the SNB policy rate unchanged at 1.75
Added to this, a renewed deterioration in the pandemic situation cannot be ruled out
It is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75, and remains willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration
The domestic sector is still performing favourably
Interest on sight deposits at the SNB remains at 0.75 and the target range for the three-month Libor is unchanged at between 1.25 and 0.25
The SNB continues to expect GDP growth of around 2 for 2018 and a further gradual decrease in unemployment
The Swiss financial system has sufficient liquidity
Mortgage growth was also slightly lower in the first half of 2013 than in the previous year
Unless otherwise specified, a change in the negative interest rate will apply with immediate effect, and the affected sight deposit account balances will be subject to the new interest rate on the day of the announcement
The SNBs new conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the SNB policy rate is 0.25 over the entire forecast horizon
Due to the substantial risks associated with the future path of the international economy, financial markets and energy prices, this forecast involves considerable uncertainties
In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB anticipates that further waves of infection will be successfully prevented
Next year, growth is likely to decline slightly, but should nevertheless remain above potential
This correction is the result, in particular, of the less favourable economic outlook for Europe compared with the last assessment
This does not jeopardise price stability
It is likely that final demand will still be curbed, in particular, by the high levels of unemployment and the bleak outlook for public finances
In the residential investment property segment, the strong price growth continued
15 March 2007 4 With todays decision to increase the three-month Libor by 25 basis points, the SNB has maintained its monetary policy course of gradual normalisation
In the advanced economies, growth was slightly more positive than in the first quarter; this was mainly attributable to the economic recovery in the US
With rising exports, equipment investment in Switzerland is also likely to go up again
Consequently, in the foreseeable future, there is no risk of inflation in Switzerland
For 2019 the forecast stands at 0.4, for 2020 at 0.1 and for 2021 at 0.5
The Swiss National Bank SNB leaves the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
Russias invasion of Ukraine has led to a strong increase in uncertainty worldwide
Given the favourable inflation outlook in the medium term, the National Bank can afford to do so
With its decision to leave the three-month Libor unchanged, the National Bank is adhering to its current monetary policy course and is making use of its monetary policy leeway to support the recovery of the economy without jeopardising long-term price stability
However, production capacity will remain underutilised for some time yet
Exports will be another factor boosting economic growth
Switzerlands economy has continued to recover
Inflationary pressure is likely to remain moderate
Although the situation on the global financial markets has eased somewhat, the minimum exchange rate, with the three-month Libor close to zero, remains essential
For example, inflation could rise further and thus weigh even more heavily on real incomes and consumer demand
The National Bank anticipates economic growth to be 1.5 - 2 for 2004
For 2020, the SNB now expects an inflation rate of 0.2, compared to 0.7 last quarter
Both short-time work and unemployment have declined further
This scenario for the global economy is subject to significant risks
The broad-based, healthy economic situation had a positive impact on the labour market
The positive baseline scenario for the global economy continues to be subject to risks
In the US, economic activity was driven mainly by strong consumer demand, and labour market developments continued to be favourable
There are, however, downside risks for price stability should the Swiss franc not weaken further
Debiting the negative interest triggers a sight deposit account transfer by the SNB for Swiss Interbank Clearing SIC system participants
The forecast now stands at 0.2 for 2021, 0.4 for 2022 and 0.5 for 2023
Given the current inflation outlook, it can be assumed that price stability is guaranteed for the next two years
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro
The Swiss franc has strengthened since the beginning of the year
Risk premia on the capital market have dropped
The inflation prospects have changed since the monetary policy assessment in December 2006
The Swiss National Bank is increasing the target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 0.501.50
The National Bank will therefore keep a close watch on the developments in the financial markets, the global economy, the price of oil and the Swiss franc so as to assess their impact on the inflation
The Swiss franc nevertheless remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile
The revised GDP figures for recent years reveal stronger growth momentum than was originally reported
It puts average annual inflation at 1.2 for 2024, 0.6 for 2025 and 0.7 for 2026 cf
For 2012, the forecast shows an inflation rate of 0.5
For 2012, the SNB is expecting inflation of 0.3 and for 2013, of 0.4
That said, value added has been seriously impacted in industries particularly affected by the containment measures
The other major economic areas also recorded favourable economic activity in the third quarter
GDP thus rose only slightly in the fourth quarter of 2020, this following robust growth in the previous quarter
The global economy has improved over the past few months and the downturn in the Swiss economy has proved to be considerably less substantial than had been forecast in the second quarter
The forecast puts average annual inflation at 1.4 for 2024, 1.2 for 2025 and 1.1 for 2026 cf
The improvement is beginning to assist the Swiss export sector, while the domestic sector is performing well
For 2020, the SNB anticipates an inflation rate of 0.7, compared to 0.6 last quarter
The rate of growth in this area has risen since November, reaching 3.8 in January
Despite a difficult climate worldwide, economic activity in Switzerland stabilised somewhat during the second half of 2002
By contrast, international trade and global manufacturing remain subdued
Our modifications to the assumptions on the global economy are relatively minor and have no significant impact on the outlook for inflation
Second, monetary policy in the advanced economies remains very expansionary
As economic recovery progresses, the SNB will continue to gradually adjust its monetary policy
Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued and should continue to weaken over time
Finally, there are still important downside risks to growth from the war in Ukraine and the pandemic
Despite the most recent interest rate cut, the new forecast up to mid-2004 is virtually the same as that published at the end of last year
The imponderables with respect to the development of the global economy remain considerable, and a sustained economic upswing in Switzerland is not likely until some time in the second half of 2003
However, Germanys economic upturn stands out considerably from the European average
The new inflation forecast calculated with a constant interest rate of 2.25 is shown in red
This favourable forecast is based, among other things, on the assumption that the global economy continues to grow and that the war in Ukraine does not escalate further
Both mortgage lending and prices for single-family homes and privately owned apartments continued to rise slightly in recent quarters, while prices in the residential investment property segment stagnated
On the assumption that the three-month Libor will remain unchanged at 0.75, annual inflation is expected to stand at 1 in 2006 and reach 2.1 in 2007
Until the beginning of 2006, the inflation trend according to the new forecast will fall short of that projected in June
Coronavirus is posing exceptionally large challenges for Switzerland, both socially and economically
In the US and Asia, growth slowed in the second quarter of 2010
Under the present circumstances, this represents an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions
For all other sight deposit account holders not mentioned under method 1, the SNB sets a_ fixed threshold
Like the previous forecast dashdotted green curve, it is based on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75
Turning to Switzerland, economic developments in recent months have been in line with SNB expectations
The other industries in the manufacturing sector recorded a more modest expansion, in line with the slowdown in manufacturing worldwide
However, inflation is likely to increase again somewhat in the coming months due to higher electricity prices and rents, as well as the rise in VAT
The National Bank views the prospects for the global economy more cautiously than it did only three months ago
Notwithstanding positive signals emanating from the US, global economic development is still subject to risks
Growth was primarily driven by manufacturing, which benefited from dynamic economic developments abroad and the weaker Swiss franc
As the economy recovers, the price of oil is likely to edge upwards again gradually
Since the last assessment, the Swiss franc has appreciated substantially against the euro and the US dollar
In addition, the consequences of the earthquake catastrophe in Japan are, at this stage, difficult to assess
The risks in the international environment, however, have increased markedly causing growing uncertainty as to the further development in Switzerland
Economic activity has declined sharply in the U.S., where consumption and exports have plummeted
Against this backdrop, the SNB expects GDP growth of 2.5 to 3 for 2021
At the same time, imbalances on these markets have decreased slightly overall due to developments in fundamentals
The monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted worldwide are providing important support in this regard
Accordingly, the monetary aggregates grew at a slower pace following the two interest rate decisions of June and September 2004
Developments in the global economy are mixed
At the same time, high inflation could become entrenched as a result of increased secondround effects, requiring stronger monetary policy responses in other countries
Economic signals for the coming months remain favourable
In addition, the SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor at 0.00.25
With the measures decided today, the SNB is forecasting average annual inflation for the following two years of virtually zero
At the same time, a worsening in the tight supply of raw materials could lead to a further rise in inflation globally
Should unexpected developments push up the Swiss franc sharply, the National Bank will take appropriate action
The situation on the financial markets has eased somewhat recently
Against this backdrop, unemployment has increased slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis
In Switzerland, a perceptible economic upswing is only to be expected in the course of 2004
Overall, global economic growth was solid in the second quarter
Thereafter, forecast inflation rises more rapidly than in the December forecast, due to the interest rate reductions since the last monetary policy assessment
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25, average annual inflation is expected to amount to 0.6 this year, 0.4 next year, and 1.2 in 2005
After this step, the interest target range will again exhibit a spread of 100 basis points
According to the National Banks assessment, the Swiss economy will see only moderate growth rates until mid-2003
The forecast is still associated with considerable uncertainties
Yields on Swiss Confederation bonds have also fallen
There is still considerable uncertainty over how the situation will develop
The inflation forecast shows that the rate of inflation will drop below the 2 mark in 2009
Several indicators were already pointing to a brighter outlook for the economic situation, and second-quarter economic data now confirm the picture of a broad-based recovery
The latest rise in inflation is principally due to higher prices for goods, especially energy and food
However, it is still clearly above the range the SNB equates with price stability
This has resulted in a renewed deterioration in the economic outlook
This reflects the dampening effect of todays interest rate decision
The National Bank uses the inflation forecast to summarise its assessment of the inflation outlook and to communicate the future need for action in monetary policy
The Swiss National Bank leaves the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
It also shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising medium and long-term price stability
The SNBs conditional inflation forecast for 2010 and 2011 has increased slightly since March
In doing so, it is countering inflationary pressure, which has increased again over the medium term
Moreover, given the fact that the price of oil has been surprisingly immune to the global economic slowdown, it expects higher inflation in industrialised countries
The National Bank last adjusted its monetary policy on 26 July 2002, when it lowered the target range by 50 basis points
Economic growth was modest in the advanced economies in the first quarter of 2023
Exports are likely to continue to recover, and this should stimulate corporate investment and have a positive impact on the labour market
For one thing, the tight real estate market in the large urban areas and surroundings is likely to lead to higher housing rents even though the mortgage rates have declined somewhat
To ensure appropriate monetary conditions, the SNB is also willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary
Economic development in Switzerland lost considerable momentum in the first three quarters of 2001
Economic recovery is not yet sustainable
For the two following years, a further increase in exports, a rise in equipment investment, robust private consumption and sustained economic growth are anticipated
This development makes it possible to reduce rates again
Mortgage lending and residential property prices have risen strongly in recent quarters
It is also continuing to supply the banking system with liquidity on generous terms
The exchange rate is important to the National Bank
This has led to a general increase in inflation
Consequently, the positive output gap should gradually close
The rate of growth of mortgage loans attained 3.6 in July
In particular, uncertainty regarding economic developments in China has increased perceptibly
The magnitude of the contraction in demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 was unexpected
Moreover, although the financial industry is well into the process of recovery, another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out
In the fourth quarter of 2014, growth in the US remained above potential
To strengthen the banks in this role, the SNB is raising the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system
Its aim, however, is to prevent a premature changeover to a more restrictive monetary policy, which would endanger the upswing in Switzerland
Owing to data adjustments, the new forecast is slightly lower overall than the December projection
At present, the financial crisis has not had any impact on the granting of domestic loans
2 Banks as defined by the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks
The latest forecast expects inflation to rise to over 2 in the second half of 2005, given a constant interest rate of 0.25
RP 36, is considered to start on the 20th calendar day three months before the beginning of the respective interest period
The Swiss National Bank is lowering the SNB policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5
It covers the period from the third quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2013 and shows 16 September 2010 3 future inflation developments on the assumption of the three-month Libor remaining constant at 0.25 over the entire forecasting horizon
In line with most forecasting institutions, the SNB is now expecting a sharper downturn in the US economy and  to a lesser extent  in Europe
The conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the threemonth Libor remains at 0.75 over the entire forecast horizon
Swiss GDP growth was moderate in the fourth quarter of last year
This rise will be more significant than expected at the last assessment
The average inflation rate for the year 2003 will presumably amount to 1.3
The fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 saw a stagnation of economic activity in Switzerland, with the high price of oil as well as the depreciation of the dollar in the final quarter of 2004 acting as brakes
The Swiss National Bank is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
Moreover, a not inconsiderable risk of deflation remains
The target range for the three-month Libor remains at 0.000.25
The SNB still assumes there will be a further  albeit slightly slower  recovery, particularly in the industrialised countries
The inflation forecast puts average annual inflation at 2.2 for 2023 and 2024, and at 1.9 for 2025 cf
For this reason, the SNB has decided to maintain the monetary policy adopted in March
First, the significant decline in oil prices is helping to increase demand
The explanation for both the negative inflation in 2009 and the increase in prices at the beginning of 2010 is to be found in a base effect attributable to changes in energy prices
Compared to December, the inflation forecast has even fallen further
This pattern was confirmed after the interest rate hike of December 2005
The measures announced at the weekend by the federal government, FINMA and the SNB have put a halt to the crisis
In March, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast was adjusted downwards once again
It is continuing its generous and flexible provision of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market
Since December, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast has remained almost unchanged at an average of 0.7 for 2010 and 0.9 for 2011
Despite the sluggish development in the first quarter of 2005, the SNB still expects the economy to recover during the course of the year, with an increase in momentum in the second half
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.75, average annual inflation is expected to lie between 0.7 and 1.6 in the next three years
The SNB will also use liquidity-absorbing measures
This decline, however, is partly due to special factors, notably the strong influence of clearance sales prices for clothing
However, it has increased its inflation forecast and is now expecting an average rate of 2.7 in 2008
In the US, growth became more broad based
Nevertheless, the SNB still holds the view that the return to full capacity utilisation will be slower and more uncertain overall than is usually the case at the end of a recession
Inflation prospects for the medium term now look more positive than they did at the March assessment
In January 2004 inflation fell to 0.2
For 2011 as a whole, real GDP growth of 1.52.0 can be expected
For sight deposit account holders subject to minimum reserve requirements domestic_ _banks2 The exemption threshold is calculated as a basis component minus a cash holdings_ component
In the current situation, the inflation outlook remains subject to high uncertainty
While growth in real estate prices weakened overall in the second quarter, growth in mortgage lending was virtually unchanged compared to the previous quarter
Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve decided on 15 March to raise its key interest rate by a further 25 basis points
In line with the SNBs expectations, the global economy has strengthened further
After having averaged 0.6 in the fourth quarter of 2003, the core inflation rate calculated by the National Bank also dropped slightly to 0.4 in January
Average annual inflation is likely to amount to 1.4 in 2009 and 2010
Imbalances thus persist on these markets and continue to present risks for financial stability
Equally, geopolitical tensions could increase
Negative interest and the willingness to intervene are important in order to counteract the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments and thus ease pressure on the currency
It remains a pillar of the economy
In December, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast was adjusted downwards slightly
As a result, inflation will be higher in 2011 and, particularly, in 2012, if the current expansionary monetary policy is maintained indefinitely
The interest rate on sight deposits with the SNB remains at 0.75
In the meantime, the risk of a further weakening of economic activity and the associated danger of a deflationary price development in Switzerland have become smaller
The labour market is showing signs of improvement
It will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions
It is thus projected to remain below 1 until mid-2005
Uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains high
Inflation reached 2.9 in May and is likely to remain at an elevated level for the time being
Equally, the energy situation in Europe could deteriorate again in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024
The export industry is bearing the brunt, however
Swiss GDP growth was moderate in the first quarter of 2024
Uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains exceptionally high and the risks for the global financial system have increased substantially
On the one hand, new waves of infection could weigh on economic activity again
To date, the crises of confidence in Turkey and Argentina have not materially impacted the global economic outlook
The European economy will continue to perform favourably
For the following years, upside and downside risks are more symmetrical
Moreover, momentum in the Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets remains strong, and has led to a further increase in risks for financial stability
The increasingly tighter monetary policy in many countries should also help inflation gradually return to more moderate levels
Growth is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters
These positions are used to calculate the threshold for all interest periods which follow a new incorporation, change to legal structure or transformation and are relevant for calculating the exemption threshold cf
Upside risks predominate in connection with the inflation forecast for the current year
Through to late summer, the Swiss economy also recovered markedly and more strongly than originally expected from the first wave of the pandemic
The SNBs new conditional inflation forecast is therefore above that of December, particularly for 2022 cf
As expected, growth in Switzerland picked up somewhat in the first quarter, after having been relatively weak in the previous quarter
Assuming that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75, the SNB expects an average annual inflation rate of 0.6 in 2007, 1.5 in 2008, and 1.8 in 2009
The new conditional inflation forecast for 2021 and 2022 is slightly higher than in March
Considerable risks are attached to this inflation forecast
For this purpose, it is prepared to purchase foreign currency in unlimited quantities
Nevertheless, forecast inflation remains low for the next few years
The new conditional inflation forecast is significantly lower than that of June
The reasons for this development are two-fold
First, surveys point to increased competitive pressure and narrow margins for many Swiss export firms
The new conditional inflation forecast does not differ greatly from the one we presented in March
Even under this assumption, however, GDP growth is likely to be negative for the year as a whole
Consequently, the unemployment rate has risen again slightly in recent months
In Europe, growth was, geographically, broader-based than in previous quarters
Subdued demand from abroad, the loss of purchasing power due to inflation, and more restrictive financing conditions are having a dampening effect
For 2017, however, the forecast is down to 0.1, from 0.2 in the previous quarter
The oil price expectations were adjusted slightly upwards compared with the previous assessment in December
Residential investment property prices also rose, albeit at a somewhat slower pace
Due to the deepening of the global recession, the SNB is now forecasting a contraction in GDP of between 2.5 and 3 for this year
Should the three-month Libor rate remain unchanged at 0.75, inflation would reach 2.6 by the end of the forecasting horizon
At the end of the forecast horizon, inflation stands at 2.1
With todays decision to increase the three-month Libor by 0.25 percentage points, the National Bank is adhering to its previous monetary policy course
In the second quarter 2002, real GDP was slightly below last years level, but did not contract again compared with the previous quarter
The SNB policy rate change applies from tomorrow, 17 June 2022
The financial industry is gradually recovering, but another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out
Inflation has risen again in recent months, and stood at 2.2 in February
The recovery of the global economy continues and the Swiss economy is benefiting from it
The new forecast puts average annual inflation at 3 for 2022, 2.4 for 2023 and 1.7 for 2024 cf
Swiss GDP growth was solid in the first quarter of 2023
The short-term outlook has deteriorated
Growth is likely to remain rather modest in Switzerland in the coming quarters due to the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc and the moderate development of the global economy
Economic growth is expected to continue in the second half of the year
For 2003, the National Bank is anticipating economic growth of just over 1, while zero growth is to be expected in the current year
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.25, average annual inflation is expected to hover between 0.9 and 1.6 in the next three years
The higher commodity prices will lift inflation further in the short term
The sluggish economic environment in Europe, in particular, has had a dampening effect
Cash holdings in the last RP cash holdings component
At the same time, high inflation could become embedded and require stronger monetary policy responses abroad
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing upward pressure on the currency
In manufacturing and in the service sector, it is at a satisfactory level, while in the construction industry it is high
Economic activity was as anticipated, and the inflation outlook was also confirmed at the new assessment
For 2018, the SNB now expects inflation of 0.5, compared to 0.6 in the third quarter
Owing to a slight deterioration in the outlook for the global economy, medium-term inflation is somewhat lower than predicted in September
Against this backdrop, the SNB with its monetary policy is ensuring price stability and supporting the Swiss economy
The new inflation forecast shows that, with a three-month Libor of 2.75, the inflation outlook is almost unchanged from that in June
Since March 2001, the National Bank has eased its monetary policy substantially, lowering the target range for the three-month Libor by a total of 2.75 percentage points
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary therefore remain essential
However, the SNB anticipates that, as abroad, there will be only a partial recovery for the time being, and GDP will not return quickly to its pre-crisis level
This positive development is likely to continue in the coming months
Recently, the National Bank has adjusted its monetary policy twice already
In Switzerland, as expected, the fourth quarter of 2013 saw a weakening of growth momentum, largely as a result of a decline in exports, which led to a corresponding decrease in value added in the manufacturing industry
All in all, positive economic signals in recent months have helped ease the situation on the international financial markets, which were dominated by turbulence at the start of the year
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.75, inflation is expected to hover between 0.9 and 1.5 in the next three years
Banks sight deposits held at the SNB will be remunerated at the SNB policy rate up to a certain threshold, and at 1.0 above this threshold
GDP growth again exceeded potential growth and was broad based
Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25, average inflation for 2010 is expected to amount to 0.9, for 2011 to 1.0 and for 2012 to 2.2
Short-time working has reached unprecedented levels, unemployment has risen rapidly, and consumer sentiment has fallen to a record low
The subdued demand from abroad and the loss of purchasing power due to inflation are having a dampening effect
On the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain unchanged at 0.75, the National Bank expects an annual inflation rate of 1.1 in 2005 and 1.3 in 2006
This is based on the assumption that no measures will have to be introduced that would additionally impair economic activity
For 2013, the SNB now anticipates slightly lower inflation of 0.3
Imbalances persist on the mortgage and real estate markets
The rise in long-term interest rates can be expected to stabilise money growth to a certain degree
The SNB has revised downwards its growth expectations for the UK and the euro area
Therefore, despite the easing of the situation, the negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary remain essential
In spite of the fact that money market rates are already very low, the National Bank still has effective instruments at its disposal
Until the fourth quarter of 2008, the curve representing the March forecast is higher than that for December
The situation on the foreign exchange market continues to be fragile
Owing to the low level of inflation, the National Bank has been able to ease monetary policy substantially since March 2001, having since then lowered the target range for the three-month Libor by a total of 2.75 percentage points
Moreover, the outlook for the emerging economies has deteriorated, and events in the Middle East could push up the oil price
The Libor has declined, in line with the SNBs stated intention, which is to bring the Libor down gradually to the lower end of the target range
The global economic recovery is continuing, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than the SNB had assumed at the time of the previous monetary policy assessment
By contrast, economic activity in the emerging economies was sluggish
Nevertheless, as regards both consumption and investment, demand is likely to remain moderate for the time being
Due to the risks mentioned previously, this conditional inflation forecast is associated with a very high level of uncertainty
It is too soon to tell whether this is an effect linked to the lowering of the three-month Libor, as has been observed in the past
The SNB will take firm action to prevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro
Another appreciation would have a serious impact on both prices and the economy in Switzerland
The National Bank has not made any further change to its monetary policy in its assessment of 20 March 2003
The US economy is growing at a slightly slower pace than expected, and the downside risks have increased
Global growth lost momentum somewhat in the third quarter
The gradual improvement of the global economy is likely to further strengthen foreign demand for Swiss goods and services
In addition, uncertainty about future developments in the fiscal policies of numerous advanced economies is dampening consumer and investment confidence and poses risks to growth
The SNB stands ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures as required
As the other loans remained steady, aggregate lending grew more slowly than mortgage loans
This will increase the capital requirements for these exposures as of 30 September 2022, and will maintain  and where necessary, strengthen  the banking sectors resilience
The economic recovery, while certainly underway, nevertheless remains fragile
Against this background, the Swiss National Bank SNB is making another interest rate cut and acting to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro
To this end, it will increase liquidity substantially by engaging in additional repo operations, buying Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers and purchasing foreign currency on the foreign exchange markets
The global economy exhibited strong, broad-based growth in the third quarter
The trade-weighted exchange rate of the Swiss franc is practically unchanged compared with September 2019
GDP contracted again in the second quarter
Up to the first quarter of 2017, the path of inflation remains almost the same
By raising the target range, the National Bank is further adjusting its monetary policy stance to developments in the economy
The situation on the labour market has also continued to improve
According to a provisional assessment by SECO, real gross domestic product GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006 grew at an annualised rate of 1.8 compared with the previous period
At the present time, this expansive monetary policy does not pose any risk to price stability in Switzerland
During the last few months, the inflation rate has risen considerably as a result of the increase in energy prices
In July, it contracted to 0.3 and amounted to 0.5 in August
The global economy exhibited strong, broad-based growth in the second quarter
As regards the global economy, the risks remain to the downside, owing to numerous structural problems
Overall, the revised quarterly estimates for GDP suggest a somewhat stronger recovery of the Swiss economy since the middle of last year
As is the case with the global economy, the risks for this scenario remain to the downside
For this reason, the SNBs inflation forecast is embedded in a global economic scenario
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy
In the current situation, inflation and growth forecasts are subject to unusually high uncertainty
The outlook with respect to inflation remains essentially unchanged
Real estate prices, by contrast, climbed at a marginally faster rate
As in the December forecast, the decline in inflation in 2005 is largely due to a base effect
Annual inflation dropped to 1.1 in August from the 1.4 recorded in July
While the growth dynamic in emerging economies is vigorous, the recovery in the industrialised economies remains modest overall
Developments on the labour market also remained positive
Consequently, the path of the new forecast initially lies above that of the December forecast
The economic recovery should therefore regain momentum in the course of next year
The situation on the mortgage and real estate markets still requires the full attention of the SNB
GDP is likely to expand by around 1 in 2019, and the SNB expects growth of between 1.5 and 2 in 2020
The franc is virtually unchanged against the euro
This would be the strongest decline since the crisis in the mid-1970s
The recession continued in the euro area
Foreign exchange markets are very volatile
Equally, a renewed increase in geopolitical tensions could result in weaker development of global economic activity
The situation on the financial markets is still uncertain, but less turbulent than it was a few months ago
Together with the sharp fall in oil prices, the appreciation of the Swiss franc since the minimum exchange rate was discontinued moves inflation further into negative territory for a short period
Recently, however, economic momentum has slowed somewhat
Generally, in times of slow economic activity, a decline is recorded in loans not secured by mortgages
In this environment, unemployment is likely to continue to rise gradually, and the utilisation of production capacity is likely to decline somewhat further
Profit margins are still under pressure at many companies, and the willingness to invest and the demand for labour remain commensurately subdued
This is due to the prices of imported goods and services, in particular oil
The Swiss National Bank will enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro set on 6 September with the utmost determination
The Swiss National Bank is lowering the SNB policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25
It is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75
Global economic performance at the beginning of the year was slightly weaker than had been anticipated at the quarterly assessment in December
The SNB will continue to monitor developments on the mortgage and real estate markets closely
This will also have an impact on the economic development in our country
The SNBs conditional inflation forecast of September points to significantly lower inflationary pressure in the medium term
The change applies from tomorrow, 22 March 2024
For 2016, an inflation rate of 0.5 is expected, and for 2017, the forecast is now at 0.3 instead of 0.4
At 1.8 in February, the price increase for domestic goods is distinctly higher than the CPI increase
A weakening in global economic momentum cannot be excluded
With the decline in the quality of certain borrowers during a recession and the contraction in economic activity, it is inevitable that a cyclical tightening of lending conditions, or even a fall in the amount outstanding, will occur
The further deterioration in the inflation outlook stems partly from the unfavourable prospects for the global economy and a more pronounced underutilisation of production capacity in Switzerland, and partly from the fact that a depreciation of the Swiss franc has failed to materialise as expected
The SNB is now expecting the inflation rate to be 0.2 percentage points lower for both 2014 and 2015, at 0 and 0.4 respectively
The expansionary monetary policy continues to be necessary given the latest international developments and the inflation outlook in Switzerland
A correction to the expansionary monetary policy pursued by the SNB for a long time now will be necessary if the economic outlook improves
The SNB will therefore continue to keep a close watch on these factors, so as to be able to react quickly should the need arise
In addition, following a period of stabilisation, prices in the owner-occupied residential property segment rose again slightly
The Swiss National Bank SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between 1.25 and 0.25
It will continue to provide the Swiss franc money market with a generous and flexible supply of liquidity
The latest inflation forecast is based on the assumption that inflation will remain below the 2 level in the next three years
Assuming a constant rate of 0.5 for the three-month Libor, the SNB is now forecasting average annual inflation of 0.9 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010
For the second half of the year, and in particular for 2011, however, the SNB now expects a marked slowdown in growth
September 2012 2 Downside risks to the Swiss economy will also stay high in the near term
This is primarily due to the rise in oil prices and the weaker Swiss franc
Consequently, the inflation forecasts are based on assumptions with regard to the future path of the global economy
At its monetary policy assessment in June, the SNB was still expecting growth of roughly 1.5
As compared to our June assessment, the outlook for inflation has remained largely unchanged, with the exception of the end of the three-year forecast period
Developments abroad represent the main risk
The healthy economy will stimulate the labour market again this year and result in a further drop in the unemployment rate
This will ensure that the secured short-term Swiss franc money market rates are close to the SNB policy rate
At the same time, inflation in many countries is markedly above central banks targets
Nevertheless from mid-2015 onwards, inflation will be lower than forecast in the previous quarter
