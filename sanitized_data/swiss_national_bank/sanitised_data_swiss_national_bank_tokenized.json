        "The SNB stands ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures, as required.",
        "Although the situation on the global financial markets has eased somewhat, the minimum exchange rate, with the three-month Libor close to zero, remains essential.",
        "It prevents an undesired tightening of monetary conditions were the upward pressure on the Swiss franc to intensify once again.",
        "The target range for the three-month Libor will stay at 0.0–0.25%.",
        "The inflation outlook has hardly changed since June.",
        "The SNB’s conditional inflation forecast is somewhat higher in the short term, due to a rise in the oil price since the last quarter and the slightly more positive assessment of the economic situation.",
        "As last quarter, the forecast is based on a three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years.",
        "The SNB now anticipates somewhat higher inflation of –0.2% for 2013 and 0.3% for 2014.",
        "The inflation forecast for 2015 remains unchanged at 0.7%.",
        "There are therefore no signs of inflation risks in Switzerland.",
        "Recent months have seen a continuation of the slow recovery in the global economy.",
        "In the second quarter, GDP growth in the advanced economies was stronger than expected, especially in Germany and France.",
        "By contrast, economic activity in the emerging economies was sluggish.",
        "In the near term, global growth should gradually gain in momentum and become more broad based.",
        "Nevertheless, the recovery is likely to remain subdued.",
        "The risk of less favourable global economic developments has decreased somewhat compared to the last quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, structural problems in Europe persist, which could cause new tensions on the markets.",
        "Moreover, the outlook for the emerging economies has deteriorated, and events in the Middle East could push up the oil price.",
        "In addition, sudden changes in expectations on the further course of monetary policy in key currency areas could lead to increased volatility on the financial markets.",
        "In Switzerland, GDP growth in the second quarter exceeded expectations.",
        "While the service industries experienced mainly robust growth, value added in manufacturing declined.",
        "Exports in the second half of 2013 should pick up on the back of firmer demand from abroad.",
        "Because of the unexpectedly positive second quarter, the SNB has now revised its 2013 growth forecast upwards from 1.0–1.5% to 1.5–2.0%.",
        "On the domestic mortgage and real estate markets, the danger persists that imbalances will increase further.",
        "There are, however, some signs of an easing.",
        "The price growth in some segments of the real estate market slowed somewhat in the second quarter.",

        "It stands ready to take further measures at any time.",
        "The SNB’s conditional inflation forecast has been adjusted downwards appreciably over the entire forecast period compared to the previous quarter.",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2012, inflation was lower than expected due to the continued decline in import inflation.",
        "Furthermore, the economic outlook is once again somewhat subdued, especially for the euro area.",
        "The inflation forecast is based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years.",

        "In the foreseeable future, therefore, there continues to be no threat of inflation in Switzerland.",

        "The unemployment rate rose again slightly, despite a rise in employment.",
        "The SNB continues to anticipate growth of 1.0–1.5% for Switzerland in 2013.",
        "On 13 February 2013, at the proposal of the SNB, the Federal Council activated the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB).",
        "As of September, banks will therefore be required to provide more capital backing for residential mortgage loans in Switzerland.",
        "The aim of the CCB is to strengthen the resilience of banks and counter imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets.",
        "These imbalances have reached such a level that they pose a risk to the stability of the banking system and hence the Swiss economy.",
        "The SNB continues to 14 March 2013 2 monitor the momentum on the domestic residential mortgage and real estate markets closely.",
        "Downside risks to the Swiss economy remain considerable.",
        "There is a risk that tensions in the euro area will increase again.",
        "In addition, uncertainty about future developments in the fiscal policies of numerous advanced economies is dampening consumer and investment confidence and poses risks to growth.",
        "The global economic situation and sentiment on the financial markets therefore remain vulnerable.",

        "The SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at 0.0–0.25%.",
        "In December, the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast was adjusted downwards slightly.",
        "On the one hand, the unexpectedly low rates of inflation for October and November are serving as a lower departure point for the forecast.",
        "On the other, the decline in inflation in the euro area and the slight fall in the oil price are also helping to dampen the inflation outlook.",
        "As in the previous quarter, the forecast is based on a three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years.",
        "For 2013, the SNB anticipates an unchanged inflation rate of –0.2%.",
        "For 2014 and 2015, the inflation forecast is down in each case by 0.1 percentage points and is now at 0.2% and 0.6% respectively.",
        "Consequently, no inflation risks can be identified for Switzerland in the foreseeable future.",
        "As expected, the global economic recovery continued in the third quarter, with the main drivers being the US, the UK and China.",
        "In the euro area, by contrast, growth lacked momentum.",
        "In many emerging economies, too, economic activity was rather sluggish.",
        "For the coming months, the SNB expects a slight increase in global growth overall.",
        "However, uncertainty about the continued recovery of the world economy remains high.",
        "In many advanced economies, low interest rates and high government indebtedness are constraining room for manoeuvre in economic policy and making the global economy prone to shocks.",
        "The forthcoming assessment of banks’ balance sheets in the euro area as well as the further course of monetary policy normalisation in the major currency areas could lead to noticeable spikes on international financial markets.",
        "In Switzerland, the economy continued to develop favourably in the third quarter.",
        "However, there are signs that growth may weaken temporarily in the fourth quarter.",
        "The SNB continues to expect growth of 1.5–2.0% for 2013.",
        "For 2014, it expects a growth rate of around 2.0%.",
        "However, given the vulnerable economic situation abroad, downside risks still prevail for Switzerland.",
        "In an environment of persistently low interest rates, the danger of a further build-up of imbalances on mortgage and real estate markets remains considerable.",
        "For this reason, the SNB continues to monitor the situation very closely, and regularly assesses whether the countercyclical capital buffer should be adjusted.",
        "The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro.",
        "The Swiss franc is still high.",
        "An appreciation of the Swiss franc would compromise price stability and would have serious consequences for the Swiss economy.",
        "In the current environment, the minimum exchange rate remains important in order to avoid an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions for Switzerland in the event of sudden upward pressure on the Swiss franc.",
        "The SNB stands ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures, as required.",
        "The target range for the three-month Libor will be left unchanged at 0.0–0.25%.",
        "Since March, the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast has remained almost unchanged, apart from inflation for the current year, which is slightly lower due to a reduction in the oil price.",
        "The forecast is again based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years.",
        "For 2013, the SNB now anticipates slightly lower inflation of –0.3%.",
        "For 2014, the inflation forecast is unchanged at 0.2% and for 2015, at 0.7%.",
        "Consequently, inflation in Switzerland will remain very low in the foreseeable future.",
        "In the first quarter of 2013, the global economy was weaker than expected.",
        "The recession continued in the euro area.",
        "In the US, the recovery remained hesitant and in China, economic activity lost strength.",
        "In Switzerland, real GDP rose significantly in the first quarter.",
        "However, the SNB expects a perceptible weakening in growth for the second quarter.",
        "Overall, it still anticipates growth of 1.0–1.5% for 2013.",
        "The risks for the Swiss economy remain high.",
        "They continue to originate, for the most part, from the international environment.",
        "A weakening in global economic momentum cannot be excluded.",
        "Further developments in the euro area financial and sovereign debt crisis remain uncertain.",
        "Tensions can reappear at any moment on global financial markets.",
        "Domestically, there is a risk that the imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets will grow, given the sustained period of exceptionally low interest rates."

        "The SNB has once again adjusted its conditional inflation forecast downwards compared to the previous quarter.",
        "Above all, the appreciably lower oil price will push inflation into negative territory during the next four quarters.",
        "Over the medium to long term, persistently low inflation across the globe and the even weaker outlook for the euro area economy will dampen inflation in Switzerland.",
        "For 2014, the SNB has revised its inflation forecast downwards by 0.1 percentage points to 0.0%.",
        "For 2015, forecast inflation will even turn negative, at –0.1%.",
        "Only in 2016 is inflation expected to rise slightly, to 0.3%.",
        "This constitutes a downward adjustment of 0.3 percentage points for 2015, and 0.2 percentage points for 2016.",
        "These forecasts assume that the three-month Libor will remain at zero over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc will weaken.",
        "Global economic developments continue to be mixed.",
        "The US, UK and China all saw robust growth in the third quarter.",
        "In the euro area and Japan, by contrast, it was weaker than expected.",
        "The SNB is assuming that global economic growth will gradually firm over the course of next year.",
        "The considerable fall in oil prices should be a contributory factor.",
        "However, the prospects for individual countries vary widely.",
        "While the US is likely to see favourable developments, the outlook for the euro area is very subdued.",
        "Overall, the global economic outlook is still dominated by downside risks – the most important of which are the continuing difficult conditions in the euro area and a possible escalation in geopolitical tensions.",
        "Following a weak second quarter, real GDP growth in Switzerland was unexpectedly favourable in the third.",
        "On the demand side, the increase was driven predominantly by goods exports.",
        "Momentum in equipment investment, by contrast, remained weak.",
        "In part, growth was also boosted by special factors.",
        "Moreover, utilisation of economic capacity continued to be unsatisfactory.",
        "It is likely that growth will once again be markedly lower in the fourth quarter.",
        "As a result of the comprehensive revision of the national accounts, the reported figures for previous quarters are higher, and therefore GDP growth for the current year should also be somewhat higher than assumed in September, by 1.5–2%.",
        "However, the underlying economic momentum has not changed.",
        "For next year, the SNB still expects to see GDP growth of about 2%.",
        "Thus, the underutilisation of economic capacity should decline only gradually.",
        "In the third quarter, mortgage lending growth weakened further.",
        "At the same time, real estate prices continued to rise.",
        "However, as in 2013, price momentum was weaker than in previous years.",

        "The inflation forecast for the coming quarters is actually slightly higher than in March, given the fact that inflation was somewhat higher in May than expected and the departure point for the forecast has moved upwards as a result.",
        "Nevertheless from mid-2015 onwards, inflation will be lower than forecast in the previous quarter.",
        "This is due to the modest global economic outlook and unexpectedly low inflation in the euro area.",
        "At 0.1%, the inflation forecast for the current year is 0.1 percentage points higher than in March.",
        "For 2015 and 2016, the new forecast – of 0.3% for 2015 and 0.9% for 2016 – is 0.1 percentage points lower, in each case, than at the previous monetary policy assessment.",

        "Nevertheless, production capacities are still not fully utilised overall.",
        "The SNB expects the moderate recovery to continue in the coming quarters.",
        "For 2014, it again expects a growth rate of around 2.0%.",
        "Downside risks remain substantial, however.",
        "Weaker global economic activity would also be detrimental to economic growth in Switzerland.",
        "The current geopolitical conflicts, pressure to consolidate public sector finances in the euro area, and structural problems in different countries might dampen the global recovery more seriously than expected.",
        "Since the major currency areas are in different phases of the monetary policy cycle, there is a danger of greater volatility in the financial and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Surveys of companies have shown that uncertainty about economic conditions has recently increased at home as well.",
        "Starting 30 June 2014, higher capital requirements for mortgage loans financing residential property in Switzerland will apply as a result of the increased sectoral countercyclical capital buffer (CCB).",

        "In the first quarter of 2015, the inflation forecast actually shows a slight increase in inflation, reflecting a base effect due to the rise in prices in the previous quarter.",
        "However, from mid-2015 onwards, inflation is set to be lower.",
        "This is mainly due to the deterioration in the global economic outlook and slower growth in Switzerland.",
        "For the current year, the inflation forecast of 0.1% remains unchanged.",
        "The new forecast for 2015 of 0.2% is 0.1 percentage points lower than at the last monetary policy assessment, while the forecast for 2016 of 0.5% is even lower, namely by 0.4 percentage points.",
        "For Switzerland, the risk of deflation has thus increased again.",

        "In many of the emerging economies, too, growth was lacklustre.",
        "The SNB expects that the global economic recovery will be weaker in the approaching quarters than previously forecast.",
        "Economic developments in the US are still likely to drive growth, while in the euro area, growth looks set to remain modest.",
        "Furthermore, the global economic recovery remains vulnerable to setbacks.",
        "Geopolitical tensions could further weigh on corporate and consumer confidence.",
        "The consolidation of public finances, the implementation of reforms aimed at promoting growth and the completion of the assessment of banks’ balance sheets still pose significant challenges for the euro area.",
        "At an annualised rate of –0.2%, second-quarter GDP growth in Switzerland was distinctly lower than forecast in June.",
        "Despite having expected a rate of around 2% in June, given the current data, the SNB now puts this year’s growth rate at only just below 1.5%.",
        "Production capacity will therefore remain underutilised for longer than previously assumed, and the recovery on the labour market is also likely to be delayed.",
        "In the second quarter, mortgage lending again recorded slightly weaker growth.",

        "In Europe, growth was, geographically, broader-based than in previous quarters.",

        "Likewise, structural weaknesses in key emerging markets and political tensions in various regions could weigh on the global economic recovery.",
        "In Switzerland, as expected, the fourth quarter of 2013 saw a weakening of growth momentum, largely as a result of a decline in exports, which led to a corresponding decrease in value added in the manufacturing industry.",

        "This will increase banks’ resilience to a possible correction of imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets, and will counteract a further build-up of these imbalances.",

        "The higher commodity prices are likely to weigh on consumption and increase companies’ production costs.",
        "Foreign trade is also likely to be affected by the war, albeit not severely given Switzerland’s limited direct economic ties to Ukraine and Russia.",
        "Supply bottlenecks in the case of imported intermediate products could deteriorate further, and uncertainty could have an adverse impact on investment activity.",
        "In its baseline scenario for 2022, the SNB anticipates GDP growth of around 2.5%, this being lower than its previous forecast.",
        "In this scenario, growth is briefly subdued before rebounding, and unemployment is likely to decline further somewhat.",
        "It is difficult to assess the future course of the war and its economic impact.",
        "The forecasts for the global economy and for Switzerland are therefore subject to very high uncertainty.",
        "The risks to growth are considerable and to the downside.",
        "In particular, a further escalation of the war and a widening of the sanctions could weigh more heavily on economic activity worldwide and in Switzerland than assumed in the baseline scenario.",
        "At the same time, a worsening in the tight supply of raw materials could lead to a further rise in inflation globally.",
        "This would also increase the risk of inflation dynamics firming as a result of second-round effects.",
        "Added to this, a renewed deterioration in the pandemic situation cannot be ruled out.",
        "The momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has continued, and the vulnerabilities have increased further overall.",

        "The SNB is tightening its monetary policy further and is raising the SNB policy rate by 0.75 percentage points to 0.5%.",
        "In doing so, it is countering the renewed rise in inflationary pressure and the spread of inflation to goods and services that have so far been less affected.",

        "In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB expects only weak economic growth.",
        "In particular, the energy situation in Europe, the loss of purchasing power due to inflation, and tighter financing conditions are having a dampening effect.",
        "Inflation will remain elevated for the time being.",
        "However, the importance of temporary factors such as supply bottlenecks is likely to diminish over the medium term.",
        "The increasingly tighter monetary policy in many countries should also help inflation gradually return to more moderate levels.",

        "In Switzerland, GDP growth in the second quarter was lower than expected, at 1.1%.",

        "From mid-2023 onwards, the new forecast is higher and stands at 2.1% at the end of the forecast horizon.",
        "That the new forecast is higher over the medium term despite the raising of the SNB policy rate is attributable to stronger inflationary pressure from abroad and the fact that price increases are spreading across the various categories of goods and services in the consumer price index.",

        "Global economic growth has slowed markedly recently.",
        "This slowdown is on the one hand attributable to the high level of inflation, which is weighing on purchasing power and thus reducing demand.",

        "Since March, there has been a further considerable and broad-based increase in inflation in many countries.",
        "The war in Ukraine has been a significant factor here, too, in that the prices of many commodities have risen as a result.",
        "In addition, persisting supply bottlenecks have led to further price increases for various goods.",
        "In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB assumes that energy prices will remain high for the time being, but that there will not be an acute energy shortage in the major economic areas.",
        "The positive development of the economy should thus continue overall.",

        "For 2022, the SNB still anticipates GDP growth of around 2.5%.",
        "Unemployment is likely to remain low.",
        "This favourable forecast is based, among other things, on the assumption that the global economy continues to grow and that the war in Ukraine does not escalate further.",
        "The forecast for Switzerland, as for the global economy, is subject to large risks.",

        "Second, the SNB now predicts a less marked drop in inflation in the US and Europe next year than it had expected three months ago.",
        "Turning to Switzerland, economic developments in recent months have been in line with SNB expectations.",
        "In the second quarter of the year, real GDP growth was slightly below its medium-term potential.",
        "The slowdown in financial activity continues to weigh upon growth.",
        "Manufacturing and construction, however, are recording a more substantial decrease, although in most cases the initial point of departure was a very high level of activity.",
        "Therefore, even though capacity utilisation rates have fallen slightly and staff shortages have become less acute, it is still true to say that capacity utilisation remains at levels above the historical norm.",
        "For the second half of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, the SNB forecasts a continuation of the economic downturn.",
        "Consequently, the positive output gap should gradually close.",
        "The SNB is leaving its forecast of real GDP growth of between 1.5% and 2% for 2008 unchanged.",
        "Following the upward revision in the level of GDP for 2007, it is more likely that the final growth figure for 2008 will be located in the upper part of this range.",
        "Monetary conditions are almost unchanged as compared to the situation at the June assessment.",
        "Despite the turbulence in the financial markets, the Swiss franc has remained relatively stable.",
        "The yield on Confederation bonds – largely determined by interest rate movements in international financial markets – have fallen for all maturities, reflecting the deterioration in the global economic outlook and the heavy demand for the highestquality securities.",
        "Risk premia on interbank markets remain high because of the financial crisis.",
        "The SNB’s choice of the three-month Libor as the objective it aims to stabilise, rather than the rate for secured interbank loans, means, however, that it continues to shield the Swiss economy to a very considerable extent from the fluctuations in these premia.",
        "At present, the financial crisis has not had any impact on the granting of domestic loans.",
        "The rate of growth of mortgage loans attained 3.6% in July.",
        "However, as is generally the case towards the end of a business cycle, the rate of growth of other loans – particularly that of unsecured loans – appears to be slowing.",
        "Turning now to lending standards, a survey of 20 banks representing 85% of the domestic credit market, which was conducted by the SNB in July, confirmed that the sub-prime crisis has not led to a deterioration in 18 September 2008 3 credit conditions in Switzerland.",
        "These results differ from those obtained in similar surveys in the US and the euro area.",
        "Since the beginning of 2006, growth rates of the monetary aggregates have been moderate or even negative, which also means that low inflation rates can be expected in the medium and long term.",
        "Since December, inflation has been above the 2% mark.",
        "The fact that the economy was operating at very high capacity levels last year facilitated the pass-through of oil price rises to consumer prices.",
        "The fall in oil prices since July has not yet triggered a substantial drop in the rate of inflation, which amounted to 2.9% in August, after reaching 3.1% in July.",
        "The outlook with respect to inflation remains essentially unchanged.",
        "Inflation is likely to continue retreating next year, due to the fall in oil prices in recent months and the forecast slowdown in economic activity.",
        "Thus, the current level of inflation is of a temporary nature.",
        "The changes made to the inflation forecast since the June assessment represent, in essence, a technical update.",
        "Forecast inflation is slightly higher and more persistent, but the medium-term outlook remains essentially the same.",
        "This inflation forecast involves particular uncertainties.",
        "These relate mainly to the assumptions on the outlook for the international economy.",
        "Moreover, it is difficult to estimate the extent, duration and impact of the international financial crisis.",
        "Finally, it is not possible to precisely assess how inflation will react to the economic slowdown.",
        "Due to the high level of demand, the fact that productive resources are currently fully employed, and the continuing high cost of commodities and primary products, there is a risk that inflation could decline less rapidly than currently forecast.",
        "The inflation forecast shows that the rate of inflation will drop below the 2% mark in 2009.",
        "The current level of inflation is no more than transitory, since the expected economic slowdown will exert a moderating effect and the impact of the rise in oil prices will ease off gradually over time.",
        "Consequently, medium-term price stability is ensured.",
        "Moreover, in view of the major uncertainties relating to both the global economy and the fallout from the international financial crisis, the SNB considers that a prudent attitude is appropriate and that the current monetary policy course should be retained.",
        "Nevertheless, the high level of inflation at present requires that the SNB remain vigilant.",
        "A renewed rise in energy prices, a stronger economy than expected, a weakening of the Swiss franc or an increase in inflation expectations could all threaten medium-term price stability.",
        "Conversely, the financial crisis could cause a more marked slowdown in the economy, thereby reducing inflationary pressure.",
        "The SNB will therefore continue to keep a close watch on these factors, so as to be able to react quickly should the need arise.",
        "The new inflation forecast (dashed red curve on the chart) covers the period from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011.",
        "Like the previous forecast (dashdotted green curve), it is based on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75%.",
        "The new forecast indicates that, in the near future, inflation will be slightly more persistent.",
        "It will remain above the 2% level until the second quarter of next year.",
        "Essentially, this overshooting is due to the previous increases in oil prices and the continued high level of economic activity.",
        "However, the forecast shows that the slowing of the economy, the recent fall in oil prices and the associated basis effect will contribute to a drop in inflation in the next few months; it should return to a level compatible with medium-term price stability in 2009."

        "The value of the Swiss franc has increased substantially since the beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007.",
        "This currency development has gained momentum since the National Bank's last assessment in December.",
        "Under the present circumstances, this represents an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions.",
        "In view of this development, the SNB has decided to purchase foreign currency on the foreign exchange market, to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.",
        "While M1 and M2 are registering strong growth rates, that of M3 remains moderate.",
        "In contrast, the monetary base almost doubled in one year.",
        "This development reflected the SNB’s efforts to provide the interbank market with sufficient liquidity – as a response to the huge increase in the demand for liquidity brought about by the prevailing climate of uncertainty.",
        "If this demand had not been satisfied, the result would have been an undesirable rise in interest rates.",
        "Since the beginning of 2008, the SNB has been conducting a qualitative survey with twenty banks which make up the bulk of the domestic loan market.",
        "The survey carried out in January 2009 shows that some banks have tightened their lending conditions slightly.",
        "Moreover, a growing number of banks are expecting to do so in the near future.",
        "While the statistics confirm lower growth in overall lending, they do not show an actual decline.",
        "Mortgage lending has remained unaffected by this development.",
        "The rate of growth in this area has risen since November, reaching 3.8% in January.",
        "It is too soon to tell whether this is an effect linked to the lowering of the three-month Libor, as has been observed in the past.",
        "By contrast, the growth rate in other loans has dropped sharply.",
        "It stood at 5.8% in January, compared with 20% a year earlier.",
        "In this category, lending is strongly cyclical and related to developments in the economy.",
        "The other loans, therefore, should decline in the near future.",
        "Overall, developments on the Swiss lending market have not followed the pattern observed abroad.",
        "After reaching a peak of 3.1% last July, inflation dropped back to 0.2% in February.",
        "This is attributable to the spectacular drop in the oil price from USD 145 to around USD 40 a barrel during the same period, as well as the appreciation of the Swiss franc.",
        "Inflation will continue to fall and will enter negative territory in the course of 2009.",
        "This is due to the prices of imported goods and services, in particular oil.",
        "They will be lower this year 12 March 2009 4 compared with last year’s elevated levels.",
        "By contrast, inflation in domestic goods and services, despite weakening during the year, will remain positive in 2009.",
        "For 2010 and 2011, inflation will remain very close to zero, because output will be below potential and unemployment will be high.",
        "Should the economy deteriorate more severely than expected, there would be a risk of negative inflation.",
        "A prolonged period of negative inflation is not compatible with the objective of maintaining medium-term price stability.",
        "Any tightening of monetary conditions is inappropriate in this depressed environment.",

        "to around 0.25%, and by acting to prevent a further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro, the SNB is pursuing its expansionary monetary policy in order to support economic activity and limit the risk of deflation.",
        "The temporary narrowing of the Libor target range, which now stands at 75 basis points compared with the usual 100 basis points, is due to the fact that a negative Libor is not technically possible.",
        "While the previous forecast (dash-dotted green curve) was based on the assumption that the three-month Libor would remain unchanged at 0.5%, the new curve is based on a Libor of 0.25%.",
        "It shows strongly negative inflation in 2009.",
        "This is, in essence, attributable to movements in the price of oil (base effect).",
        "In 2010 and 2011, inflation will remain very low, despite a Libor of 0.25%.",
        "This is due to the unfavourable economic outlook.",
        "Inflation will increase slightly at the end of 2011.",
        "This slight uptick in inflation is explained by the fact that a Libor of 0.25% does not represent an equilibrium level capable of guaranteeing price stability in the longer term.",
        "The Swiss National Bank is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy.",
        "The economic recovery, while certainly underway, nevertheless remains fragile.",
        "There is still considerable uncertainty over how the situation will develop.",

        "It is aiming to keep the Libor in the lower end of this range, i.e.",
        "It will continue to provide the economy with a generous supply of liquidity; however, its purchases of Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers will be discontinued.",

        "The inflation forecast remains more or less unchanged compared to the September forecast.",
        "Average annual inflation will amount to approximately –0.5% in 2009.",

        "Despite the emergence of some encouraging signs, the global economic situation remains unfavourable and further economic deterioration cannot be ruled out.",
        "In Switzerland, the economic situation is difficult; the risk of deflation has abated, but still remains a concern.",
        "Consequently, the SNB is leaving the Libor target range unchanged at 0–0.75%.",
        "It is still aiming to bring the Libor down to the lower part of the range, in other words, to around 0.25%.",

        "It expects real GDP to fall by between 2.5% and 3%.",
        "Real GDP will continue decreasing throughout this year, although the rate of decline will ease off and will gradually be transformed into rising rates during the course of next year.",
        "The inflation forecast remains almost unchanged by comparison with that published in March.",
        "Annual average inflation will be negative in 2009, at around –0.5%, mainly due to the fall in the price of commodities since 2008.",
        "Taking account of the effects of the expansionary monetary policy pursued for several months now, the SNB expects this trend to be reversed from the beginning of next year.",
        "Inflation will become slightly positive, amounting to 0.4% in 2010 and 0.3% in 2011.",
        "The outlook for inflation still necessitates a firmly expansionary monetary policy.",
        "Moreover, a not inconsiderable risk of deflation remains.",
        "For this reason, the SNB has decided to maintain the monetary policy adopted in March.",
        "In doing so it aims not only 18 June 2009 2 to check the risk of deflation but also to limit the risk of additional deterioration of the economic situation.",
        "The SNB continues to use an inflation forecast as its guide.",
        "In this way, it can ensure that the unconventional measures currently in force do not compromise medium and long-term price stability.",
        "The Swiss National Bank is maintaining the expansionary monetary policy which it initiated last March.",
        "Despite the recent increase in the number of encouraging economic signs, uncertainty as to future developments remains considerable.",
        "In these circumstances, the SNB is opting for caution and retaining its monetary policy unchanged.",
        "Consequently, the SNB is holding the Libor target range at 0–0.75%.",

        "In addition, it will continue to act decisively to prevent any appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.",
        "The global economy has improved over the past few months and the downturn in the Swiss economy has proved to be considerably less substantial than had been forecast in the second quarter.",
        "The SNB has therefore revised its GDP growth forecast for the current year.",
        "It now expects real GDP to fall by between 1.5% and 2%.",
        "Growth is likely to pick up again gradually during the months ahead.",
        "The inflation forecast is almost unchanged for 2009 but is slightly higher for the subsequent years.",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that developments in both the Swiss and the global economies are less negative than had been expected.",
        "Average annual inflation for 2009 will be negative, amounting to around –0.5%, and the SNB expects prices to increase by 0.6% in 2010 and 0.9% in 2011.",
        "This inflation forecast is associated with major risks.",
        "The recovery anticipated in the global economy may fail to materialise.",
        "Moreover, although the financial industry is well into the process of recovery, another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out.",
        "A risk of deflation therefore remains.",
        "Consequently, an immediate tightening of monetary conditions is not necessary.",
        "However, the inflation forecast shows that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without compromising medium and long-term price stability.",
        "In view of the uncertainties, the SNB is adopting a cautious approach and pursuing the expansionary monetary policy outlined last March.",
        "By continuing to use an inflation forecast as its guide, the SNB can ensure that the exceptional measures currently in force do not compromise medium and long-term price stability.",
        "The global economy has a strong impact on the Swiss economic outlook.",
        "Consequently, the SNB bases its inflation forecast on the most likely assumptions with respect to future developments in the global economy.",
        "Its current assumptions are based on growth rates that are slightly higher than those foreseen in June.",
        "Positive growth rates are expected before the end of the year, both in the US and in Europe.",
        "However, there are still major risks to global economic developments.",
        "The economic situation in Switzerland remains difficult.",
        "GDP contracted again in the second quarter.",
        "The rate of capacity utilisation continued to fall, particularly in manufacturing.",
        "Unemployment and short-time working shot up, while consumer confidence persisted at a low level.",
        "However, goods exports are likely to pick up in the next few months as the global economy recovers.",
        "The upturn in activity will affect the various export sectors in different ways.",
        "The demand for capital goods and consumer durables, in particular, is likely to remain modest.",
        "In the area of domestic demand, the combined softness in both private consumption and investment should result in a sluggish GDP.",
        "For 2009 as a whole, the SNB now expects GDP to fall less substantially (–1.5% to –2%, compared with –2.5% to –3% in June).",
        "There are two reasons for this revision: global economic growth has resumed more quickly than expected and, as early as the second quarter, the fall in Swiss GDP was less deep than anticipated.",
        "Nevertheless, the SNB still holds the view that the return to full capacity utilisation will be slower and more uncertain overall than is usually the case at the end of a recession.",
        "Monetary conditions remain extremely relaxed.",
        "The Libor has declined, in line with the SNB’s stated intention, which is to bring the Libor down gradually to the lower end of the target range.",
        "Yields on Swiss Confederation bonds have also fallen.",
        "For a ten-year term, the yield is around 2.2%.",
        "Risk premia on the capital market have dropped.",
        "The Swiss franc is stable in trade-weighted terms.",
        "It is also stable against the euro, which shows that the monetary policy measures taken last March were effective.",
        "However, the situation will remain tenuous as long as the level of financial uncertainty at the international level remains high.",
        "Consequently, the SNB will continue to act decisively to prevent any strengthening in the Swiss franc against the euro.",
        "17 September 2009 3 Developments in lending and money aggregates provide confirmation of the major relaxation in monetary conditions.",
        "In July, mortgage loans – which constitute 80% of all loans – increased by 4.6%.",
        "This rate had previously been falling, but began rising again after the SNB substantially lowered its Libor target range in November 2008.",
        "Most mortgage loans are construction loans.",
        "Loans other than mortgage loans, referred to as ‘other loans’, declined by 1.6% in July.",
        "This category of loans is reacting as it has in the past to a contraction in economic activity.",
        "The information obtained from the statistics is corroborated by the quarterly survey on lending conditions conducted by the SNB since the beginning of 2008 with the 20 most important banks in Switzerland.",
        "The survey shows that 40% of the banks questioned have slightly tightened their lending conditions.",
        "No credit crunch of any kind has been observed in the lending statistics, neither in the household lending figures nor in the data on lending to small and large companies.",
        "With the decline in the quality of certain borrowers during a recession and the contraction in economic activity, it is inevitable that a cyclical tightening of lending conditions, or even a fall in the amount outstanding, will occur.",
        "This kind of development cannot be likened to a rationing effect, since it is not due to an autonomous fall in supply.",
        "In the current circumstances, the SNB considers that it would not be appropriate for the public authorities to introduce new support measures in the credit market.",
        "The volume of central bank money has more than doubled since the beginning of the financial crisis, but has already fallen considerably in past months.",
        "This reflects the efforts of the SNB to provide the interbank market with sufficient liquidity as a response to the increased demand for liquidity which, for its part, was due to a climate in which financial sector agents had lost trust in one another.",
        "The amount of liquidity is significant, not just in the banking and financial industry but also in the household and corporate sectors.",
        "This is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of the monetary aggregates since the beginning of the year.",
        "The M3 aggregate, which was still increasing at a moderate rate at our last assessment in June, has begun to advance more rapidly.",
        "The SNB is keeping a close watch on movements in the monetary aggregates.",
        "For six months, inflation has been negative and core inflation is still declining.",
        "Given the economic outlook in March and June, the forecast was for a rate of inflation close to zero for 2010 and 2011.",
        "It was associated with a deflationary risk.",
        "The inflation forecast has now been revised slightly upwards and, as a result, the risk of deflation has somewhat abated.",
        "Nevertheless, two scenarios could provoke a resurgence of deflation if they were to materialise.",
        "First, the recent signs with regard to the development of the global economy have yet to be confirmed.",
        "The current improvement is being supported by certain factors whose impact is of limited duration, such as fiscal stimulus programmes and inventory depletion.",
        "In addition, the US has acted as a locomotive driving global economic growth because of its strong demand for imported goods.",
        "However, should US consumers step up the process of debt reduction, the country might no longer be in a position to maintain this role, particularly since there is no other source of domestic demand that could fill it.",
        "Second, the financial industry is in the midst of a period of recuperation.",
        "Central banks are still providing financial markets with a generous supply of liquidity.",
        "It is difficult to assess how the banking industry will be affected by the expected deterioration in the financial position of households and companies.",
        "The long-term inflation outlook has changed since the June assessment.",
        "The outlook now shows that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained for the next three years because price stability would be compromised in the long term.",
        "However, an immediate correction in monetary policy would be precipitate since the inflation outlook is associated with major downside risks.",
        "If these risks materialised, the threat of deflation could re-emerge.",
        "The uncertainties relate to the global economy and to the level of recovery within the financial industry.",
        "These factors have persuaded the SNB to opt for a cautious approach, and to adhere to its present monetary policy course for the time being.",
        "The new inflation forecast (dashed red curve on the chart) covers the period from the third quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2012.",

        "The new inflation forecast is almost unchanged for 2009 and 2010.",
        "The explanation for both the negative inflation in 2009 and the increase in prices at the beginning of 2010 is to be found in a base effect attributable to changes in energy prices.",
        "Until the end of 2009, oil prices are likely to be lower than those recorded one year previously.",
        "From the beginning of next year, this pattern should once again be reversed.",
        "In 2010, inflation will remain weak since production capacity will be under-utilised.",
        "The new forecast is based on the assumption that the gap between actual and potential output will close more rapidly than the SNB had been expecting as recently as June.",
        "As a result, inflation will be higher in 2011 and, particularly, in 2012, if the current expansionary monetary policy is maintained indefinitely.",
        "Consequently, inflation will exceed the 2% mark from the end of the forecasting period."

        "In June, the SNB had still been assuming higher growth.",
        "The downward revision is primarily attributable to the development of consumer-related industries such as the trade industry and hospitality, which performed less dynamically than expected.",

        "Pronounced economic declines are to be expected in the first half of 2020.",
        "The speed with which the global economy subsequently recovers will hinge on the combined impact of healthcare, fiscal and monetary policy measures.",
        "Against the backdrop of the spread of coronavirus, the short-term outlook has also worsened markedly for Switzerland.",
        "In December, the SNB had still expected growth of between 1.5% and 2% for 2020.",

        "As soon as the national and international containment measures can be lifted, economic activity is likely to return to normal, albeit gradually.",
        "Even under this assumption, however, GDP growth is likely to be negative for the year as a whole.",

        "Recent indicators show that this is again having a detrimental impact on economic activity.",
        "However, the effects can be expected to be smaller than in spring given that many countries have opted for less severe containment measures.",

        "This has resulted in a renewed deterioration in the economic outlook.",

        "The SNB expects that GDP will shrink by around 3% this year.",
        "At its monetary policy assessment in September, it had anticipated an even stronger decline.",
        "The revision is due to the fact that the decrease in GDP resulting from the first wave of the pandemic was not as substantial as originally expected.",
        "Developments going forward largely depend on how successfully the spread of the virus can be contained in Switzerland and abroad.",
        "The SNB’s assumption is that there will not be a significant easing in the containment measures in Switzerland until the spring.",

        "Various signals indicate that economic activity has picked up again somewhat since May with the loosening of containment measures.",
        "This positive development is likely to continue in the coming months.",
        "However, the SNB anticipates that, as abroad, there will be only a partial recovery for the time being, and GDP will not return quickly to its pre-crisis level.",
        "Overall, GDP is likely to contract by around 6% this year.",
        "This would be the strongest decline since the oil crisis in the 1970s.",

        "The projected inflation rate will persist at a higher level for some quarters.",

        "In the past two years the National Bank took decisive steps in response to declining economic growth and to the upward trend of the Swiss franc.",
        "Owing to the low inflationary pressure the National Bank has narrowed the target corridor for the three-month Libor by a total of 3.25 percentage points since March 2001.",
        "Interest rates were last lowered on 6 March of this year.",
        "The recovery of the global economy is likely to be delayed still further so that in Switzerland, too, any perceptible economic upswing can only be expected to materialise during the course of 2004.",
        "The National Bank is therefore maintaining its expansionary monetary policy and shall keep the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments low.",
        "This does not jeopardise price stability.",
        "Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25%, average annual inflation is expected to amount to 0.6% this year, 0.4% next year, and 1.2% in 2005.",
        "For 2003 the National Bank anticipates real economic activity to stagnate overall.",
        "The National Bank has not made any further change to its monetary policy in its assessment of 20 March 2003.",
        "It cut the target range for the three-month Libor by 0.5 percentage points to 0%-0.75% on 6 March 2003 and announced that the rate is to be kept in the lower part of the new target range, i.e.",
        "at 0.25%, for the time being.",
        "The temporary narrowing of the target band from 100 to 75 basis points was prompted by technical factors.",
        "After the outbreak of the Iraq conflict, the economic and political environment remains extremely uncertain.",
        "The economic recovery in Switzerland expected for 2003 may be delayed.",
        "Given this difficult situation, the National Bank wishes decisively to counter the tightening of monetary conditions that would arise from an appreciation of the Swiss franc.",
        "Low inflation has meant that the National Bank has been able to relax its monetary policy significantly over the last two years.",
        "Since March 2001, it has cut the target band for the three-month Libor rate in a total of seven stages by 3.25 percentage points to its current level.",
        "At the present time, this expansive monetary policy does not pose any risk to price stability in Switzerland.",
        "Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25%, average annual inflation is expected to lie between 0.7% and 1.9% in the next three years.",
        "The National Bank now anticipates that economic growth will be just under 1% for 2003.",
        "Despite a difficult climate worldwide, economic activity in Switzerland stabilised somewhat during the second half of 2002.",
        "After falling between the third quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, real gross domestic product has since been edging up again on a quarter-on-quarter basis.",
        "Nonetheless, the fourth quarter of 2002 saw growth flatten off once more compared with the third quarter of the year.",
        "Exports and consumer spending were the main stabilising factors.",
        "The economic situation in Switzerland remains tight, however, with growth staying below its potential level.",
        "The deterioration of the labour market is depressing consumer sentiment and disposable incomes.",
        "Incoming orders and the order backlog are still unsatisfactory, and there is insufficient capacity utilisation in the industrial and construction sectors.",
        "Capital spending remains in sharp decline.",
        "There must be a sustainable recovery in exports and investment activity before Switzerland can return to higher real growth, and this cannot be expected until the global economy begins to pick up.",
        "The Swiss economy will thus expand only moderately up to mid-2003 and will not begin to accelerate somewhat until after this point.",
        "The National Bank anticipates that real gross national product will increase by just under 1% in 2003 as a whole.",
        "Year-on-year inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, rose to 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2002 from 0.3% in the third quarter.",
        "In January and February 2003, it was 0.8% and 0.9% respectively.",
        "These fluctuations are due primarily to statistical effects.",
        "The core rate of inflation calculated by the National Bank (trimmed mean method), which is a reliable indicator of the inflation trend, has been around 1% for some time now.",
        "At the end of 2002, the National Bank decided in future to publish its inflation forecast every quarter.",
        "This March forecast is the first of these.",
        "The graph shows both the inflation forecast of December 2002 (the dotted green curve) and the forecast of March 2003, drawn up after the latest interest rate cut (red dashed curve).",
        "The National Bank's new inflation forecast is based on the assumption that growth in the US will pick up again from the second quarter of 2003 onward.",
        "The US economy is likely to grow more strongly in 2004 and again reach its potential output.",
        "In the EU, however, the recovery has been delayed, and growth rates of over 2% are not to be expected until 2004.",
        "Given the uncertain geopolitical situation, the price of oil is likely to fluctuate around USD 30 a barrel for some time yet, before coming back down to around USD 25 a barrel.",
        "Despite the most recent interest rate cut, the new forecast up to mid-2004 is virtually the same as that published at the end of last year.",
        "In the short term, inflation will be held back by the delayed economic recovery and the weakness of the US dollar.",
        "In the new forecast, however, inflation rises more markedly at the end of the forecasting horizon owing to the more expansionary monetary policy.",
        "With its latest interest rate cut, the National Bank relaxed its policy significantly again and responded once more to increasing uncertainty about economic trends.",
        "In this critical phase, the aim of the National Bank is to support economic recovery in Switzerland and keep the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments at a low level.",
        "As the risks are still pointing mainly downward, the National Bank intends to maintain its expansionary monetary policy.",
        "Under the current circumstances, it will endeavour to take decisive steps to counter a tightening of monetary conditions through the appreciation of the Swiss franc.",
        "In spite of the fact that money market rates are already very low, the National Bank still has effective instruments at its disposal.",
        "In particular, these include intervention on the foreign exchange market.",
        "At present, the National Bank's highly expansionary monetary policy – as reflected in extraordinarily low interest rates and strong growth in monetary aggregates – poses no threat to price stability.",
        "The latest forecast expects inflation to rise to over 2% in the second half of 2005, given a constant interest rate of 0.25%.",
        "The National Bank nonetheless believes that it still has sufficient time to make later adjustments to its monetary policy, and that it can keep inflation within the price stability range."

        "For the two following years, a further increase in exports, a rise in equipment investment, robust private consumption and sustained economic growth are anticipated.",

        "For the first time since the first quarter of 2003, the M3 money overhang again receded in the second quarter.",

        "Growth of real GDP compared with the previous quarter firmed in the last two quarters.",
        "The pickup of the global economy and low interest rates are having a positive impact on the Swiss economy.",
        "At the same time, upward pressure on the Swiss franc – with the exception of the exchange rate against the US dollar – has abated.",
        "Growth dynamism is currently mostly due to strong export demand and a robust increase in equipment investment.",
        "Economic recovery in Switzerland will probably continue to strengthen in the next few months, and growth should become more broad-based.",
        "In addition to a robust increase in exports and in equipment investment, private consumption, too, should continue to strengthen as a result of the more optimistic consumer sentiment.",
        "An improvement in the labour market, which is expected to set in starting in the middle of 2004, will help to achieve this.",

        "Annual inflation measured by the national consumer price index (inflation rate compared with the previous year) was very stable in the second half of 2003 and averaged 0.5%.",
        "In January 2004 inflation fell to 0.2%.",
        "This was primarily due to a sharp sales-induced decline in prices in the “clothing and shoes” goods category and to a statistical effect in the price development of oil products.",
        "At 0.1%, inflation remained very low in February.",
        "After having averaged 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2003, the core inflation rate calculated by the National Bank also dropped slightly to 0.4% in January.",

        "The assumptions on which the new forecast is based are only marginally different from those of the December forecast.",
        "This is because the global economy developed in line with expectations.",
        "Even though the expansion - driven by fiscal policy measures - has tapered off, economic development in the US is expected to be quite solid in the next three years.",
        "In Europe, compared with the December forecast, an earlier-than-expected economic recovery is assumed.",
        "As a result of the strong euro, growth dynamism is likely to be limited, however.",
        "Inflationary pressure from abroad will remain weak.",
        "Moreover, the forecast assumes that the oil price will again fall below USD 30 per barrel in the course of 2004.",
        "The new inflation forecast for the three-month Libor to remain unchanged at 0.25% for the next three years deviates only marginally from the December forecast The differences only apply to the short term and are attributable to statistical effects It must, however, be noted that, as always, the forecast is based on an unchanged three-month Libor rate, i.e.",
        "on the assumption that monetary policy will remain as expansive as now during the next three years.",
        "It is also important to understand that the uncertainty of the forecast increases with the length of the forecasting horizon.",
        "The National Bank has been conducting a highly expansionary monetary policy for over two years now.",
        "It has reacted rapidly and unequivocally to the deterioration in the economic situation and the upward pressure on the Swiss franc.",
        "This expansionary policy was possible because inflation prospects showed a very moderate trend during that time.",
        "Owing to favourable monetary conditions and the improved world economy, Swiss economic activity is gradually beginning to gain momentum again.",
        "There is still a certain degree of risk, however, as to the sustainability of the economic recovery.",
        "The National Bank does not wish to threaten the upswing by increasing interest rates too soon.",
        "It therefore adheres to its expansionary monetary policy.",
        "However, the National Bank cannot continue this policy for an indefinite period without jeopardising price stability.",
        "While the strong expansion of monetary aggregates can be partly explained by special effects, liquidity in the economy has risen significantly.",
        "The National Bank will keep a close watch on this development.",
        "It will have to adjust its policy once the signs of an economic recovery are fully confirmed."
