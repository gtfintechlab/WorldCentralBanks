The economy has remained relatively robust despite the deterioration in the world economy, but the slowdown is likely to continue over the months to come
The SNB is tightening its monetary policy further and is raising the SNB policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5
As the risks are still pointing mainly downward, the National Bank intends to maintain its expansionary monetary policy
It is projecting an inflation rate of 0.8 for 2016, compared with 0.5 in the December forecast
This will have a positive effect on the labour market
Inflation in many countries remains above central banks targets
At the same time, the inflation potential is modest within the short term
However, goods exports are likely to pick up in the next few months as the global economy recovers
The SNB is anticipating a continuation of the recovery
Higher-than-expected inflation at the beginning of the year and the higher forecast for the whole of 2008 are due to brisk demand on the goods, services and labour markets, the high level of capacity utilisation which facilitates the passing on of costs, the price of oil, raw materials and other goods and  finally  the delayed effects of the weak exchange rate in 2007
Real economic growth stabilised at the beginning of this year
The unemployment rate rose again slightly, despite a rise in employment
The Swiss National Bank is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
Growth dynamism continued to wane
The conditional forecast assumes that the three-month Libor remains at 0.75 over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc weakens
Average annual inflation will amount to 0.5 in 2009
The signs from the global economy remain mixed
The pace of economic growth could slow further in the third and fourth quarters in the wake of stagnating exports
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro and is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at 0.00.25
Likewise, structural weaknesses in key emerging markets and political tensions in various regions could weigh on the global economic recovery
In doing so, it is aiming to act decisively to counter an excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro, since an appreciation of this kind would result in an undesired tightening of monetary conditions
Most mortgage loans are construction loans
Accordingly, it will regularly reassess the need for an adjustment of the countercyclical capital buffer
The SNB therefore welcomes the latest revision of the self-regulation guidelines for banks in the area of investment properties, which enters into force in January 2020
Against this background, numerous central banks have tightened their monetary policy further, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the previous quarters
Since the intensification of the US mortgage crisis, yields on Confederation bonds have fallen significantly
The SNB continues to 14 March 2013 2 monitor the momentum on the domestic residential mortgage and real estate markets closely
Investment and exports are the main factors accounting for the slowdown, while consumption has continued to rise significantly
In so doing, it takes the overall currency situation into consideration
In Switzerland, the economy continued to develop favourably in the third quarter
The SNB is assuming that global economic growth will gradually firm over the course of next year
The forecast puts average annual inflation at 2.1 for 2023, 1.9 for 2024 and 1.6 for 2025 cf
The healthy economy in the neighbouring countries and exchange rate developments have been contributing factors
Interest on sight deposits held by banks at the SNB currently corresponds to the SNB policy rate and remains at 0.75
Year-on-year inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, dropped to 0.5 in the second quarter of 2003 from 1.0 in the first quarter
Despite the higher interest rate, the new forecast exceeds that of December 2005 until the end of the year
These factors will continue to hold back the global economy over the coming months
Since the indicators for the demand for labour are still at a high level, the rise in employment is likely to continue in the first part of 2008
For the current year, inflation is forecast at 1.1, a 0.1 percentage point rise on last quarter
Notwithstanding the interest rate increase, monetary policy remains expansionary
Inflationary pressure from abroad will remain weak
As of September, banks will therefore be required to provide more capital backing for residential mortgage loans in Switzerland
This is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of the monetary aggregates since the beginning of the year
Through to the second quarter of 2007, this curve is a little higher than for June
For the current year, the SNB continues to anticipate inflation of 0.9
Global economic growth was solid in the first quarter of 2024
Forecast uncertainties remain high and risks are still to the downside
At the same time, the SNB will remain active in the foreign exchange market, in order to influence exchange rate developments where necessary
Economic indicators are currently pointing to moderately positive momentum
The global economic environment has sharply deteriorated over the past few months
The revision is due to the fact that the decrease in GDP resulting from the first wave of the pandemic was not as substantial as originally expected
After having passed its peak in the first half of 2008, inflation is likely to stabilise below 2
The current solid growth momentum is thus expected to continue in the coming quarters
The Swiss National Bank SNB is leaving the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro unchanged
Banks sight deposits held at the SNB will be remunerated at the SNB policy rate of 1.5 up to a certain threshold
The temporary narrowing of the Libor target range, which now stands at 75 basis points compared with the usual 100 basis points, is due to the fact that a negative Libor is not technically possible
11 March 2010 2 Developments in the global economy are largely as expected
Overall, the new conditional inflation forecast differs little from that of September
The significant tightening of monetary policy over recent quarters is countering remaining inflationary pressure
As in the past, it shall keep all its options open
However, it is likely that global production capacity will be underutilised for some time to come and inflation will remain modest in most countries
This is because the utilisation of resources is somewhat higher
In many advanced economies, inflation moved into negative territory at the beginning of 2015
Given favourable economic developments internationally, the outlook for Switzerlands economy is cautiously optimistic
If a deflation threat emerges, the SNB would take the measures necessary to ensure price stability
Nevertheless, there are significant risks to this positive baseline scenario, primarily in connection with political uncertainties and protectionist tendencies
The SNB has revised its June assumptions in two areas
It has gained further momentum and is becoming increasingly broadbased
In the final months of 2009, short-time work declined slightly, and unemployment did not rise any further
That said, the economy has lost momentum again somewhat of late
Following two quarters during which exports fell substantially, the fourth quarter again recorded slight growth compared with the third quarter of 2001
By continuing to use an inflation forecast as its guide, the SNB can ensure that the exceptional measures currently in force do not compromise medium and long-term price stability
The SNB will continue to monitor the situation closely
Owing to the favourable sales trend in all the major markets, exports should rise again in 2006, albeit at a slower rate than previously
Bern, 13 June 2003 The National Bank has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.0-0.75
The labour market remained robust, and overall production capacity has been well utilised
Utilisation of the economys output capacities is expected to improve steadily
Inflationary pressures have increased since December 2007
In addition to the expected progress with vaccination programmes, the monetary and fiscal policy measures introduced worldwide are an important source of support
The temporary narrowing of the target band from 100 to 75 basis points was prompted by technical factors
In addition, the continuing strong momentum on Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets poses risks for financial stability over the medium term
In the coming year, it expects the economy to expand by 1.5 to 2
On a trade-weighted basis, the Swiss franc is 1 For detailed information, please see Thomas Jordans introductory remarks to the news conference on 13 June 2019 at 10.00 am CET
An improvement in the labour market is expected only in the course of 2004
Growth in lending has increasingly switched to other loans, and these have recorded more powerful expansion, at 11, than at the beginning of the upswing of the years 19992000
In addition, the SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at 0.00.25
The slower pace of global economic growth was also felt in Switzerland, with the first official GDP estimate indicating stagnation in the third quarter
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy, with the aim of stabilising price developments and supporting economic activity
The SNB is authorised to debit the account without prior notice
The inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain steady at 0.5
At an annualised rate of 0.2, second-quarter GDP growth in Switzerland was distinctly lower than forecast in June
The European economy has also undergone a significant contraction
It remains prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities for this purpose
As in the past, the National Bank would lead a determined fight against an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions caused by a possible marked appreciation of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the euro
All in all, the National Bank is expecting a moderate decline in real economic activity for 2003
The National Banks inflation forecasts are embedded in a scenario for the global economy, which  according to the SNBs assessment  represents the most likely development
While the statistics confirm lower growth in overall lending, they do not show an actual decline
Chief among them are still political uncertainty and trade tensions, which could lead to renewed turbulence on the financial markets and a further dampening of economic sentiment
The Swiss franc is stable in trade-weighted terms
However, uncertainties regarding the upswing persist
In this environment, unemployment should continue to rise slightly, while the utilisation of production capacity is likely to decline slightly
Another risk is that the European economy might perform below expectations
Private consumption has picked up noticeably, somewhat exceeding the long-term average
Equally, it cannot be ruled out that inflation will remain elevated for longer in some countries
The Swiss National Bank is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy, thereby stabilising price developments and supporting economic activity
Economic activity in Switzerland is developing in line with the National Banks expectations
The improvement in the inflation outlook has provided room for manoeuvre which the SNB is decisively using
However, the downturn in the international economy and the measures to contain the virus will lead to a marked decline in economic activity in Switzerland as well in the first half of the year
The inflation forecast, which was based on a Libor of 1.0, pointed to an increase in inflation in the longer term
This is mainly due to the fact that developments in both the Swiss and the global economies are less negative than had been expected
In the emerging economies, performance remained uneven, while growth continued to cool in China
After that, the new curve is lower, with inflation stabilising at a level of 1.4
In Switzerland, GDP rose slightly in the second quarter, after having declined somewhat in the previous quarter
In this environment, unemployment will probably rise slightly, and the utilisation of production capacity is likely to decline somewhat
In its baseline scenario, the SNB continues to anticipate favourable developments in the global economy for the quarters ahead
In the EU, however, the recovery has been delayed, and growth rates of over 2 are not to be expected until 2004
With the expansionary monetary policy remaining unchanged, the high degree of utilisation of economic resources triggers an increase in inflation towards the end of 2006
A slowdown in GDP momentum was to be expected after several very strong quarters
The SNB policy rate change applies from tomorrow, 16 December 2022
At the end of the year, GDP and employment were still significantly below precrisis levels in most countries
However, a more extensive analysis of the available economic indicators points to an ongoing moderate recovery in the final months of the year; developments on the labour market support this view
Moreover, a growing number of banks are expecting to do so in the near future
These forecasts assume that the three-month Libor will remain at zero over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc will weaken
The outlook for the advanced economies, in particular, has worsened considerably
The SNB now anticipates slightly lower GDP growth of around 2.5 for 2018 as a whole
Taking into account the inflation differential between Switzerland and its trading partners, the real effective exchange rate of the Swiss franc has returned to the level of 2006
Even at the current rate, the Swiss franc is still high
This scenario for the global economy is still subject to significant risks
The favourable outlook for the labour market should continue to impact positively on income and consumption, and corporate investments are set to advance further
The Swiss National Bank SNB is raising the target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 1.252.25
It will have to adjust its policy once the signs of an economic recovery are fully confirmed
Since December, the three-month Libor has remained virtually unchanged within the lower part of the target range
For the time being, it intends to keep the rate in the middle of the target range at around 0.75
Imported goods and services in particular contributed to the decline
Once the dampening effect on inflation emanating from the decline in oil prices in the second half of 2006 has waned, we will witness an increase in annual inflation starting in the middle of 2007
In the US, the recovery remained hesitant and in China, economic activity lost strength
Developments in the Swiss economy are in line with the SNBs expectations
The SNB continues to anticipate growth of just under 1 for 2015 as a whole
In its baseline scenario for Switzerland, the SNB anticipates a continuation of the economic recovery next year
While many service industries fared well, there was a renewed slight decline in value added in manufacturing
Annual inflation measured by the national consumer price index inflation rate compared with the previous year was very stable in the second half of 2003 and averaged 0.5
It is also important to understand that the uncertainty of the forecast increases with the duration of the forecasting horizon
In Switzerland, the economic recovery has lost momentum since October 2020 in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic
On the one hand, the unexpectedly low rates of inflation for October and November are serving as a lower departure point for the forecast
Given the uncertain geopolitical situation, the price of oil is likely to fluctuate around USD 30 a barrel for some time yet, before coming back down to around USD 25 a barrel
Since monetary policy has been expansionary for a long time now, the inflationary risk will intensify in the future
Positive business expectations suggest favourable developments in the economy in the coming months, even though stagnating goods exports indicate that growth will slow during the course of the year
The National Bank is therefore maintaining its expansionary monetary policy and will keep the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments low
The conditional inflation forecast is associated with a very high level of uncertainty
The SNB expects a rise of around 1.5 in GDP for the coming year
The moderate inflation rate is due mainly to declining prices for foreign goods, notably for oil products
The National Banks inflation forecasts are embedded in a worldwide economic scenario
The low point in terms of economic activity came in April
Nevertheless, momentum is likely to be weak in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021
The CRF and the loans guaranteed by the federal government have together contributed significantly towards ensuring the supply of credit and liquidity to the economy
However, the importance of temporary factors such as supply bottlenecks is likely to diminish over the medium term
Given this weakening, appreciable underutilisation of production capacity may be expected in the short term
If necessary, it will take further measures immediately
During the past year, the National Bank has markedly eased its monetary policy, lowering the target range for the three-month Libor by a total of 1.75 percentage points
Economic growth in the US is unlikely to pick up speed before the spring of 2003; after that it should gradually regain its potential
Despite the turbulence in the financial markets, the Swiss franc has remained relatively stable
The National Bank has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.25 - 1.25
Although the US economy rebounded in the second quarter following a weather-related winter slump, the major euro area economies experienced considerably weaker growth than expected, and inflation was again very low
The new forecast stands at 0.4 for 2021, and 0.6 for both 2022 and 2023
The labour market continues to be a mainstay of the economy
Inflation has risen slightly since the last monetary policy assessment, and stood at 1.4 in May
The SNBs baseline scenario for the global economy anticipates a phased easing of the containment measures in place in many countries over the course of the spring
Inflation measured by the national consumer price index CPI decreased from 1.5 in the second quarter 2001 to 0.4 in the fourth quarter 2001
The fourth quarter of 2008 saw a sharp slowdown in the world economy, which affected all countries simultaneously
Mortgage growth has remained largely unchanged
The second wave of the pandemic is also taking its toll on the labour market
Growth has remained largely unchanged in recent quarters for both mortgage lending and prices for single-family houses and privately owned apartments
The inflation forecast has now been revised slightly upwards and, as a result, the risk of deflation has somewhat abated
As in the previous quarter, the forecast is based on a three-month Libor of 0.0 over the next three years
Global economic growth was moderate in the second quarter of this year
The low interest rates are designed to continue keeping Swiss franc investments fairly unattractive
The SNBs expansionary monetary policy is aimed at stabilising price developments and supporting economic activity
For 2016, the inflation forecast remains unchanged at 0.4
At the same time, the SNB will remain active in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration
The inflation potential, however, will remain modest within the short term
On the other hand, given the high level of capacity utilisation and movements in the exchange rate, there is a danger that higher production costs will increasingly be passed on to prices
Provided the economic recovery is substantiated, the SNB will adjust the expansionary monetary policy it has pursued for a long time now
This is slightly stronger than the SNB had expected in September, the reason being that activity in certain service industries  such as hospitality  was more dynamic than was assumed at that time
For one thing, already in the current year, growth in the US will be higher than expected at the time and, consequently the production gap of the US economy is likely to close by the end of 2004 For another Europe will suffer should, according to the new forecast, amount to 0.5 in the current year, drop to 0.2 in 2004 and climb to 1.0 in 2005
By contrast, exports of goods and services stagnated
This should guarantee price stability in the longer term
These higher prices for imports could impact upon consumer prices
The Swiss economy is also in a sharp recession
Subsequently, an acceleration will set in and forecast inflation will reach 2.8 in the second quarter of 2006
The cautiously optimistic baseline scenario continues to be subject to considerable downside risks; this is due to political uncertainty and structural problems in a number of advanced economies
In Switzerland, GDP grew at an annualised rate of 1.0 in the third quarter
The peak in inflation in the third quarter of 2011 is due to a base effect, because inflation in the third quarter of 2010 was comparatively low
In December, the SNB expected annual growth of some 2 for 2015
In the short term, inflation will dip into negative territory sooner, owing to the effects of the earlier currency appreciation, which have been stronger than expected
Thus, the underutilisation of economic capacity should decline only gradually
For 2013, the National Bank expects inflation of 0.1 and for 2014, 0.4
Exemption threshold Furthermore, under method 1, the threshold shall not be less than the basic minimum reserve requirement of the last RP
The global economy is expected to experience a robust recovery in the third quarter
As a result of the higher oil prices, the new forecast exceeds the June forecast until mid-2006
The conditional inflation forecast shows that there is no threat to price stability in the short term
Overall, inflation in Switzerland is currently being driven mainly by higher prices for domestic services
The forthcoming assessment of banks balance sheets in the euro area as well as the further course of monetary policy normalisation in the major currency areas could lead to noticeable spikes on international financial markets
Conversely, the financial crisis could cause a more marked slowdown in the economy, thereby reducing inflationary pressure
After that, it is significantly higher for the period of one year
Taking into account todays policy rate cut, the new conditional inflation forecast is similar to that of March
For 2022 as a whole, GDP grew by 2.1
Despite positive developments in the real economy, inflation remains modest in most advanced economies
Consumer price inflation edged down worldwide due to lower oil prices
If monetary policy were to remain unchanged until then, inflation rates would rise subsequently
Overall, global economic growth was solid in the first quarter
However, the inflation forecast shows that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without compromising medium and long-term price stability
Due to the favourable course of inflation, it was in this way able to react effectively to the decline in economic growth and the upward trends of the Swiss franc
In the second quarter 2018, GDP once again grew faster than estimated potential output, at an annualised rate of 2.9
Global economic growth was stronger than expected in the third quarter of this year
While the strong expansion of monetary aggregates can be partly explained by special effects, liquidity in the economy has risen significantly
While growth in mortgage lending remained relatively low in 2017, residential property prices rose again slightly
Unemployment rose somewhat, and the utilisation of overall production capacity was only slightly above average
Consequently, in order to ensure price stability in the long term, the SNB will probably have to continue its policy of interest rate normalisation
The last cut  by 0.5 percentage points  came on 7 December 2001
The forecast assumes that the three-month Libor will remain at 0.75 over the entire forecast horizon and that the Swiss franc will weaken further
In Switzerland, an analysis of the available economic indicators suggests that the moderate recovery is continuing
It is reminding them that in assessing the viability of carrying the debt burden the fact that interest rates are exceptionally low by historical standards must be taken into account
These factors have had an increasingly negative effect on both business and financial market sentiment in recent months
Should more external shocks occur, the danger of deflation cannot be entirely ruled out
The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly in recent months and the situation on international financial markets remains volatile
The economy in the US and Europe suffered a substantial decline in the first quarter
Overall, utilisation of total production capacity has improved further, and unemployment has also continued to decline over recent months
The Swiss National Bank SNB will maintain the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro and will enforce it with the utmost determination
Inflation prospects for 2006 are slightly less favourable than in the June forecast, but for 2007 they have remained virtually unchanged
Without todays SNB policy rate increase, the inflation forecast would be even higher over the medium term
At the same time, upward pressure on the Swiss franc  with the exception of the exchange rate against the US dollar  has abated
As from mid-2003 onwards, inflation will again develop in line with the forecast published in December
Subdued demand from abroad, the loss of purchasing power due to inflation, and more restrictive financial conditions are having a dampening effect
However, for the coming quarters the SNB expects only moderate growth in global economic activity by longer-term comparison
The forecast is based on the assumption that the SNB policy rate is 1.75 over the entire forecast horizon
The current level of inflation is no more than transitory, since the expected economic slowdown will exert a moderating effect and the impact of the rise in oil prices will ease off gradually over time
The recovery thus remains incomplete
It also remains to be seen how far the upcoming budget consolidation in the US will hamper growth
For 2020, it anticipates an inflation rate of 1.9
Growth is likely to pick up again gradually during the months ahead
For 2018, the SNB anticipates inflation of 0.4, compared to 0.5 in the previous quarter
The coronavirus pandemic and the measures implemented to contain it led to a historic downturn in the global economy in the first half of 2020
The forecast is based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0 over the next three years
To provide appropriate monetary conditions, the SNB is also willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary
Inflation has declined further since the beginning of the year, and stood at 1.2 in February
In Switzerland, fourth-quarter GDP growth was lower than expected
In addition, it is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at 0.00.25
Risk premia are now minimal; indeed, on occasion they have fallen even further
For the current year, the forecast has risen marginally to 0.4, from 0.3 in the previous quarter
The negative inflation rate in July is mainly attributable to a change in data collection on clearance sales prices for clothing
Compared to December, the new conditional inflation forecast is slightly higher for the next few quarters
Forecast inflation is slightly higher and more persistent, but the medium-term outlook remains essentially the same
Moreover, it assumes that the dollar will hover around its current level against the euro and that the oil price will be about  25 per barrel
This is the result of the weak economic growth in Switzerland, the generally moderate price pressure abroad and the expected decline in the oil price
The economic situation has deteriorated sharply since last December, and there is a risk of negative inflation over the next three years
This was mainly due to weaker performance in manufacturing
The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the global economy into a sharp recession
Capacity utilisation is thus on the rise and companies are also becoming increasingly willing to invest
The structural change underway in China could continue to hold back global manufacturing and investment activity
For 2016, the SNB expects growth of approximately 1.5
Finally, the coronavirus pandemic remains an important source of risk for the global economy
Towards the end of the forecast horizon, inflation rises briskly and exceeds the upper bound of 2, assuming that the three-month Libor remains at the current level
Consequently, the economy is progressing faster than its long-term average potential, with a high level of resource utilisation
Finally, the course of the coronavirus pandemic remains an important source of risk
In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB expects growth in the coming quarters to remain in line with potential
The new conditional forecast subsequently moves closer to that of the last quarter, and is in line with it from 2018
Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25, average inflation for 2010 is expected to amount to 0.7, for 2011 to 0.3 and for 2012 to 1.2
Moreover, seasonal and special effects  such as clearance sales prices for clothing  had a dampening influence on inflation
The economic recovery is therefore likely to regain momentum from the second quarter
At the same time, inflation continued to rise in the US and the euro area
Global economic growth has slowed markedly recently
While the service industries experienced mainly robust growth, value added in manufacturing declined
By raising the target range, the National Bank is ensuring that the inflation outlook will remain favourable
For 2013, the SNB anticipates an unchanged inflation rate of 0.2
The complex structural changes taking place in China could have negative repercussions for global demand
Moreover, they signalled that they would probably leave their policy rates at a low level for an extended period of time
The new conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the SNB policy rate is 1.75 over the entire forecast horizon cf
For 2024, the SNB currently expects growth of between 0.5 and 1
For 2012, the inflation rate will amount to 0.7
According to an initial quarterly estimate, GDP in Switzerland grew at an annualised rate of 0.2 in the third quarter
It is raising the target range for the three-month Libor by a further 25 basis points to 1.252.25
For the year as a whole, however, the Swiss economy grew by 3.7
The SNB will continue to monitor the development of inflation closely, and will adjust its monetary policy if necessary to ensure inflation remains within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term
Without todays rate cut, the forecast would have been lower
This is only because of the favourable economic development in the first half of the year
In the area of domestic demand, the combined softness in both private consumption and investment should result in a sluggish GDP
After a brief slowdown, growth in the emerging economies picked up again in the fourth quarter, particularly in Asia
Monetary policy was last adjusted on 22 March 2001, when the target range was lowered by 0.25 percentage points
In 2006, it would no longer be in the range that the National Bank equates with price stability
Unemployment registered another slight increase
However, this development is still fragile
In this case, the medium-term inflation forecast would have to be corrected downward
While GDP declined strongly in the second quarter, mortgage lending and residential property prices continued to rise
interest on sight deposit account balances
In so doing, it aims to cushion the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity and inflation
Stronger second-round effects and the fact that inflationary pressure from abroad has increased again mean that, despite the raising of the SNB policy rate, the new forecast is higher through to mid-2025 than in December
Moreover, not all industries have benefited equally from the recovery
The growth of the global economy has slowed substantially in the course of the second quarter
Internationally, however, growth was not broad-based
For 2017, the SNB continues to expect growth of roughly 1.5
The positive development of the economy should thus continue overall
Overall, the National Bank anticipates economic growth to be 1.5 - 2 for 2004
This level reflects both the healthy state of public finances and long-term inflation expectations, which are consistent with price stability
For 2010 and 2011, inflation will remain very close to zero, because output will be below potential and unemployment will be high
The trade-weighted external value of the Swiss franc has increased further, mainly as a result of the recent weakness of the euro
The inflation projection published after the interest rate increase in December 2006 was based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 2.00 green curve
It is also providing liquidity as part of the extended swap arrangements with other central banks, particularly in US dollars
Inflation could remain elevated for longer in some countries, necessitating a further tightening of monetary policy there
The SNB will continue to closely monitor developments in the global economy, in financial markets and in foreign exchange markets
Despite a considerable easing of tensions on the international financial markets, global economic growth was rather weak in the fourth quarter
In particular, the high inflation in some countries could be more persistent than expected, necessitating a further tightening of monetary policy there
Assumptions on further international economic development have been somewhat modified compared with June 2005
The global economy has continued to recover in line with the SNBs expectations
A stronger economic downturn abroad or a pronounced energy shortage in Switzerland would, in particular, have a negative effect
The SNB expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters
Higher utilisation of technical production capacity is likely to strengthen investment activity and boost demand for equipment goods
Overall, its assessment of global economic prospects is cautiously optimistic
Banks sight deposits held at the SNB will be remunerated at the SNB policy rate of 1.75 up to a certain threshold
With this tiered remuneration of sight deposits and open market operations, the SNB is ensuring that the secured short-term Swiss franc money market rates are close to the SNB policy rate
The Chinese economy, too, expanded robustly on the back of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures
The international environment has deteriorated since the last monetary policy assessment in December, and the impact of the crisis in the US real estate market is worsening
Under the current circumstances, it will endeavour to take decisive steps to counter a tightening of monetary conditions through the appreciation of the Swiss franc
The monetary policy easing is likely to contribute to the economy  and thus also inflation  picking up again over the medium term
Unemployment is likely to rise again, and production factors will remain underutilised for some time yet
In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB assumes that energy prices will remain high for the time being, but that there will be no acute energy shortages in the major economic areas
In the short term, this is due to the recent lower-than-expected inflation
The Swiss National Bank SNB is raising the target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 0.751.75
The SNBs baseline scenario anticipates that the containment measures in Switzerland will be eased further in the coming months, and that there will be no renewed worsening of the pandemic situation and tightening of the measures thereafter
If global activity proves disappointing or the turmoil on the financial markets increase, downside risks will again emerge for the economy and price stability in Switzerland
As regards the real estate market, price growth for single-family houses and privately owned apartments has slowed in recent quarters, while prices for apartment buildings have declined
The SNB expects that the rate of increase in mortgage loans will settle below the current level of 5
During the first half of the current year, the growth rate dropped back, after having reached 3.3 in 2007
Moreover, the forecast assumes that the oil price will again fall below USD 30 per barrel in the course of 2004
For 2019, the SNB now expects inflation of 0.9, compared to 1.1 last quarter
Nonetheless, uncertainty about the future development of the global economy remains high
This small increase must also be seen in the context of high growth in the second quarter
The National Bank anticipates economic growth of a little over 2.0 for Switzerland this year, which corresponds to the December forecast
The SNB is keeping a close watch on movements in the monetary aggregates
Nevertheless, GDP remained significantly below pre-crisis levels in most countries
On the other, the decline in inflation in the euro area and the slight fall in the oil price are also helping to dampen the inflation outlook
The situation on the labour market is not likely to undergo any sustained changes, and the unemployment rate should rise only slightly
Global economic growth was weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2015, and this development had a detrimental impact on world trade
While, on the one hand, structural changes in the economy are having more of a dampening effect on prices, the high level of utilisation of resources and exchange rate movements, on the other, are exacerbating the risk of higher production costs being increasingly passed on to prices
Sight deposits above this threshold will be remunerated at an interest rate of 1.0, and thus still at a discount of 0.5 percentage points relative to the SNB policy rate
That the new forecast is higher over the medium term despite the raising of the SNB policy rate is attributable to stronger inflationary pressure from abroad and the fact that price increases are spreading across the various categories of goods and services in the consumer price index
This would be the strongest decline since the oil crisis in the 1970s
The central Federal Administration and the compensation funds for old age and survivors insurance, disability insurance and the fund for loss of earned income compenswiss are currently exempted
They continue to curb the international economy and exert inflationary pressure
Exports have surged, boosted in particular by demand from Europe, with equipment goods and semi-manufactures being especially favoured
The growth in mortgage lending and real estate prices has decelerated marginally, compared to the situation at the end of 2009
The dashed red curve on the chart represents the new conditional inflation forecast
An appreciation of the Swiss franc would compromise price stability and would have serious consequences for the Swiss economy
The SNBs conditional inflation forecast has been adjusted downwards appreciably over the entire forecast period compared to the previous quarter
In the US, GDP declined slightly
For 2019, it now expects inflation of 1.1, compared to 1.0 last quarter
In Switzerland, GDP growth in the second quarter exceeded expectations
Weaker global economic activity would also be detrimental to economic growth in Switzerland
However, it has continued to decline in recent months
There is a great deal of uncertainty, however, regarding the extent and the duration of this effect
The National Bank is aware of the fact that the expansive monetary policy it has been pursuing for a considerable period of time has a strong impact on the real estate sector
In the longer term, the inflation forecast is virtually unchanged compared with September
Although inflation declined again in many countries, it remains clearly above central banks targets
It has reacted rapidly and unequivocally to the deterioration in the economic situation and the upward pressure on the Swiss franc
Inflation in Switzerland was close to 0 for January and February
This scenario for the global economy is still subject to large risks
Consequently, for 2007 as a whole, GDP growth came to 3.1
It is evident from the inflation dynamics, however, that a three-month Libor of 1.25 is still not sufficient to guarantee price stability in the longer term
With a view to further increasing the banks room for manoeuvre, the SNB is examining whether a relaxation of the countercyclical capital buffer would be possible despite the risks on the mortgage and real estate markets
The development of prices in the middle of the three-year forecasting horizon is primarily determined by economic performance
For 2015, forecast inflation will even turn negative, at 0.1
In these exceptional circumstances, the SNBs expansionary monetary policy is more necessary than ever for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions in Switzerland
Restrictions on public movement, interruptions in production, supply chain disruptions and curbed household consumption will weigh heavily on economic activity in all affected countries
Inflation will increase slightly at the end of 2011
It is therefore still clearly above the range the SNB equates with price stability
This situation is likely to ease over the medium term, however, with inflation abroad dropping back to more moderate levels
Like the June forecast dash-dotted green line, it is based on the assumption of the threemonth Libor rate remaining constant at 0.75
In the wake of this development, capacity utilisation in the economy as a whole improved further
This inflation outlook calls for decisive action on the part of the SNB
Unless otherwise specified, a change in the threshold factor will apply as of the beginning of the subsequent interest period
On the other hand, the economic policy measures introduced since the outbreak of the pandemic could support the recovery more strongly than anticipated in the baseline scenario
The core inflation rate calculated by the National Bank currently amounts to 0.7
Since the SNB no longer has any room for manoeuvre, the SNB has been intervening in the foreign exchange market
Growth prospects are being dampened by the euro area crisis, on the one hand, and the uncertainty surrounding forthcoming fiscal policy decisions in the US, on the other
Despite the emergence of some encouraging signs, the global economic situation remains unfavourable and further economic deterioration cannot be ruled out
Renewed turbulence in the international financial markets could have a major impact on global monetary policy
The SNB expects that GDP will shrink by around 3 this year
Bridging loans can prevent liquidity shortfalls caused by the crisis from leading to insolvencies
In the second quarter, real GDP rose at an annualised rate of 3.0, as compared with the previous quarter
The SNB is targeting a three-month Libor of around 2.75, after this rate has climbed as high as 2.9
In the emerging economies, too, economic activity was positive overall
The Swiss franc is highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile
Various signals indicate that economic activity has picked up again somewhat since May with the loosening of containment measures
Over the medium term, however, inflation abroad should return to more moderate levels, not least due to the increasingly tighter monetary policy in many countries
In addition to supply chain problems, higher energy prices also played an important role in this respect
In the same month, the growth rate of M3 was 6.1 as compared to 7.9 in November
The SNBs monetary policy thus remains as expansionary as before
In its baseline scenario for 2022, the SNB anticipates GDP growth of around 2.5, this being lower than its previous forecast
Real economic activity should pick up once more in the second half-year, underpinned by a recovery in exports
The conditions for a stimulation of employment and private consumption are thus fulfilled
Economic recovery is also underway in Switzerland
For 2013, the SNB expects growth of 1.01.5
In Switzerland, real GDP in the third quarter increased again following a temporary downturn
According to the initial estimate, the Swiss economy grew by 1.6 in the third quarter
Loans other than mortgage loans, referred to as other loans, declined by 1.6 in July
Thus far, the war in Ukraine has had an effect on the Swiss economy above all via the strong increase in commodity prices
This is prompting the SNB to purchase Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers in order to bring about a relaxation of conditions on the capital markets
The second interest rate rise by 25 basis points now announced will reverse the interest rate cut of March 2003, which was made under extraordinary circumstances
Given this difficult situation, the National Bank wishes decisively to counter the tightening of monetary conditions that would arise from an appreciation of the Swiss franc
However, the underlying inflationary pressure continued to decrease slightly
In many emerging economies, too, economic activity was rather sluggish
A close examination of a broad range of indicators leads to a somewhat more positive assessment of the economy
The SNB survey of lending operations showed that, in the second quarter of 2010, the slight tightening of lending conditions during the crisis for corporate loans was eased a little  a development that had already been observed in the previous quarter
The banks have built up substantial capital and liquidity buffers in recent years
Unemployment will rise further this year
However, these loans are still below the level they had reached at the beginning of the boom years of 19992000
In its baseline scenario for Switzerland, the SNB anticipates a continuation of the economic recovery
The higher commodity prices are likely to weigh on consumption and increase companies production costs
Over the coming months, the global economic recovery is likely to lead to a gradual upturn in demand for Swiss products; this will cushion the impact of the exchange rate shock somewhat
It cut the target range for the three-month Libor by 0.5 percentage points to 0-0.75 on 6 March 2003 and announced that the rate is to be kept in the lower part of the new target range, i.e
If required, the SNB will take further measures immediately
For 2020, the SNB expects to see inflation of 1.2, compared with the 1.6 forecast in the last quarter
In the second quarter, the Swiss economy posted growth of 2.5 on an annualised basis
In this way, the SNB stabilises price developments and supports economic activity
In addition, the impact which past appreciation of the Swiss franc is having on the price level is rather stronger than had originally been expected
Consequently, the SNB is holding the target range for the three-month Libor at 00.75
The National Bank anticipates average inflation for 2005 to remain at 1.2
The new conditional inflation forecast for the coming quarters is slightly lower than in September
In the advanced economies, GDP continued to expand above potential, in some cases exceeding expectations
From the second quarter of 2019, the new conditional forecast lies below the June forecast as a result of the appreciation in the Swiss franc
Next year, the economic trend is likely to continue favourable, albeit somewhat less pronounced
First, growth in the United States is more moderate than we were expecting in June
The declining trend of inflation is due mainly to the weakening of economic activity in Switzerland and abroad
The risks to this positive baseline scenario are more to the downside
Over the medium term, however, it should return to more moderate levels, not least due to more restrictive monetary policy
This phenomenon is likely to reverse in the first quarter of this year
This was followed by a strong recovery in the third quarter
Overall, international growth is principally being driven by domestic demand
The second quarter of 2010 saw a clear continuation of the recovery in manufacturing  the area which, in 2009, had been most seriously affected by the recession
In Switzerland, real gross domestic product declined again in line with expectations in the second quarter of 2003, and the situation on the labour market deteriorated further
For the cash holdings component, the corresponding ratio of the cash holdings is calculated
Despite these favourable developments, the outlook for the global economy is still uncertain
For 2020, we expect to see inflation of 1.6, compared with 1.9 forecast in the last quarter
Banks sight deposits held at the SNB are remunerated at the SNB policy rate up to a certain threshold, and at 1.25 above this threshold
Interest rates were last lowered on 26 July of this year
Compared with the December expectations, the recovery this year is likely to be delayed somewhat
Second, the financial industry is in the midst of a period of recuperation
For 2015, the SNB has revised its inflation forecast downwards by 1 percentage point to 1.1
Internationally declining inflation rates and the slightly stronger Swiss franc are delaying the rise of inflation into positive territory
The actual inflationary pressure is currently underestimated somewhat by the CPI
at 0.25, for the time being
In view of this development, the SNB has decided to purchase foreign currency on the foreign exchange market, to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro
After that, it is lower due to the now tighter monetary policy
Consequently, it is a conditional forecast
The war in Ukraine has been a significant factor here, too, in that the prices of many commodities have risen as a result
In its new baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB is revising down its growth forecast for the coming quarters
Consequently, no inflation risks can be identified for Switzerland in the foreseeable future
Real oil prices have reached their highest level in twenty years
This March forecast is the first of these
The Swiss economy expanded by 2.0 year-on-year in the second quarter of 2001
This kind of development cannot be likened to a rationing effect, since it is not due to an autonomous fall in supply
Overall production capacity has been well utilised
The risks for the Swiss economy remain high
For example, the energy situation could worsen again
The new conditional inflation forecast is below that of September
The war in Ukraine has thus far had comparatively little adverse impact on economic activity in Switzerland
Monetary conditions are characterised by two opposing trends
Price rises for foreign goods remain very low and also volatile due not least to the fluctuating oil price
With exports rising gradually, followed by an increase in equipment investment, the economic upswing in Switzerland should take hold next year
It will continue to provide the economy with a generous supply of liquidity; however, its purchases of Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers will be discontinued
It is still aiming to keep the Libor within the lower end of this range, i.e
The Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued
Essentially, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast is unchanged from its September forecast
On the assumption of an unchanged three-month Libor of 2.00, it expects annual inflation to reach 0.4 in 2007 and 0.9 in 2008
In view of the medium-term inflation outlook, it can afford to do so for the time being
The target range for the three-month Libor remains at between 1.25 and 0.25, and the interest rate on sight deposits with the SNB is unchanged at 0.75
Despite the recent increase in the number of encouraging economic signs, uncertainty as to future developments remains considerable
Annualised growth was down to 1.7 from the previous quarter, compared with 2.0 in the first quarter
Year-on-year inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, rose to 1.0 in the fourth quarter of 2002 from 0.3 in the third quarter
GDP shrank again in many countries in the first quarter, and remained significantly below pre-crisis levels
The international outlook continues to be highly uncertain
Given these conditions, the SNB is maintaining its cautious stance and leaving its monetary policy strategy unchanged
The National Bank now anticipates that economic growth will be just under 1 for 2003
The new conditional inflation forecast is significantly lower than that of December
The SNB policy rate change applies from tomorrow, 23 September 2022
For 2007, the National Bank projects growth in real gross domestic product of a little over 2.5
Not until 2017 will inflation move into positive territory again, at 0.4
Any tightening of monetary conditions is inappropriate in this depressed environment
Based on this scenario, economic resources should be fully utilised towards the end of 2006
The assumptions on which the new forecast is based differ in various respects from those in June
Although prices in the residential investment property segment have stabilised, there is the risk of a correction due to strong price increases in recent years and growing vacancy rates
Several factors are supporting this growth
At the same time, some risks have had to be weighted more heavily than in the December assessment
This adjustment to the calculation basis takes account of the fact that the low interest rate environment around the world has recently become more entrenched and could persist for some time yet
After stagnating in the second half of 2018, GDP growth is thus likely to pick up again somewhat
The situation varies considerably from one industry to another, however
At the same time, the global economy is likely to pick up somewhat
Over the entire forecast horizon, the inflation forecast is within the range of price stability cf
At the same time, inflation is likely to remain elevated worldwide for the time being
The target range for the three-month Libor will be left unchanged at 0.00.25
Owing to the economic growth, the labour market situation in advanced economies has improved in recent quarters
In the wake of this development, capacity utilisation in the economy as a whole increased further
Overall, the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued, despite a slight depreciation
The applicable interest rate on sight deposits is available at , Statistics, Reports and press releases, Interest rates and foreign exchange rates _current
The SNB is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75
The economic signals for the coming months remain favourable
This would have a dampening effect on the economy as well as on prices
According to the SNBs assessment, imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets persist
It is thus just within the range of price stability at the end of the forecast horizon
Interest rates were last lowered on 6 March of this year
The rapid deterioration in the economic situation and the decline in commodity prices have also led to a clear downward revision of the inflation forecast
In addition, because of strong demand, higher production costs could be passed on to prices more easily
For 2016 as a whole, it still anticipates real GDP growth of between 1 and 1.5
The Swiss economy continued to grow at a moderate rate in the second quarter
The lower oil and gas prices and the stronger Swiss franc are having a dampening effect over the short term
In its baseline scenario for global economic developments, the SNB anticipates solid growth in the coming quarters
This inflation forecast involves particular uncertainties
Growth was curbed in part by temporary factors
The new forecast stands at 2.1 for 2022, and 0.9 for 2023 and 2024 cf
International trade tensions and political uncertainty have weighed on the global economy in recent months
The positive development in the first half of the year was, however, partly due to special factors
Consequently, the SNB welcomes the Federal Council decision to make available a countercyclical capital buffer which can counter adverse developments on the domestic credit market
Its current assumptions are based on growth rates that are slightly higher than those foreseen in June
This slowdown is on the one hand attributable to the high level of inflation, which is weighing on purchasing power and thus reducing demand
Survey-based labour demand indicators have recovered further
Should the economy deteriorate more severely than expected, there would be a risk of negative inflation
Orders received and the order backlog in industry still fall short of the desired level, and demand for export goods continues to be modest
The survey carried out in January 2009 shows that some banks have tightened their lending conditions slightly
At the same time, the moderate pace of global growth should continue
Consequently, corporate bond conditions on the capital markets have become attractive
The SNB currently expects growth of around 1.5 for 2025
This is a reflection of the fact that the assessment of the inflation outlook has not changed significantly compared to the previous quarter
Both led to lower expectations regarding policy rates in the major currency areas
Despite the interest rate lift, monetary policy remains expansionary and supports the upswing
It is therefore keeping a close watch on this sector
As a result of the stronger growth momentum in the US and the emerging economies, the SNB revised its global growth assumptions upwards for 2011
In doing so, it is countering the renewed rise in inflationary pressure and the spread of inflation to goods and services that have so far been less affected
Moreover, public spending will play a countercyclical role
The National Bank considers the new interest rate level to be appropriate to ensure price stability in the medium term and to allow balanced economic growth
The increase in activity had a favourable impact on the labour market
Further cuts in the SNB policy rate may become necessary in the coming quarters to ensure price stability over the medium term
Notably, inflation in the private service sector has receded
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing pressure on the currency
For the time being, it intends to keep the three-month Libor rate in the middle of the target range at 0.75
A further escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis cannot be ruled out
Despite restrained momentum in recent quarters, imbalances on the mortgage and real estate market increased slightly due to comparatively weak growth in fundamentals
In the advanced economies, expansionary monetary policy and the robust situation on the labour market are lending support, as is fiscal policy in some countries
Over the medium term, however, it should return to more moderate levels, not least thanks to monetary policy and due to the economic slowdown
Particularly strong advances were recorded by retail and wholesale trade, the financial industry and construction
Global economic growth continued in the second quarter in line with the SNBs expectations
For 2020, the SNB expects inflation of 1.0, compared with its previous forecast of 1.2
In the second quarter of 2020, gross domestic product GDP was approximately 1020 below its end-2019 level in most countries
The economic recovery in Switzerland expected for 2003 may be delayed
The price of oil has risen again
The increased weight of fluctuating oil prices and the inclusion of clearance sales prices in the new national consumer price index tend to render inflation more volatile from one month to another
The resulting climate of uncertainty will prompt households to exercise more caution and will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending
However, if the uncertainty in the financial markets persists, it is conceivable that the momentum from abroad and the growth contribution from the domestic financial sector could be reduced
During the course of 2009, the new forecast drops below the previous one again
The National Bank is watching the expansion of liquidity carefully
Growth in Switzerland was robust in the third quarter of 2010, but the weakening of exports, in particular, points to a significant reduction in growth in the quarters ahead
There is no indication that price stability might be jeopardised in the medium term
However, following strong growth in the previous quarters, the pace is expected to slow slightly
The SNB inflation forecast maps the future development of prices on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged over the forecasting period
For this year, the National Bank continues to anticipate GDP growth to be close to 2
In essence, the reason why the forecast follows this path is because of past movements in oil prices baseline effects
Above all, the appreciably lower oil price will push inflation into negative territory during the next four quarters
The M3 aggregate, which was still increasing at a moderate rate at our last assessment in June, has begun to advance more rapidly
However, although the growth in the US in the past few months has been surprisingly positive, economic performance has been disappointing in Europe
Against expectations, the low energy prices have had only a limited stimulatory effect on household consumer spending
In order to counter any insecurity in the financial markets the National Bank carried out its assessment today, ahead of the planned date of 20 September 2001
However, at present there is considerable uncertainty with regard to assessment of the inflation outlook
Once again, growth in mortgage lending has slowed and currently stands at 3.8
More information on the calculation of the exemption threshold can be found in the attached instruction sheet
The latest developments in the international financial markets  mortgage crisis in the US, correction on stock markets, liquidity shortage on the money markets  have made it difficult to assess the international environment
Expenditure on equipment investment was cut significantly
The SNB still expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters
The National Bank still anticipates economic growth to be close to 2 in 2004
If the Swiss franc were to appreciate rapidly, the SNB would respond appropriately
There is a risk that tensions in the euro area will increase again
Annual inflation measured by the national consumer price index CPI increased from 0.4 in January to 1.1 in April
The new forecast is therefore slightly below that of December from 2011 onwards
Recent indicators show that this is again having a detrimental impact on economic activity
The new forecast puts average annual inflation at 2.6 for 2023, and 2.0 for 2024 and 2025 cf
However, inflation prospects have deteriorated slightly due to the good state of the economy, the continued high price of oil and the low level of the Swiss franc
This growth can be expected to persist, thanks to the healthy state of the Swiss economy
Production capacity will therefore remain underutilised for longer than previously assumed, and the recovery on the labour market is also likely to be delayed
Nonetheless, on the whole, capacity utilisation remains unsatisfactory
On the one hand, structural changes in the economy still have a dampening effect on prices
Reacting to the strong franc and the lacklustre economy, the National Bank has made significant interest rate cuts, thereby considerably relaxing the monetary conditions For the time being it will maintain its expansionary monetary course so as to Swiss National Bank
This scenario for the global economy is subject to high uncertainty, with risks on the upside and downside alike
At the same time, geopolitical tensions and rising commodity and food prices lead to upside risks to inflation across the globe
Negative interest and interventions are necessary to reduce the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments and thus counteract the upward pressure on the currency
As a result of the deterioration in the global economic outlook and the downward revision of GDP for earlier quarters, the SNB is now expecting growth of around 1 for Switzerland in 2012, as opposed to the 1.5 projected in the June forecast
In the EU, however, the growth rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 was lower than anticipated
Owing to weak GDP momentum in late 2016early 2017, the current year is likely to see growth of just under 1.0
The new inflation forecast dashed red curve on the chart covers the period from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011
Despite more favourable exchange rate conditions, Swiss exports again fell in the second quarter
The negative interest charge is to be limited to what is necessary, however
Consequently, inflation will exceed the 2 mark from the end of the forecasting period
The target range for the three-month Libor will remain unchanged at 0.000.25
The National Bank has pointed out on several occasions that we ought not be deceived by the relative stability of the Swiss franceuro exchange rate
Economic developments over the coming quarters will hinge on which additional containment measures are taken in the countries affected
This reflects the efforts of the SNB to provide the interbank market with sufficient liquidity as a response to the increased demand for liquidity which, for its part, was due to a climate in which financial sector agents had lost trust in one another
It intends to hold the rate in the middle of the target range for the time being
Tensions can reappear at any moment on global financial markets
It therefore adheres to its expansionary monetary policy
Among other things, this decrease reflects the appreciation of the Swiss franc over the last three months
The SNB will continue to monitor the development of inflation closely, and will adjust its monetary policy again if necessary to ensure inflation remains within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term
Under the current circumstances, there is the risk that inflationary patterns become entrenched because once the expectation of rising prices has taken hold, it is difficult to correct it
It will continue to provide the economy with a generous supply of liquidity and, if necessary, to purchase Swiss franc bonds with a view to reducing risk premia on long-term debt instruments issued by private sector borrowers
The impact of changes in money stocks on prices is subject to a considerable lag, due to the fact that these changes initially affect activities in the real economy
The uncertainties relate to the global economy and to the level of recovery within the financial industry
Therefore, even though capacity utilisation rates have fallen slightly and staff shortages have become less acute, it is still true to say that capacity utilisation remains at levels above the historical norm
What the economy needs to recover, however, is for exports to pick up
In line with the December forecast, Switzerlands economy will grow at a more moderate pace in 2008
Overall, substantial risks remain, with the focus on issues relating to the economic outlook for Greece and the Ukraine conflict
While, on the one hand, structural changes in the economy are having more of a dampening effect on prices, the high level of capacity utilisation and exchange rate movements, on the other, are exacerbating the risk of higher production costs being increasingly passed on to prices
Unemployment has increased around the world, although short-time work schemes in various countries have so far prevented a stronger rise
Discussions with company representatives conducted by the SNBs delegates for regional economic relations also suggest a moderate improvement of the economic situation
This would have grave consequences for the international financial system
The Swiss National Bank is leaving the SNB policy rate unchanged at 1.75
Added to this, a renewed deterioration in the pandemic situation cannot be ruled out
It is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75, and remains willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration
The domestic sector is still performing favourably
Interest on sight deposits at the SNB remains at 0.75 and the target range for the three-month Libor is unchanged at between 1.25 and 0.25
The SNB continues to expect GDP growth of around 2 for 2018 and a further gradual decrease in unemployment
The Swiss financial system has sufficient liquidity
Mortgage growth was also slightly lower in the first half of 2013 than in the previous year
Unless otherwise specified, a change in the negative interest rate will apply with immediate effect, and the affected sight deposit account balances will be subject to the new interest rate on the day of the announcement
The SNBs new conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the SNB policy rate is 0.25 over the entire forecast horizon
Due to the substantial risks associated with the future path of the international economy, financial markets and energy prices, this forecast involves considerable uncertainties
In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB anticipates that further waves of infection will be successfully prevented
Next year, growth is likely to decline slightly, but should nevertheless remain above potential
This correction is the result, in particular, of the less favourable economic outlook for Europe compared with the last assessment
This does not jeopardise price stability
It is likely that final demand will still be curbed, in particular, by the high levels of unemployment and the bleak outlook for public finances
In the residential investment property segment, the strong price growth continued
15 March 2007 4 With todays decision to increase the three-month Libor by 25 basis points, the SNB has maintained its monetary policy course of gradual normalisation
In the advanced economies, growth was slightly more positive than in the first quarter; this was mainly attributable to the economic recovery in the US
With rising exports, equipment investment in Switzerland is also likely to go up again
Consequently, in the foreseeable future, there is no risk of inflation in Switzerland
For 2019 the forecast stands at 0.4, for 2020 at 0.1 and for 2021 at 0.5
The Swiss National Bank SNB leaves the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
Russias invasion of Ukraine has led to a strong increase in uncertainty worldwide
Given the favourable inflation outlook in the medium term, the National Bank can afford to do so
With its decision to leave the three-month Libor unchanged, the National Bank is adhering to its current monetary policy course and is making use of its monetary policy leeway to support the recovery of the economy without jeopardising long-term price stability
However, production capacity will remain underutilised for some time yet
Exports will be another factor boosting economic growth
Switzerlands economy has continued to recover
Inflationary pressure is likely to remain moderate
Although the situation on the global financial markets has eased somewhat, the minimum exchange rate, with the three-month Libor close to zero, remains essential
For example, inflation could rise further and thus weigh even more heavily on real incomes and consumer demand
The National Bank anticipates economic growth to be 1.5 - 2 for 2004
For 2020, the SNB now expects an inflation rate of 0.2, compared to 0.7 last quarter
Both short-time work and unemployment have declined further
This scenario for the global economy is subject to significant risks
The broad-based, healthy economic situation had a positive impact on the labour market
The positive baseline scenario for the global economy continues to be subject to risks
In the US, economic activity was driven mainly by strong consumer demand, and labour market developments continued to be favourable
There are, however, downside risks for price stability should the Swiss franc not weaken further
Debiting the negative interest triggers a sight deposit account transfer by the SNB for Swiss Interbank Clearing SIC system participants
The forecast now stands at 0.2 for 2021, 0.4 for 2022 and 0.5 for 2023
Given the current inflation outlook, it can be assumed that price stability is guaranteed for the next two years
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro
The Swiss franc has strengthened since the beginning of the year
Risk premia on the capital market have dropped
The inflation prospects have changed since the monetary policy assessment in December 2006
The Swiss National Bank is increasing the target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 0.501.50
The National Bank will therefore keep a close watch on the developments in the financial markets, the global economy, the price of oil and the Swiss franc so as to assess their impact on the inflation
The Swiss franc nevertheless remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile
The revised GDP figures for recent years reveal stronger growth momentum than was originally reported
It puts average annual inflation at 1.2 for 2024, 0.6 for 2025 and 0.7 for 2026 cf
For 2012, the forecast shows an inflation rate of 0.5
For 2012, the SNB is expecting inflation of 0.3 and for 2013, of 0.4
That said, value added has been seriously impacted in industries particularly affected by the containment measures
The other major economic areas also recorded favourable economic activity in the third quarter
GDP thus rose only slightly in the fourth quarter of 2020, this following robust growth in the previous quarter
The global economy has improved over the past few months and the downturn in the Swiss economy has proved to be considerably less substantial than had been forecast in the second quarter
The forecast puts average annual inflation at 1.4 for 2024, 1.2 for 2025 and 1.1 for 2026 cf
The improvement is beginning to assist the Swiss export sector, while the domestic sector is performing well
For 2020, the SNB anticipates an inflation rate of 0.7, compared to 0.6 last quarter
The rate of growth in this area has risen since November, reaching 3.8 in January
Despite a difficult climate worldwide, economic activity in Switzerland stabilised somewhat during the second half of 2002
By contrast, international trade and global manufacturing remain subdued
Our modifications to the assumptions on the global economy are relatively minor and have no significant impact on the outlook for inflation
Second, monetary policy in the advanced economies remains very expansionary
As economic recovery progresses, the SNB will continue to gradually adjust its monetary policy
Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued and should continue to weaken over time
Finally, there are still important downside risks to growth from the war in Ukraine and the pandemic
Despite the most recent interest rate cut, the new forecast up to mid-2004 is virtually the same as that published at the end of last year
The imponderables with respect to the development of the global economy remain considerable, and a sustained economic upswing in Switzerland is not likely until some time in the second half of 2003
However, Germanys economic upturn stands out considerably from the European average
The new inflation forecast calculated with a constant interest rate of 2.25 is shown in red
This favourable forecast is based, among other things, on the assumption that the global economy continues to grow and that the war in Ukraine does not escalate further
Both mortgage lending and prices for single-family homes and privately owned apartments continued to rise slightly in recent quarters, while prices in the residential investment property segment stagnated
On the assumption that the three-month Libor will remain unchanged at 0.75, annual inflation is expected to stand at 1 in 2006 and reach 2.1 in 2007
Until the beginning of 2006, the inflation trend according to the new forecast will fall short of that projected in June
Coronavirus is posing exceptionally large challenges for Switzerland, both socially and economically
In the US and Asia, growth slowed in the second quarter of 2010
Under the present circumstances, this represents an inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions
For all other sight deposit account holders not mentioned under method 1, the SNB sets a_ fixed threshold
Like the previous forecast dashdotted green curve, it is based on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75
Turning to Switzerland, economic developments in recent months have been in line with SNB expectations
The other industries in the manufacturing sector recorded a more modest expansion, in line with the slowdown in manufacturing worldwide
However, inflation is likely to increase again somewhat in the coming months due to higher electricity prices and rents, as well as the rise in VAT
The National Bank views the prospects for the global economy more cautiously than it did only three months ago
Notwithstanding positive signals emanating from the US, global economic development is still subject to risks
Growth was primarily driven by manufacturing, which benefited from dynamic economic developments abroad and the weaker Swiss franc
As the economy recovers, the price of oil is likely to edge upwards again gradually
Since the last assessment, the Swiss franc has appreciated substantially against the euro and the US dollar
In addition, the consequences of the earthquake catastrophe in Japan are, at this stage, difficult to assess
The risks in the international environment, however, have increased markedly causing growing uncertainty as to the further development in Switzerland
Economic activity has declined sharply in the U.S., where consumption and exports have plummeted
Against this backdrop, the SNB expects GDP growth of 2.5 to 3 for 2021
At the same time, imbalances on these markets have decreased slightly overall due to developments in fundamentals
The monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted worldwide are providing important support in this regard
Accordingly, the monetary aggregates grew at a slower pace following the two interest rate decisions of June and September 2004
Developments in the global economy are mixed
At the same time, high inflation could become entrenched as a result of increased secondround effects, requiring stronger monetary policy responses in other countries
Economic signals for the coming months remain favourable
In addition, the SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor at 0.00.25
With the measures decided today, the SNB is forecasting average annual inflation for the following two years of virtually zero
At the same time, a worsening in the tight supply of raw materials could lead to a further rise in inflation globally
Should unexpected developments push up the Swiss franc sharply, the National Bank will take appropriate action
The situation on the financial markets has eased somewhat recently
Against this backdrop, unemployment has increased slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis
In Switzerland, a perceptible economic upswing is only to be expected in the course of 2004
Overall, global economic growth was solid in the second quarter
Thereafter, forecast inflation rises more rapidly than in the December forecast, due to the interest rate reductions since the last monetary policy assessment
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25, average annual inflation is expected to amount to 0.6 this year, 0.4 next year, and 1.2 in 2005
After this step, the interest target range will again exhibit a spread of 100 basis points
According to the National Banks assessment, the Swiss economy will see only moderate growth rates until mid-2003
The forecast is still associated with considerable uncertainties
Yields on Swiss Confederation bonds have also fallen
There is still considerable uncertainty over how the situation will develop
The inflation forecast shows that the rate of inflation will drop below the 2 mark in 2009
Several indicators were already pointing to a brighter outlook for the economic situation, and second-quarter economic data now confirm the picture of a broad-based recovery
The latest rise in inflation is principally due to higher prices for goods, especially energy and food
However, it is still clearly above the range the SNB equates with price stability
This has resulted in a renewed deterioration in the economic outlook
This reflects the dampening effect of todays interest rate decision
The National Bank uses the inflation forecast to summarise its assessment of the inflation outlook and to communicate the future need for action in monetary policy
The Swiss National Bank leaves the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
It also shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising medium and long-term price stability
The SNBs conditional inflation forecast for 2010 and 2011 has increased slightly since March
In doing so, it is countering inflationary pressure, which has increased again over the medium term
Moreover, given the fact that the price of oil has been surprisingly immune to the global economic slowdown, it expects higher inflation in industrialised countries
The National Bank last adjusted its monetary policy on 26 July 2002, when it lowered the target range by 50 basis points
Economic growth was modest in the advanced economies in the first quarter of 2023
Exports are likely to continue to recover, and this should stimulate corporate investment and have a positive impact on the labour market
For one thing, the tight real estate market in the large urban areas and surroundings is likely to lead to higher housing rents even though the mortgage rates have declined somewhat
To ensure appropriate monetary conditions, the SNB is also willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary
Economic development in Switzerland lost considerable momentum in the first three quarters of 2001
Economic recovery is not yet sustainable
For the two following years, a further increase in exports, a rise in equipment investment, robust private consumption and sustained economic growth are anticipated
This development makes it possible to reduce rates again
Mortgage lending and residential property prices have risen strongly in recent quarters
It is also continuing to supply the banking system with liquidity on generous terms
The exchange rate is important to the National Bank
This has led to a general increase in inflation
Consequently, the positive output gap should gradually close
The rate of growth of mortgage loans attained 3.6 in July
In particular, uncertainty regarding economic developments in China has increased perceptibly
The magnitude of the contraction in demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 was unexpected
Moreover, although the financial industry is well into the process of recovery, another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out
In the fourth quarter of 2014, growth in the US remained above potential
To strengthen the banks in this role, the SNB is raising the exemption threshold as of 1 April 2020, thus reducing the negative interest burden on the banking system
Its aim, however, is to prevent a premature changeover to a more restrictive monetary policy, which would endanger the upswing in Switzerland
Owing to data adjustments, the new forecast is slightly lower overall than the December projection
At present, the financial crisis has not had any impact on the granting of domestic loans
2 Banks as defined by the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks
The latest forecast expects inflation to rise to over 2 in the second half of 2005, given a constant interest rate of 0.25
RP 36, is considered to start on the 20th calendar day three months before the beginning of the respective interest period
The Swiss National Bank is lowering the SNB policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5
It covers the period from the third quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2013 and shows 16 September 2010 3 future inflation developments on the assumption of the three-month Libor remaining constant at 0.25 over the entire forecasting horizon
In line with most forecasting institutions, the SNB is now expecting a sharper downturn in the US economy and  to a lesser extent  in Europe
The conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the threemonth Libor remains at 0.75 over the entire forecast horizon
Swiss GDP growth was moderate in the fourth quarter of last year
This rise will be more significant than expected at the last assessment
The average inflation rate for the year 2003 will presumably amount to 1.3
The fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 saw a stagnation of economic activity in Switzerland, with the high price of oil as well as the depreciation of the dollar in the final quarter of 2004 acting as brakes
The Swiss National Bank is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.251.25
Moreover, a not inconsiderable risk of deflation remains
The target range for the three-month Libor remains at 0.000.25
The SNB still assumes there will be a further  albeit slightly slower  recovery, particularly in the industrialised countries
The inflation forecast puts average annual inflation at 2.2 for 2023 and 2024, and at 1.9 for 2025 cf
For this reason, the SNB has decided to maintain the monetary policy adopted in March
First, the significant decline in oil prices is helping to increase demand
The explanation for both the negative inflation in 2009 and the increase in prices at the beginning of 2010 is to be found in a base effect attributable to changes in energy prices
Compared to December, the inflation forecast has even fallen further
This pattern was confirmed after the interest rate hike of December 2005
The measures announced at the weekend by the federal government, FINMA and the SNB have put a halt to the crisis
In March, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast was adjusted downwards once again
It is continuing its generous and flexible provision of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market
Since December, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast has remained almost unchanged at an average of 0.7 for 2010 and 0.9 for 2011
Despite the sluggish development in the first quarter of 2005, the SNB still expects the economy to recover during the course of the year, with an increase in momentum in the second half
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.75, average annual inflation is expected to lie between 0.7 and 1.6 in the next three years
The SNB will also use liquidity-absorbing measures
This decline, however, is partly due to special factors, notably the strong influence of clearance sales prices for clothing
However, it has increased its inflation forecast and is now expecting an average rate of 2.7 in 2008
In the US, growth became more broad based
Nevertheless, the SNB still holds the view that the return to full capacity utilisation will be slower and more uncertain overall than is usually the case at the end of a recession
Inflation prospects for the medium term now look more positive than they did at the March assessment
In January 2004 inflation fell to 0.2
For 2011 as a whole, real GDP growth of 1.52.0 can be expected
For sight deposit account holders subject to minimum reserve requirements domestic_ _banks2 The exemption threshold is calculated as a basis component minus a cash holdings_ component
In the current situation, the inflation outlook remains subject to high uncertainty
While growth in real estate prices weakened overall in the second quarter, growth in mortgage lending was virtually unchanged compared to the previous quarter
Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve decided on 15 March to raise its key interest rate by a further 25 basis points
In line with the SNBs expectations, the global economy has strengthened further
After having averaged 0.6 in the fourth quarter of 2003, the core inflation rate calculated by the National Bank also dropped slightly to 0.4 in January
Average annual inflation is likely to amount to 1.4 in 2009 and 2010
Imbalances thus persist on these markets and continue to present risks for financial stability
Equally, geopolitical tensions could increase
Negative interest and the willingness to intervene are important in order to counteract the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments and thus ease pressure on the currency
It remains a pillar of the economy
In December, the SNBs conditional inflation forecast was adjusted downwards slightly
As a result, inflation will be higher in 2011 and, particularly, in 2012, if the current expansionary monetary policy is maintained indefinitely
The interest rate on sight deposits with the SNB remains at 0.75
In the meantime, the risk of a further weakening of economic activity and the associated danger of a deflationary price development in Switzerland have become smaller
The labour market is showing signs of improvement
It will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions
It is thus projected to remain below 1 until mid-2005
Uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains high
Inflation reached 2.9 in May and is likely to remain at an elevated level for the time being
Equally, the energy situation in Europe could deteriorate again in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024
The export industry is bearing the brunt, however
Swiss GDP growth was moderate in the first quarter of 2024
Uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains exceptionally high and the risks for the global financial system have increased substantially
On the one hand, new waves of infection could weigh on economic activity again
To date, the crises of confidence in Turkey and Argentina have not materially impacted the global economic outlook
The European economy will continue to perform favourably
For the following years, upside and downside risks are more symmetrical
Moreover, momentum in the Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets remains strong, and has led to a further increase in risks for financial stability
The increasingly tighter monetary policy in many countries should also help inflation gradually return to more moderate levels
Growth is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters
These positions are used to calculate the threshold for all interest periods which follow a new incorporation, change to legal structure or transformation and are relevant for calculating the exemption threshold cf
Upside risks predominate in connection with the inflation forecast for the current year
Through to late summer, the Swiss economy also recovered markedly and more strongly than originally expected from the first wave of the pandemic
The SNBs new conditional inflation forecast is therefore above that of December, particularly for 2022 cf
As expected, growth in Switzerland picked up somewhat in the first quarter, after having been relatively weak in the previous quarter
Assuming that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75, the SNB expects an average annual inflation rate of 0.6 in 2007, 1.5 in 2008, and 1.8 in 2009
The new conditional inflation forecast for 2021 and 2022 is slightly higher than in March
Considerable risks are attached to this inflation forecast
For this purpose, it is prepared to purchase foreign currency in unlimited quantities
Nevertheless, forecast inflation remains low for the next few years
The new conditional inflation forecast is significantly lower than that of June
The reasons for this development are two-fold
First, surveys point to increased competitive pressure and narrow margins for many Swiss export firms
The new conditional inflation forecast does not differ greatly from the one we presented in March
Even under this assumption, however, GDP growth is likely to be negative for the year as a whole
Consequently, the unemployment rate has risen again slightly in recent months
In Europe, growth was, geographically, broader-based than in previous quarters
Subdued demand from abroad, the loss of purchasing power due to inflation, and more restrictive financing conditions are having a dampening effect
For 2017, however, the forecast is down to 0.1, from 0.2 in the previous quarter
The oil price expectations were adjusted slightly upwards compared with the previous assessment in December
Residential investment property prices also rose, albeit at a somewhat slower pace
Due to the deepening of the global recession, the SNB is now forecasting a contraction in GDP of between 2.5 and 3 for this year
Should the three-month Libor rate remain unchanged at 0.75, inflation would reach 2.6 by the end of the forecasting horizon
At the end of the forecast horizon, inflation stands at 2.1
With todays decision to increase the three-month Libor by 0.25 percentage points, the National Bank is adhering to its previous monetary policy course
In the second quarter 2002, real GDP was slightly below last years level, but did not contract again compared with the previous quarter
The SNB policy rate change applies from tomorrow, 17 June 2022
The financial industry is gradually recovering, but another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out
Inflation has risen again in recent months, and stood at 2.2 in February
The recovery of the global economy continues and the Swiss economy is benefiting from it
The new forecast puts average annual inflation at 3 for 2022, 2.4 for 2023 and 1.7 for 2024 cf
Swiss GDP growth was solid in the first quarter of 2023
The short-term outlook has deteriorated
Growth is likely to remain rather modest in Switzerland in the coming quarters due to the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc and the moderate development of the global economy
Economic growth is expected to continue in the second half of the year
For 2003, the National Bank is anticipating economic growth of just over 1, while zero growth is to be expected in the current year
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.25, average annual inflation is expected to hover between 0.9 and 1.6 in the next three years
The higher commodity prices will lift inflation further in the short term
The sluggish economic environment in Europe, in particular, has had a dampening effect
Cash holdings in the last RP cash holdings component
At the same time, high inflation could become embedded and require stronger monetary policy responses abroad
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing upward pressure on the currency
In manufacturing and in the service sector, it is at a satisfactory level, while in the construction industry it is high
Economic activity was as anticipated, and the inflation outlook was also confirmed at the new assessment
For 2018, the SNB now expects inflation of 0.5, compared to 0.6 in the third quarter
Owing to a slight deterioration in the outlook for the global economy, medium-term inflation is somewhat lower than predicted in September
Against this backdrop, the SNB with its monetary policy is ensuring price stability and supporting the Swiss economy
The new inflation forecast shows that, with a three-month Libor of 2.75, the inflation outlook is almost unchanged from that in June
Since March 2001, the National Bank has eased its monetary policy substantially, lowering the target range for the three-month Libor by a total of 2.75 percentage points
The negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary therefore remain essential
However, the SNB anticipates that, as abroad, there will be only a partial recovery for the time being, and GDP will not return quickly to its pre-crisis level
This positive development is likely to continue in the coming months
Recently, the National Bank has adjusted its monetary policy twice already
In Switzerland, as expected, the fourth quarter of 2013 saw a weakening of growth momentum, largely as a result of a decline in exports, which led to a corresponding decrease in value added in the manufacturing industry
All in all, positive economic signals in recent months have helped ease the situation on the international financial markets, which were dominated by turbulence at the start of the year
Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 1.75, inflation is expected to hover between 0.9 and 1.5 in the next three years
Banks sight deposits held at the SNB will be remunerated at the SNB policy rate up to a certain threshold, and at 1.0 above this threshold
GDP growth again exceeded potential growth and was broad based
Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25, average inflation for 2010 is expected to amount to 0.9, for 2011 to 1.0 and for 2012 to 2.2
Short-time working has reached unprecedented levels, unemployment has risen rapidly, and consumer sentiment has fallen to a record low
The subdued demand from abroad and the loss of purchasing power due to inflation are having a dampening effect
On the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain unchanged at 0.75, the National Bank expects an annual inflation rate of 1.1 in 2005 and 1.3 in 2006
This is based on the assumption that no measures will have to be introduced that would additionally impair economic activity
For 2013, the SNB now anticipates slightly lower inflation of 0.3
Imbalances persist on the mortgage and real estate markets
The rise in long-term interest rates can be expected to stabilise money growth to a certain degree
The SNB has revised downwards its growth expectations for the UK and the euro area
Therefore, despite the easing of the situation, the negative interest rate and the SNBs willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary remain essential
In spite of the fact that money market rates are already very low, the National Bank still has effective instruments at its disposal
Until the fourth quarter of 2008, the curve representing the March forecast is higher than that for December
The situation on the foreign exchange market continues to be fragile
Owing to the low level of inflation, the National Bank has been able to ease monetary policy substantially since March 2001, having since then lowered the target range for the three-month Libor by a total of 2.75 percentage points
Moreover, the outlook for the emerging economies has deteriorated, and events in the Middle East could push up the oil price
The Libor has declined, in line with the SNBs stated intention, which is to bring the Libor down gradually to the lower end of the target range
The global economic recovery is continuing, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than the SNB had assumed at the time of the previous monetary policy assessment
By contrast, economic activity in the emerging economies was sluggish
Nevertheless, as regards both consumption and investment, demand is likely to remain moderate for the time being
Due to the risks mentioned previously, this conditional inflation forecast is associated with a very high level of uncertainty
It is too soon to tell whether this is an effect linked to the lowering of the three-month Libor, as has been observed in the past
The SNB will take firm action to prevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro
Another appreciation would have a serious impact on both prices and the economy in Switzerland
The National Bank has not made any further change to its monetary policy in its assessment of 20 March 2003
The US economy is growing at a slightly slower pace than expected, and the downside risks have increased
Global growth lost momentum somewhat in the third quarter
The gradual improvement of the global economy is likely to further strengthen foreign demand for Swiss goods and services
In addition, uncertainty about future developments in the fiscal policies of numerous advanced economies is dampening consumer and investment confidence and poses risks to growth
The SNB stands ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures as required
As the other loans remained steady, aggregate lending grew more slowly than mortgage loans
This will increase the capital requirements for these exposures as of 30 September 2022, and will maintain  and where necessary, strengthen  the banking sectors resilience
The economic recovery, while certainly underway, nevertheless remains fragile
Against this background, the Swiss National Bank SNB is making another interest rate cut and acting to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro
To this end, it will increase liquidity substantially by engaging in additional repo operations, buying Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers and purchasing foreign currency on the foreign exchange markets
The global economy exhibited strong, broad-based growth in the third quarter
The trade-weighted exchange rate of the Swiss franc is practically unchanged compared with September 2019
GDP contracted again in the second quarter
Up to the first quarter of 2017, the path of inflation remains almost the same
By raising the target range, the National Bank is further adjusting its monetary policy stance to developments in the economy
The situation on the labour market has also continued to improve
According to a provisional assessment by SECO, real gross domestic product GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006 grew at an annualised rate of 1.8 compared with the previous period
At the present time, this expansive monetary policy does not pose any risk to price stability in Switzerland
During the last few months, the inflation rate has risen considerably as a result of the increase in energy prices
In July, it contracted to 0.3 and amounted to 0.5 in August
The global economy exhibited strong, broad-based growth in the second quarter
As regards the global economy, the risks remain to the downside, owing to numerous structural problems
Overall, the revised quarterly estimates for GDP suggest a somewhat stronger recovery of the Swiss economy since the middle of last year
As is the case with the global economy, the risks for this scenario remain to the downside
For this reason, the SNBs inflation forecast is embedded in a global economic scenario
The Swiss National Bank SNB is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy
In the current situation, inflation and growth forecasts are subject to unusually high uncertainty
The outlook with respect to inflation remains essentially unchanged
Real estate prices, by contrast, climbed at a marginally faster rate
As in the December forecast, the decline in inflation in 2005 is largely due to a base effect
Annual inflation dropped to 1.1 in August from the 1.4 recorded in July
While the growth dynamic in emerging economies is vigorous, the recovery in the industrialised economies remains modest overall
Developments on the labour market also remained positive
Consequently, the path of the new forecast initially lies above that of the December forecast
The economic recovery should therefore regain momentum in the course of next year
The situation on the mortgage and real estate markets still requires the full attention of the SNB
GDP is likely to expand by around 1 in 2019, and the SNB expects growth of between 1.5 and 2 in 2020
The franc is virtually unchanged against the euro
This would be the strongest decline since the crisis in the mid-1970s
The recession continued in the euro area
Foreign exchange markets are very volatile
Equally, a renewed increase in geopolitical tensions could result in weaker development of global economic activity
The situation on the financial markets is still uncertain, but less turbulent than it was a few months ago
Together with the sharp fall in oil prices, the appreciation of the Swiss franc since the minimum exchange rate was discontinued moves inflation further into negative territory for a short period
Recently, however, economic momentum has slowed somewhat
Generally, in times of slow economic activity, a decline is recorded in loans not secured by mortgages
In this environment, unemployment is likely to continue to rise gradually, and the utilisation of production capacity is likely to decline somewhat further
Profit margins are still under pressure at many companies, and the willingness to invest and the demand for labour remain commensurately subdued
This is due to the prices of imported goods and services, in particular oil
The Swiss National Bank will enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro set on 6 September with the utmost determination
The Swiss National Bank is lowering the SNB policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25
It is keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at 0.75
Global economic performance at the beginning of the year was slightly weaker than had been anticipated at the quarterly assessment in December
The SNB will continue to monitor developments on the mortgage and real estate markets closely
This will also have an impact on the economic development in our country
The SNBs conditional inflation forecast of September points to significantly lower inflationary pressure in the medium term
The change applies from tomorrow, 22 March 2024
For 2016, an inflation rate of 0.5 is expected, and for 2017, the forecast is now at 0.3 instead of 0.4
At 1.8 in February, the price increase for domestic goods is distinctly higher than the CPI increase
A weakening in global economic momentum cannot be excluded
With the decline in the quality of certain borrowers during a recession and the contraction in economic activity, it is inevitable that a cyclical tightening of lending conditions, or even a fall in the amount outstanding, will occur
The further deterioration in the inflation outlook stems partly from the unfavourable prospects for the global economy and a more pronounced underutilisation of production capacity in Switzerland, and partly from the fact that a depreciation of the Swiss franc has failed to materialise as expected
The SNB is now expecting the inflation rate to be 0.2 percentage points lower for both 2014 and 2015, at 0 and 0.4 respectively
The expansionary monetary policy continues to be necessary given the latest international developments and the inflation outlook in Switzerland
A correction to the expansionary monetary policy pursued by the SNB for a long time now will be necessary if the economic outlook improves
The SNB will therefore continue to keep a close watch on these factors, so as to be able to react quickly should the need arise
In addition, following a period of stabilisation, prices in the owner-occupied residential property segment rose again slightly
The Swiss National Bank SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between 1.25 and 0.25
It will continue to provide the Swiss franc money market with a generous and flexible supply of liquidity
The latest inflation forecast is based on the assumption that inflation will remain below the 2 level in the next three years
Assuming a constant rate of 0.5 for the three-month Libor, the SNB is now forecasting average annual inflation of 0.9 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010
For the second half of the year, and in particular for 2011, however, the SNB now expects a marked slowdown in growth
September 2012 2 Downside risks to the Swiss economy will also stay high in the near term
This is primarily due to the rise in oil prices and the weaker Swiss franc
Consequently, the inflation forecasts are based on assumptions with regard to the future path of the global economy
At its monetary policy assessment in June, the SNB was still expecting growth of roughly 1.5
As compared to our June assessment, the outlook for inflation has remained largely unchanged, with the exception of the end of the three-year forecast period
Developments abroad represent the main risk
The healthy economy will stimulate the labour market again this year and result in a further drop in the unemployment rate
This will ensure that the secured short-term Swiss franc money market rates are close to the SNB policy rate
At the same time, inflation in many countries is markedly above central banks targets
Nevertheless from mid-2015 onwards, inflation will be lower than forecast in the previous quarter
