The decision of maintaining monetary stimulus is made considering that the recent evolution of inflation is basically the result of the transitory impact of supply shocks and seasonal factors
Furthermore, indicators of global economic activity show lower growth rates and that uncertainty persists in international financial markets
If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve mo netary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures
With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.02 percent in June, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.3 percent, from 2.6 percent in May
This amount was higher than in March, due to operations associated to the regularization of income tax payments

BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to cut the reference rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments  Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range close to 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase in domestic demand
During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following  active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system Direct repo and rediscount operations 5.50 percent
Thus, year-on- year core inflation was 1.7 percent in January at the center of the target

BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.75 The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent This measure is mainly preventive given the strong dynamism of domestic demand and implies maintaining monetary stimulus in a context in which no inflationary pressures are observed
The 12-month inflation would converge toward the lower section of the target range 1.5 to 2.5 percent in most of months of this year
The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows Rediscount operations 1-month LIBOR plus one percent
rate  BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PER _Press Release_  MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR APRIL 2003 In March, the rate of inflation was 1,1 percent 3,4 percent in annual terms, mainly due to specific factors such as the increase in fuels and transportation fares

Direct repos and rediscount operations i 3.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months
March inflation 0,5 percent or 3,6 percent in annual terms is due to temporary events affecting food products, which are expected to cease in April
In June, the nuevo sol nominally depreciated on average 0.08 percent against  the dollar, closing at  3.168 per dollar
However, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items grew 1.4 percent over last 12 months
Moreover, given current macroeconomic data, the Board considers that this adjustment in the reference interest rate does not imply the beginning of a sequence of interest rate rises
As a result of this, inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.53 percent in August to 3.74 percent in September
Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, amid a context of low inflation, and iv
Most indicators of business expectations improved in July and continue to be on the optimistic side

These include the lower prices of public utilities and some food products
The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of July 9,
The outlook for global economic activity has moderated in a context of lower inflationary pressures

One-year ahead expected inflation as of January decresed from 2.23 to to 2.05 percent
In Peru, transitory effects caused by restrictions in the supply of certain food items persist, although some of them have begun to recede since June

These figures reflect the normal flow of credit, which contributes to economic growth
The leading and expectations indicators for economic activity in October deteriorated relative to the previous month and most of them remain in pessimistic territory
In inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester
One of the factors explaining this evolution was the prices of food products, especially the lower prices of onion, poultry, potato and sugar
This cost is lower than that effective since August 3 9,0 percent
The rate of inflation excluding food and energy was 0.24 percent, as a result of which the rate of inflation in the last 12 months fell from 2.77 percent in June to 2.73 percent in July

These measures have allowed to release immediately funds in domestic currency amounting to a total of  2 billion
That is, it is expected the continuity of the shocks reversion in the 2005, so the inflation will converge toward the target level 2.5 percent
The nature of this measure is mainly preventive given that the clear indicators about the growth of production, in a context without inflationary pressures, allow reducing monetary stimulus
The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast 2,5 percent with a 1-percentage point margin
As pointed out in our Inflation Report of September, last 12-month inflation is expected to be transitorily above the upper band of the target range 3.0 percent in the short-term, due mainly to a higher imported inflation rate, particularly in terms of inputs used for the production of food products
The global economy is also showing signs of recovery, even though uncertainty associated with the fiscal weakening of some European countries persists in international financial markets
This measure is aimed at preventing that inflation expectations will be influenced by these supply factors in a context of dynamism of the domestic demand
Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target
The above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them
The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to expand the monetary stimulus when appropriate
Global economic activity has been improving, but at a more moderate pace due to social confinement measures in the face of the new pandemic outbreak

RATE BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments  Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.45 percent in May to 3.25 percent in June being temporarily above the target range due to supply-side pressures
This evolution reflects the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic demand growing at a rate of nearly 8 percent

Business expectations indicators on GDP growth have deteriorated significantly
The yield on these bonds was 6.83 percent at the close of the month

To that extent, the increment of 1,5 percent in the range referred lines above it is justified
The Board has taken this decision considering a gradual return of inflation to the inflation target range in the forecast horizon, taking into account the following factors i Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors, such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities, as well as by the depreciation of the sol against the dollar
The outlook for global economic activity has moderated; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies and international conflicts
