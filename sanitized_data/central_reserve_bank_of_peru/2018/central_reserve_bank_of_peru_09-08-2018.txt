RATE
BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent.
This decision takes into account the following factors: In July, the YoY rate of inflation and indicators of trend inflation showed levels within the inflation target range; ii.
The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.33 percent in July; iii.
Indicators of economic activity show signs of increased dynamism, although GDP remains below its potential level of growth, and iv.
Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent trade tensions, could affect global economic activity.
The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in August and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year.
The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth.
Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rose from 1.43 percent in June to 1.62 percent in July Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.27 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 2.23 percent in June to 2.33 in July, within the target range.
Most indicators of business expectations improved in July and continue to be on the optimistic side.
Moreover, a recovery is observed in several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and investment.
The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent.
Direct repos and rediscount operations: i) 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii) the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months.
