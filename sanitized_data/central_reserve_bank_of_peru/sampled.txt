For January, the estimated range for commercial banks current account balances held at the Central Bank is  170 million to  190 million, on a daily basis
In line with this, GDP is expected to grow 3.8 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in However, the indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have fallen in the past three months due to the weakness of investment
On the other hand, core inflation showed a similar evolution in August with a rate of 0.13 percent, accumulating a last-12-month change of 1.4 percent
Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 2.8 percent, lower than in February 3.4 percent
It should be noted that this range was revised downwards from  130 -  140 million as a consequence of the uncertainty and turmoil in financial markets associated with external and domestic events
The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its session of May 12,
This evolution of inflation has influenced higher inflationary expectations over the last few months
October Monetary program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of October 7, Lima, September 9, 2004
This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to 2 percent towards the end of 2017 and takes into account that i Expectations of inflation in 12 months have increased slightly, but continue showing a declining path within the target range in the next two years; ii The water deficit generated by adverse climate factors has been affecting inflation in transitory manner; iii Domestic economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters, and iv The global economy shows signals of recovery and lower volatility in international financial markets
RATE BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.50 The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.50 percent
The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.44 percent in September; iii
iv Local economic activity has been recovering
The nuevo sol appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar in July, reaching an average exchange rate of  3.161 per dollar
For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 3,0 percent
Other liquidity injection instruments available to the BCRP are repos using reserve requirements as collateral, currency substitution repos, repos using loans as collateral, and foreign exchange repos
The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range
The Monetary Program for the following 12 months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held on the following dates January 11 February 8 March 8 April 12 May 10 June 7 July 12 August 9 September 13 October 11 November 8 December 13 Moreover, in 2018 BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates March 23 June 15 September 21 December 21
The increase in the benchmark for monetary operations and the decrease in the reference interest rates for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits as well as the commissions for swap operations are justified by the declining trend on inflation expectations of economic agents for the current year
Year-on-year inflation increased from 3.0 percent in January to 3.3 percent in February, and year-on-year core inflation rose from 2.9 percent in January to 3.1 percent in February
Year-on-year inflation is projected to stay around the center of the target range over the forecast horizon
Imported inflation, indicator representing the part of inflation that is mainly determined by international prices, was 2.20 percent in October and was mainly due to the rise in the price of bread, given the increase observed in the international price of wheat
Inflation in March showed an extraordinary high rate 1.3 percent due to rises in the prices of some foodstuffs that were affected by the severe rains associated with El Nio
However, volatility in financial markets persists, primarily driven by uncertainties regarding the rhythm of interest rate reduction in advanced economies
Thus, based on the expected pace of growth of economic activity, inflation expectations in line with the inflation target, and a moderate evolution of imported inflation, inflation is expected to converge to a rate of 2 percent
Core inflation was 3.4 percent, but it should be taken into account that this includes some food products such as milk, beef, and eating out-related prices
The average interest rate of the interbank market was 4.12 percent in March 3.82 percent higher than last months, while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles went from 5.4 percent to 6.1 percent in the same period
The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency not included in auctions between the BCRP and the financial system as described below Direct repo and rediscount operations 2.55 percent
Thus, in February, the real exchange rate diminished 3.5 percent 0.5 percent of real appreciation in the last 12 months
The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist
Recent indicators of economic activity continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential GDP levels
Also, the terms of trade are higher than expected thanks to favorable export prices even though upper oil prices
The BCRP Boards next monetary policy meeting will take place on May 7, Lima, April 9,
Inflation is expected to continue declining in the next months, showing rates close to the lower band of the target range
Last 12-month inflation in the first months of 2007 should transitorily be below the lower band of the inflation target 1.0 percent
Climate risks mainly associated with the El Nio phenomenon have decreased compared to the beginning of the year
higher than at end June
RATE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2004  REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50 In April the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima CPI decreased 0.02 percent
It was also approved to raise the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.00 percent
Supply conditions for perishable food products continued improving in November, which contributed to the reversal of the supply shocks that had been affecting inflation transitorily
Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.38 percent in June to 2.36 percent in July, within the target range as well
In this way, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.89 percent, within the target range announced for inflation
This decision does not necessarily imply successive interest rate cuts
In November, the reference rate for these operations was 4,75 percent
Indicators of non-primary economic activity continue showing signs of dynamism, even though the output level remains below its potential, and iv
These factors have a potential negative effect on global economic growth as a result of the weak evolution of the U.S. economy and the persistence of risks associated with the fiscal and financial situation of some industrialized countries
These rises have a transitory impact on inflation
Between June and July, year-on-year inflation decreased from 2.3 to 2.1 percent, within the target range, while year-on-year core inflation declined from 3.1 percent in June to 3.0 percent in July, at the upper limit of the target range
Monetary policy decisions are based on inflation forecasts in order to foresee inflationary or deflationary pressures
This decision does not necessarily imply additional reductions in the policy rate
Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued declining and fell from 2.48 percent in November to 2.30 percent in December 2017; iii
Direct securitycurrency repo and rediscount operations i 8.00 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and ii the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months
The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level of growth
Moreover, indicators of global economic activity confirm an improvement in the global growth outlook
Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.17 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.07 percent and remains around the 2 percent target
Year-on-year inflation fell from 7.97 percent in April to 7.89 percent in May, while core inflation decreased from 5.66 percent in April to 5.11 percent in May, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range
Direct securitycurrency repo and rediscount operations i 5.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and ii the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months
Activity indicators point to a more gradual closure of the output gap
Inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target range in the next months due to the improvement observed in the conditions of food supply, to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economys level of potential output, and to inflation expectations anchored to the target range
Swap a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.30 percent
Inflation expectations remain anchored within the tolerance range
Inflation in November showed a monthly rate of -0.14 percent, a similar rate to the one registered in September -0.16 percent, which reflected the reversal of the prices of perishable food products
It was approved to raise the lending and deposits interest rates for the Central Bank operations For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.75 percent
Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.04 percent 3.04 percent in the last 12 months
Moreover, in October, the nominal average exchange rate decreased 0.3 percent with respect to September, and the real exchange declined 0.2 percent
Since October, the swap commission is calculated on a daily basis and considering international levels
Should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand grow at a faster pace than productive capacity and productivity, the Bank will make any necessary preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate
Even though domestic supply shocks are being observed, the impact of these shocks on inflation is expected to reverse more strongly as from mid-2012, after which annual inflation would converge towards the target range
This rate is lower to that effective since November 17, 2000 8,5 percent
The average interbank interest rate was 2,5 percent in May, similar to the previous month
Formerly, the said rate was 3,5 percent
Following a significant reduction in global inflation from the second quarter of 2022 to the end of 2023, some economies have experienced a slight persistence in year-onyear rates
The dynamism of the economic activity is consistent with the convergence of inflation toward its target level in 2006 from the current inflation levels
The latter rate was 5,5 percent
As of December 9, the BCRPs liquidity injection operations totaled S 61.5 billion, of which S 50.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos
For January, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks deposits held at BCRP is  240 -  260 million
The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima CPI increased 0.2 percent in January, showing a lower increase than in December 2007 0.45 percent
As a result, the year-to-year rate of inflation rose from 3.25 percent in February to 3.97 percent in March
Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.06 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.48 percent in August to 3.45 percent in September
Core inflation showed a rate of 0.18 percent and thus accumulates a rate of 3.27 percent in the last 12 months
In Peru, the decline has been more marked since June 2023, as some of the transitory effects caused by restrictions in the supply of certain food items have receded
The Central Bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range
In September the nuevo sol appreciated 0.4 percent against the currency basket of our main trading partners, although the domestic currency has depreciated 0.48 percent so far this year
Inflation is projected to remain around the lower band of the target range in the first months of 2018 and to converge thereafter to 2.0 percent
The nuevo sol appreciated 2.9 percent against the dollar in October and 6.2 yearto-date
The Monetary Program for December will be approved on the Boards meeting to be held on December 12,
The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.33 percent in July; iii
3.25 percent for direct repos and monetary regulation credits b
RATE CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00 As of December 2004, the cumulative year inflation was 3.48 percent, thus achieving the annual inflation target for the third consecutive year, as the inflation was located inside the target range 2.5 percent with a rank of tolerance of a percentage point up or downward
Most indicators of expectations for economic activity remained in pessimistic territory in February
Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.14 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.8 percent and remains around the 2 percent target
The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects based on  data for the last month, including the following The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima CPI increased 0.47 percent in  June and accumulated 1.5 percent over the last 12 months, as a result of which inflation is again within the target range
RATE BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50 The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory
One-year-ahead expected inflation remained stable at 3.4 percent, approaching the upper limit of the inflation target range
RATE BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 5.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to keep the reference rate steady at 5.25 percent, following two successive reductions
The rise in the prices of papaya, evaporated milk, and citrus fruits observed during the month were partially offset by a drop in the prices of poultry, onion, and sugar
This evolution was mainly associated with a supply of dollars in the spot exchange market and in the forward market of US 601 million and US 900 million respectively
Swap a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent
Year-on-year core inflation was 2.79 percent in October
Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity, although lower than in previous months
Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent commercial tensions, could affect global economic activity
GDP is expected to grow 3.9 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency not included in auctions between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below Overnight deposits 3.0 percent
The Board of the Bank approved to cut off-auction reference interest rates in 25 basis points
This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since July 6 6,5 percent
In 2008, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for each month according to the following schedule January 10 February 7 March 13 April 10 May 8 June 12 July 10 August 7 September 11 October 9 November 13 December 11
Inflation in May showed a rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the sixth consecutive month
Inflation in September recorded a rate of -0.02 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell from 3.17 percent in August to 2.94 percent in September, within the target range between 1 and 3 percent
rates Central Banks August inflation report forecasted a 2004 inflation within the lower band of the range 1,5 2,5 percent
This decision takes into account the following developments Year-on-year inflation decreased from 8.53 percent in September to 8.28 percent in October, while core inflation increased from 5.51 percent in September to 5.72 percent in October, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range
Year-on-year inflation rose from 1.72 percent in April to 1.78 percent in May, while inflation excluding food and energy prices fell from 1.87 percent to 1.85 percent
The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates 3.00 percent
The decision of maintaining monetary stimulus is made considering that the recent evolution of inflation is basically the result of the transitory impact of supply shocks and seasonal factors
Furthermore, indicators of global economic activity show lower growth rates and that uncertainty persists in international financial markets
If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve mo netary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures
With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.02 percent in June, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.3 percent, from 2.6 percent in May
This amount was higher than in March, due to operations associated to the regularization of income tax payments
The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance
Indicators of economic activity continue showing a strong dynamism
In this context, the Central Bank will continue to evaluate all relevant macroeconomic indicators and stands ready to take any necessary measures to ensure that inflation converges to the target range
Global inflation continued to decline, nearing the targets of most central banks, with some countries already reaching their targets
This measure is part of the series of policies that the Central Bank has been implementing since September 2008 to provide liquidity to the economy and to face the international financial crisis in order to preserve the normal functioning of the credit market
Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate declined from 3.01 percent to 3.00 percent
This decision takes into account the following factors In November, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; ii
Core inflation, which registered 0.40 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.6 percent
The BCRP Boards next monetary policy meeting will take place on April 16, Lima, March 19,
This evolution reflects a balance between a strong dynamism of domestic demand and improved productivity in the economy
Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration 2.75 percent anually
RATE BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to cut the reference rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments  Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range close to 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase in domestic demand
During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following  active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system Direct repo and rediscount operations 5.50 percent
Thus, year-on- year core inflation was 1.7 percent in January at the center of the target
The economy grows at a sustained rhythm, without inflationary pressures
In April, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima was 0,05 percent, with a last 12 month inflation of 2,6 percent
The indicators of business expectations improved in January and continue to be on the optimistic side
However, inflation is expected to continue its downward trend over the course of the year
Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration 2.75 percent
However, global inflation is expected to continue decreasing gradually over the course of the year
Additionally, there are potential risks stemming from international conflicts
One-year-ahead expected inflation remained at 3.6 percent in October and is forecast at 3.3 percent for 2022, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range
The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows Rediscount facilities 1-month LIBOR plus one percent
For November, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks deposits held at BCRP is  200 -  220 million
RATE BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.75 The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent This measure is mainly preventive given the strong dynamism of domestic demand and implies maintaining monetary stimulus in a context in which no inflationary pressures are observed
The 12-month inflation would converge toward the lower section of the target range 1.5 to 2.5 percent in most of months of this year
The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows Rediscount operations 1-month LIBOR plus one percent
rate  BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PER _Press Release_  MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR APRIL 2003 In March, the rate of inflation was 1,1 percent 3,4 percent in annual terms, mainly due to specific factors such as the increase in fuels and transportation fares
During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the  following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system Direct repo and rediscount operations 5.75 percent
rate BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 9,0 to 8,5 percent in domestic currency and from 6,0 to 5,5 percent in foreign currency and set the operating target range at  130 -  140 million For the month of September, the Board maintained the range for its operating target at  130 -  140 million as a daily average
The evolution of export prices would continue being favorable
RATE BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 2.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to maintain the reference at 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments Year-on-year inflation is expected to be around 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a moderate downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase in domestic demand
Direct repos and rediscount operations i 3.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and ii the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months
March inflation 0,5 percent or 3,6 percent in annual terms is due to temporary events affecting food products, which are expected to cease in April
In June, the nuevo sol nominally depreciated on average 0.08 percent against  the dollar, closing at  3.168 per dollar
However, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items grew 1.4 percent over last 12 months
Moreover, given current macroeconomic data, the Board considers that this adjustment in the reference interest rate does not imply the beginning of a sequence of interest rate rises
As a result of this, inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.53 percent in August to 3.74 percent in September
Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, amid a context of low inflation, and iv
Most indicators of business expectations improved in July and continue to be on the optimistic side
The Board also reiterates that the Central Bank will adopt any necessary measures to lead inflation to gradually converge to the target range and affirms its commitment to providing the economy with the required liquidity through monetary instruments
The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored, in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level
These include the lower prices of public utilities and some food products
The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of July 9,
The outlook for global economic activity has moderated in a context of lower inflationary pressures
The Board also reiterates that any required adjustments will be implemented in order to ensure inflations gradual convergence to the target range
In April, the balance was  123 million, within the range  120 -  130 million
The BCRP Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in this stance
One-year ahead expected inflation as of January decresed from 2.23 to to 2.05 percent
In Peru, transitory effects caused by restrictions in the supply of certain food items persist, although some of them have begun to recede since June
The expectations of economic agents regarding inflation were revised upwards between November and December, but remain within the inflation target range
These figures reflect the normal flow of credit, which contributes to economic growth
The leading and expectations indicators for economic activity in October deteriorated relative to the previous month and most of them remain in pessimistic territory
In inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester
One of the factors explaining this evolution was the prices of food products, especially the lower prices of onion, poultry, potato and sugar
This cost is lower than that effective since August 3 9,0 percent
The rate of inflation excluding food and energy was 0.24 percent, as a result of which the rate of inflation in the last 12 months fell from 2.77 percent in June to 2.73 percent in July
The BCRP Boards next monetary policy session will take place on February 13, Lima, January 9,
The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 4,5 percent
Indicators of activity and the surveys on macroeconomic expectations show a recovery of economic activity in the first quarter of this year
Business conditions expectations moderated in May but remain on the optimistic side
These measures have allowed to release immediately funds in domestic currency amounting to a total of  2 billion
That is, it is expected the continuity of the shocks reversion in the 2005, so the inflation will converge toward the target level 2.5 percent
The nature of this measure is mainly preventive given that the clear indicators about the growth of production, in a context without inflationary pressures, allow reducing monetary stimulus
The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast 2,5 percent with a 1-percentage point margin
As pointed out in our Inflation Report of September, last 12-month inflation is expected to be transitorily above the upper band of the target range 3.0 percent in the short-term, due mainly to a higher imported inflation rate, particularly in terms of inputs used for the production of food products
The global economy is also showing signs of recovery, even though uncertainty associated with the fiscal weakening of some European countries persists in international financial markets
This measure is aimed at preventing that inflation expectations will be influenced by these supply factors in a context of dynamism of the domestic demand
Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target
The above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them
The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to expand the monetary stimulus when appropriate
Global economic activity has been improving, but at a more moderate pace due to social confinement measures in the face of the new pandemic outbreak
iii Economic activity has been recovering gradually
The interest rates for Central Banks operations in dollars are Monetary regulation credits 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRPs deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained July Monetary Program will be considered in the Board of Directors meeting of July 1, Lima, June 3, 2004
Moreover, the measurements of inflation trends are also within the inflation target range and inflation is projected to continue declining in the following months; ii Expectations of inflation in 12 months continue to be within the inflation target range; iii The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level, although it is expected to show greater dynamism due to the increase of government and private expenditure, and iv The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty associated with an eventual reversal of central banks monetary stimulus in the advanced economies
Both rates are expected to converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year; ii Expectations of inflation in 12 months have also continued to decrease within the inflation target range; iii The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level
RATE BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments  Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.45 percent in May to 3.25 percent in June being temporarily above the target range due to supply-side pressures
This evolution reflects the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic demand growing at a rate of nearly 8 percent
Inflation in the last 12 months continued declining and fell from 2.59 percent in March to 2.31 percent in April
The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on November 12,
The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency not included in auctions between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below Overnight deposits 1.75 percent
Inflation is expected to show a rate of 3 percent at end-2015 and a rate of 2.8 percent at end- Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels
Inflation is expected to remain within the upper band of the target range in the following months due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target in Current and advanced indicators of activity show a weakening in the level of economic activity reflecting the lower growth recorded by our exports as a result of both the economic slowdown of our main trading partners and lower export prices
Direct securitycurrency repo and rediscount operations i 5.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months that a financial institution carries out since March 11, 2022; and ii the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months
The BCRP Boards next monetary policy session will take place on June 13, Lima, May 9,
The outlook for global economic activity has moderated; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, lower growth rates in China and international conflicts
Formerly, the said rate was 3,0 percent
Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels until the third quarter of 2015, but with a faster pace of growth in the last quarter of the year
One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.0 percent in July to 3.1 in August, being slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range
The benchmark announced for the year 2001 is  130- 145 million
RATE BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.50 The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru BCRP decided to cut the reference rate from 2.75 to 2.50 percent, thereby loosening the monetary policy stance, in light of the following developments Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of July were within the BCRPs target range; ii
Global growth risks from trade tensions have attenuated, although the impact of the coronavirus is still uncertain
This upward trend in the forecast growth of economic activity for 2007 6.8 percent is being confirmed by the first indicators of demand this year, although no signals of inflation are observed yet
GDP is expected to grow between 2.6 and 3.0 percent in The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency not included in auctions between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below Overnight deposits 2.75 percent
Swap a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.5 percent
For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of January 2005 are maintained 2.3 percent
The Board also decided on the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities Overnight deposits 3.00 percent per year
This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and takes into account the following factors i Expectations of inflation in 12 months time remain within the target range and continue showing a declining path; ii The prices of some food products are being affected by climate alterations, their impact being expected to be temporary; iii The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has slowed down in the last quarter of 2016 in a context of lower public expenditure
2 June 1 quotation  74,3 percent not included
Inflation in February showed a rate of 0.30 percent, as a result of which the interannual of inflation fell from 3.07 percent in January to 2.77 percent in February, within the target range
Core inflation showed a rate of 0.26 percent 3.38 percent in the last 12 months, and inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.16 percent 2.35 percent in the last 12 months
In the same meeting the Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on BCRP discount window operations in domestic currency  Overnight deposits 0.25 percent per year
Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.39 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.38 percent in March to 3.52 percent in April, as reflected in the price rise of some food products due to seasonal factors
Business expectations indicators on GDP growth have deteriorated significantly
The yield on these bonds was 6.83 percent at the close of the month
The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place in a context of anchored inflation expectations
