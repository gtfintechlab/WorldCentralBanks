RATE
BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments:
# Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand.
One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.6 percent in October.
Year-on-year inflation decreased from 1.8 percent in September to 1.7 percent in October, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range.
Leading indicators continued to show a significant recovery as of October, although they remain below last years levels, while firms growth expectations continued to recover in October.
# Global economic activity has been improving, but remains below last years levels.
The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows.
As of November 11, the BCRPs liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 61.7 billion, of which S/ 50.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos.
In this context, credit to the private sector grew 14.1 percent year-on-year in September, with interest rates declining steadily since April.
The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist.
The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments.
The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: #
Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.
Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year.
The BCRP Boards next monetary policy session will take place on December 10, Lima, November 12, 2020
