BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.0 percent.
This decision takes into account the recent evolution of inflation and its determinants, which advises to make a pause in the preventive adjustments of the reference initiated in May of this year.
Current and advanced indicators of activity show a slight moderation in the growth of economic activity, in line with the forecasts of our Inflation Report.
Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants.
