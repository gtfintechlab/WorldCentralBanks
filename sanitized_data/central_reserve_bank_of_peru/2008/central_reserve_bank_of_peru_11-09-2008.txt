RATE
Last twelve-month inflation in August was 6.27 percent, influenced mainly by supply factors, particularly the higher prices of food, fuels and electricity, which together increased 9.2 percent, while the prices of the rest of goods and services showed an increase of 2.64 percent.
However, a reduction is being observed in the international prices of food inputs and fuels, originated in the slowing of industrialized economies, and should be reflected in domestic prices.
Together with the slower pace of growth expected in the expansion of domestic demand and in inflation expectations, this trend should allow inflations convergence to the target range.
The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of demand pressures and expectations of inflation, and will continue to adjust the monetary stance to ensure inflations gradual convergence to the target range.
The Board also approved the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent.
Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent.
The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its session of October The BCRP will publish its third Inflation Report this year on October
