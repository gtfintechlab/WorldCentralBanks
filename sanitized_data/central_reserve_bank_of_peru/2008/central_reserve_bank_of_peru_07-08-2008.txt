RATE
Last twelve-month inflation in July was 5.79 percent, influenced mainly by supply factors, particularly the higher prices of food and fuels which together increased 9.2 percent, while the prices of the rest of goods and services showed an increase of 2.2 percent.
A moderation in the pace of growth of food prices, a gradual deceleration in the growth of domestic demand to long-term sustainable levels, and lower inflation expectations are expected, and therefore should allow inflations convergence to the target range.
The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of demand pressures and expectations of inflation.
The Board also reiterates that any required adjustments will be implemented in order to ensure inflations gradual convergence to the target range.
The Board also approved the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.0 percent.
Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.0 percent.
The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its session of September
