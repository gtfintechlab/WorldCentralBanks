Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor.",
        "According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.",
        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters.",
        "The MPC also around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 10, 2022) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent.",
        "- The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "transmissible Omicron variant and the associated restrictions have dampened global an 18 month low of 51.4 in January 2022, with weakness in both services and manufacturing.",
        "World merchandise trade continues to grow.",
        "There are, however, headwinds emanating from persistent container and labour shortages, and elevated freight rates.",
        "In its January 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised global output and trade growth projections for 2022 downward to 4.4 per cent and 6.0 per cent from its earlier forecasts of 4.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.",
        "After reversing the transient correction that had occurred towards end pressures.",
        "With several central banks focused on policy normalisation, including ending asset purchases and earlier than expected hikes in policy rates, financial markets have turned volatile.",
        "Sovereign bond yields firmed up across maturities and equity markets entered correction territory.",
        "Currency markets in emerging market economies (EMEs) have exhibited two-way movements in recent weeks, driven by strong capital outflows from equities with elevated uncertainty on the pace and quantum of US rate hikes.",
        "The latter also led to an increasing and volatile movement in US bond yields.",
        "The first advance estimates (FAE) of national income released by the National product (GDP) growth at 9.2 per cent for 2021-22, surpassing its pre-pandemic (2019-20) level.",
        "All major components of GDP exceeded their 2019-20 levels, barring private consumption.",
        "In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2020-21 to (-) 6.6 per cent from the provisional estimates of (-) 7.3 per cent.",
        "Available high frequency indicators suggest some weakening of demand in January 2022 reflecting the drag on contact-intensive services from the fast spread of urban demand indicators, consumer durables and passenger vehicle sales contracted in November-December on account of supply constraints while domestic air traffic weakened in January under the impact of Omicron.",
        "Investment activity production of capital goods declined on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in November.",
        "Merchandise exports remained buoyant for the eleventh successive month in January 2022; non-oil non-gold imports also continued to expand on the back of domestic demand.",
        "The manufacturing PMI stayed in expansion zone in January at 54.0, though it moderated from 55.5 in the preceding month.",
        "Among services sector indicators, railway freight traffic, e-way bills, and toll collections posted y-o-y growth in December-January; petroleum consumption registered muted growth and port traffic declined.",
        "While finished steel consumption contracted y-o-y in January, cement production grew in double digits in December.",
        "PMI services continued to exhibit expansion at 51.5 in January 2022, though the pace weakened from 55.5 in December.",
        "Headline CPI inflation edged up to 5.6 per cent y-o-y in December from 4.9 per cent in November due to large adverse base effects.",
        "The food group registered a significant decline in prices in December, primarily on account of vegetables, meat and fish, edible oils and fruits, but sharp adverse base effects from vegetables prices resulted in a rise in y-o-y inflation.",
        "Fuel inflation eased in December but remained in double digits.",
        "Core inflation or CPI inflation excluding food and fuel stayed elevated, though there was some moderation from 6.2 per cent in November to 6.0 per cent in December, driven by transportation and communication, health, housing and recreation and amusement.",
        "Overall system liquidity continued to be in large surplus, although average absorption (through both the fixed and variable rate reverse repos) under the LAF January 2022.",
        "Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.4 per cent and 13.",
        "Since the December 2021 MPC meeting, CPI inflation has moved along the expected trajectory.",
        "Going forward, vegetables prices are expected to ease further on fresh winter crop arrivals.",
        "The softening in pulses and edible oil prices is likely to continue in response to strong supply-side interventions by the Government and increase in domestic production.",
        "Prospects of a good _Rabi harvest add to the_ optimism on the food price front.",
        "Adverse base effect, however, is likely to prevent a substantial easing of food inflation in January.",
        "The outlook for crude oil prices is rendered uncertain by geopolitical developments even as supply conditions are expected to turn more favourable during 2022.",
        "While cost-push pressures on core inflation may continue in the near term, the Reserve Bank surveys point to some softening in the pace of increase in selling prices by the manufacturing and services firms going forward, reflecting subdued pass-through.",
        "On balance, the inflation projection for 2021-22 is retained at 5.3 per cent, with Q4 at 5.7 per cent.",
        "On the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022, CPI inflation for 2022-23 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1:2022-23 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 5.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.0 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.2 per cent, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).",
        "Recovery in domestic economic activity is yet to be broad-based, as private consumption and contact-intensive services remain below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Going forward, the outlook for the _Rabi crop bodes well for agriculture and rural_ demand.",
        "The impact of the ongoing third wave of the pandemic on the recovery is likely to be limited relative to the earlier waves, improving the outlook for contactintensive services and urban demand.",
        "The announcements in the Union Budget 2022-23 on boosting public infrastructure through enhanced capital expenditure are expected to augment growth and crowd in private investment through large multiplier effects.",
        "The pick-up in non-food bank credit, supportive monetary and liquidity conditions, sustained buoyancy in merchandise exports, improving capacity utilisation and stable business outlook augur well for aggregate demand.",
        "Global financial market volatility, elevated international commodity prices, especially crude oil, and continuing global supply-side disruptions pose downside risks to the outlook.",
        "Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 7.8 per cent with Q1:2022-23 at 17.2 per cent; Q2 at 7.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.3 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2).",
        "The MPC notes that inflation is likely to moderate in H1:2022-23 and move closer to the target rate thereafter, providing room to remain accommodative.",
        "Timely and apposite supply side measures from the Government have substantially helped contain inflationary pressures.",
        "The potential pick up of input costs is a contingent risk, especially if international crude oil prices remain elevated.",
        "The pace of the domestic recovery is catching up with pre-pandemic trends, but private consumption is still lagging.",
        "COVID-19 continues to impart some uncertainty to the future outlook.",
        "Measures announced in the Union Budget 2022-23 should boost aggregate demand.",
        "The global macroeconomic environment is, however, characterised by deceleration in global demand in 2022, with increasing headwinds from financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalisation in the systemic advanced economies (AEs) and inflationary pressures from persisting supply chain disruptions.",
        "Accordingly, the MPC judges that the ongoing domestic recovery is still incomplete and needs continued policy support.",
        "It is in this context that the MPC has decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and 4.0 per cent.",
        "All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution.",
        "The First Advance Estimates (FAE) released by NSO place the GDP growth in 2021-22 at 9.2 per cent over the previous year, lower than the projected 9.5 per cent in the December MPC statement.",
        "However, the First Revised Estimates (FRE) for 2020-21 released subsequent to the FAE point to slightly higher level of GDP than the Provisional Estimates used for calculating the FAE for 2021-22 implying lower projected growth rate for 2021-22.",
        "Overall, GDP in 2021-22 is likely to exceed the level achieved in 2019-20 by less than 2 per cent highlighting the need for accelerating the pace of economic recovery.",
        "The FAE for 2021-22 show that the private consumption expenditure, the largest component of GDP, is yet to reach the pre-pandemic 2019-20 level.",
        "Two other components - government final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation in 2021-22 are projected to exceed the 2019-20 levels.",
        "Exports and imports of goods and services are projected to rise in 2021-22 above their 2019-20 levels.",
        "Even as the pace of growth appeared to be on track at the end of November, with the Covid situation again turning uncertain, policy measures have become crucial to sustain the growth momentum.",
        "The dominant impact of the latest state of the pandemic, directly or indirectly, has emerged from the global scenario.",
        "The direct impact is the significant caseload across countries and the restrictions on economic activities to contain the disease spread.",
        "The indirect impact follows as the spill overs of the initial impact through the supply chains, inflation and monetary policy tightening to contain inflation are realised.",
        "The YOY rate of growth of the world economy in 2022 is now projected by IMF in its January 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook at 4.4 per cent, compared to 4.9 per cent in October 2021.",
        "Going forward, growth is projected at 3.8 per cent in 2023.",
        "Globally, inflationary pressures from fuel and food are expected to abate during 2022-23.",
        "The January 2022 update by IMF also projects the World trade volume - goods and services - to grow in 2022 at a lower rate than the previous October 2021 projections.",
        "The projections also recognise the downside risks to growth related to the spread of Covid.",
        "The global economic environment is also affected by the continued geopolitical risks that may in turn affect trade, prices and capital flows.",
        "The domestic economy has shown strong recovery from the impact of the second wave of the pandemic in Q1: 2021-22.",
        "The growth recovery, however, has been incomplete so far, particularly with respect to private consumption expenditure.",
        "across the country in January, reflects continued weakness in consumer sentiments compared to the survey in November 2021.",
        "Majority of the respondents report for expectations of one-year-ahead situation.",
        "Although slightly higher proportion of respondents now find improvement in the prevailing general economic conditions compared to a year back, majority find that the situation has worsened.",
        "The one year ahead assessment by the respondents reflects decline in positive ratings, probably due to the impact of rise in the infections from the Omicron variant during December 2021.",
        "Perceptions of the prevailing employment and income conditions also reflect weak sentiments.",
        "The mixed picture on consumer spending is also reflected in the pattern of Index of Industrial Production (IIP).",
        "The IIP for consumer durables is yet to rise above the 2019-20 levels in a significant way.",
        "The IIP for consumer nondurables has just reached 2019-20 level.",
        "Overall, boost to the consumption spending would require sustained improvement in employment and income conditions.",
        "The Gross Fixed Capital Formation is projected to increase by 17.4 per cent in 2021-22 (FAE) over the previous year.",
        "The significant increase is over a decline of 10.4 per cent in the previous year highlighting again the need for sustaining this momentum.",
        "The latest estimates of IIP for Capital Goods for October and November in 2021 are lower than the levels in 2020 for the same months.",
        "The Business Expectations Survey conducted by NCAER in December 2021 Confidence in Q3 2021 over the previous quarter, although pace of improvement slowed and the index based on responses in the last week of the survey was lower than the first three weeks of December drawing attention to the impact of rising Expectations Index for Q4: 2021-22 from Q3: 2021-22 after its steady increase since Q2: 2020-21 even as it indicates expansion.",
        "Capital goods imports, one of the key indicators of investment conditions, has increased consistently above the 2019-20 levels during September-December 2021.",
        "To sustain the positive trends in investment demand, improvement in the overall demand conditions would be crucial.",
        "The proposed increase in capital expenditure in the Union Government Budget for 2022-23 will be one of the positive drivers for investment spending, besides continuation of the buoyant export growth seen in 2021-22.",
        "While the current wave of Covid infections has affected consumer and business sentiments, there are also indicators that suggest underlying positive growth trends.",
        "GST collection has registered double digit growth in December 2021 and January 2022, although at a much slower pace than in October-November 2021.",
        "Non-food bank credit expanded by 9.3 per cent in December 2021, year on year growth in the last 12 months.",
        "The PMI for manufacturing and services, while declining from the levels of previous month, remain in expansion zone for the month of January 2022.",
        "The growth momentum of domestic economy is expected to pick up as the impact of the current wave of the pandemic subsides.",
        "The vaccinations and continued adherence to Covid protocols to prevent any further spread of the virus are essential for achieving sustained growth in employment and household income.",
        "Based on the assumption of a normal monsoon, and the present trends in the key indicators of economic activity, GDP growth for 2022-23 is placed at 7.8 per cent, YOY basis.",
        "The quarterly growth trajectory is projected as Q1:2022-23 at 17.2 per cent; Q2 at 7.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.3 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.5 per cent, YOY basis.",
        "The Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted by RBI in January 2022 provides a median GDP forecast of 7.7 per cent for 2022-23.",
        "Applying the forecast of 7.8 per cent on 2021-22 FAE value for GDP, implies an increase of 9.6 per cent over the Second Revised Estimates for 2019-20 or an average annual growth of 3.2 per cent for the three years ending 2022-23.",
        "This highlights the need for supportive policies for achieving a sustained higher growth momentum.",
        "The CPI headline inflation rate for the first three quarters of 2021-22 has come at 5.6, 5.1 and 5.0 per cent YOY basis.",
        "The non-Food and non-Fuel Core CPI inflation rate for the same periods has been at 6.0, 5.8 and 6.0 per cent.",
        "The CPI core measure, which includes the prices of petrol and diesel as well as the prices of transportation services, captures the cost of retail selling prices of petrol and diesel as well as its cost passed on in the prices of the other products in the consumption basket.",
        "The double-digit growth of prices in the petroleum products, therefore, is one of the key drivers of the Core inflation as well.",
        "Going forward, the trajectories of food and petroleum product prices would impact the prices of the other sectors, besides the other sector-specific factors.",
        "The Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the RBI in the first two weeks of January 22 shows a decline in the median of expected inflation rate on three months ahead and one-year ahead horizons.",
        "Perceptions of current inflation rate also declined.",
        "Although the perceived inflation rates are high compared to the actuals, changes in these perceived rates point to expectations of moderation in inflation rate.",
        "Taking into account the present trends, and the favourable impact of the Rabi crop conditions, the inflation projection for 2021-22 is retained at 5.3 per cent.",
        "The projected inflation rate for Q4 is at 5.7 per cent, the same as in the December 2021 projections.",
        "The median forecast of CPI inflation rate in the Survey of Professional Forecasters for Q4: 2021-22 is 5.8 per cent.",
        "With a normal monsoon and easing of supply conditions with the decline of the Covid infections, the headline CPI inflation for 2022-23 has been projected at 4.5 per cent by the RBI.",
        "The quarterly estimates are Q1 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 5.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.0 per cent; and Q4 at 4.2 per cent.",
        "There are indeed factors that may change this scenario, particularly the impact of geopolitical tensions affecting international commodity prices and trade, and the impact of macroeconomic policies of the advanced economies.",
        "To strengthen the positive growth trends in the economy, the need for favourable monetary and financial conditions has remained a critical condition.",
        "Pickup in momentum of consumption and investment expenditure would require access to financial resources to both consumers and firms.",
        "The inflation rates are projected to moderate and stay below the upper level of the tolerance band of the inflation target at this juncture.",
        "With these factors in view, I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "To arrive at a voting decision I take up issues of global risks facing the economy, factors determining its expected inflation path and growth recovery, as well as the type and the impact of guidance.",
        "Global risks include high oil prices, rising inflation and interest rates in major countries and possible volatility in foreign capital outflows.",
        "Indian headline CPI inflation, however, is expected to soften after Q4.",
        "Oil prices are high currently but are volatile and unlikely to stay at current levels, lowering WPI, which will also ease as adverse base effects fade.",
        "The dominance of food price inflation in second round inflation in India makes CPI inflation affect WPI inflation more than the reverse, although normally it is producer prices that are expected to affect consumer prices[1].",
        "Therefore, high WPI need not raise CPI.",
        "Household inflation expectations have also moderated.",
        "Moreover, the food items dominating headline CPI are more amenable to government action.",
        "The government is taking active measures to lower domestic commodity inflation, apart from longer term supply-side measures such as reducing logistics and other costs of doing business.",
        "Monetary-fiscal coordination on this is excellent.",
        "Spillover to CPI from high inflation in advanced economies (AEs) is unlikely 12.1% of the Indian consumption basket but 37% for US.",
        "Inflation propagation mechanisms such as high wage growth and labour shortages in AEs are not at work constant.",
        "A combination of cost restructuring and better scale economies may account for this.",
        "Container costs have been declining since October.",
        "That M3 and credit growth has remained in single digits since the pandemic struck, despite surplus durable liquidity, indicates that aggregate demand is low.",
        "In an IT regime the liquidity adjustment facility makes money supply endogenous[2], any excess durable liquidity is absorbed in the remunerated reverse repo.",
        "Money growth reflects the current state of demand rather than creating demand.",
        "Although the third wave of the pandemic seems to have passed with less economic cost, consumption continues at below pre-pandemic levels pointing to loss of income and demand.",
        "A future corona variant remains a possibility although we seem to have learnt to handle it better.",
        "The budget has reduced deficits only marginally but improved the composition of government spending, which will lower future inflation.",
        "Expenditure commitments have been reasonably met, but the proposed rise in capex will take some time to stimulate demand further, even though some construction activities create jobs with little delay.",
        "2 Indeed, one reason for shifting to the interest rate as an instrument is that money demand becomes unstable, and money 39.",
        "Export growth is high and is expected to continue despite some softening of world growth, but since imports exceed exports, largely because of commodity imports, net contribution of trade to domestic demand is negative.",
        "Another indicator of low demand is high unemployment.",
        "Many have lost jobs in the pandemic.",
        "Inflation targeting theory tells us that output sacrifice is required to reduce inflation when it is caused by supply shocks and the sacrifice can be very high if supply is elastic as in India.",
        "It would not be wise to create even more unemployment in order to reduce inflation, especially when inflation itself is expected to reduce towards the target.",
        "Despite continuing uncertainty there are signs of credit growth and investment picking up in some sectors.",
        "This needs to be supported in order to sustainably reverse the decade long slowdown in private investment.",
        "It follows it is necessary for the MPC to continue to stimulate demand at present.",
        "But not as much as earlier, because some recovery has taken place compared to last year.",
        "Since one year ahead expected inflation is at 4 per cent and the weighted reverse repo is near 4 per cent, the real policy rate has risen from negative to near zero.",
        "Markets, however, have priced in steeply rising policy rates and spreads have risen.",
        "This seems to be an over-reaction to the expected rise in Fed rates and of government borrowing requirements.",
        "It could also be due to equating Indian inflation incorrectly with US inflation.",
        "The Fed has yet to start normalization although inflation has exceeded their target for some time now.",
        "But Indian policy started rebalancing excess durable liquidity from early 2021 with the re-introduction of the VRRRs and the reversal of the CRR cut while communicating that ample liquidity will be ensured and conditions remain supportive.",
        "Gradual adjustment already undertaken, together with the expected inflation path, implies a sharp rise in Indian policy rates is unlikely to be required.",
        "In uncertain times policy is more data driven but the reaction function should be well understood.",
        "The interest differential with the US is large.",
        "Their real rates remain highly negative.",
        "Since interest sensitive foreign flows are still a small percentage of Indian Moreover, some outflows will give more space to support government borrowing without raising durable liquidity.",
        "In any case room has been created to rebalance any rise or fall in liquidity, as required, with existing instruments in the LAF.",
        "The current account deficit remains manageable and the overall balance of payments in surplus with a rising share of foreign direct investment.",
        "In 2013 and 2018 following Fed tightening had upset Indian growth and other macros.",
        "This time there is space to align policy to the needs of the domestic cycle.",
        "In view of expected trends in inflation and growth and in order to moderate market over-reaction, I vote to continue with the current stance and repo rate.",
        "As the third Covid-19 wave peters out in India, the time has come to think of third wave has shown that the economy is no longer hostage to the pandemic, and in fact, as we meet, geopolitical tensions have become a bigger risk to the global economy than the virus.",
        "Monetary policy acts with lags, and it is important to set policy looking at the today.",
        "The RBI projections presented in the fan charts (Chart 2) show growth running out of steam after an initial burst of decent growth in the first couple of quarters.",
        "In other words, the pre-pandemic situation of an economy growing below potential is expected to re-assert itself.",
        "According to Chart 1, inflation is expected to drop close to the 4% target towards the end of 2022-23.",
        "Going by these projections, it appears to me that while real interest rates need to be remain low, they do need to become mildly positive during 2022-23.",
        "The projections also suggest that though a significant part of the normalization of real interest rates would happen through the expected decline in inflation, there would be a need for a modest rise in nominal interest rates.",
        "The fan charts also reveal a very large range of uncertainty on both inflation and growth.",
        "Robust growth coupled with sticky inflation could necessitate larger rises in nominal rates, while weak growth accompanied by benign inflation could open up the space for a more accommodative monetary policy.",
        "With risks appearing to be balanced on both sides, the policy stance needs to be neutral.",
        "I find it instructive to compare the situation today (February 2022) with that at the last pre-pandemic MPC meeting (February 2020) in terms of projections three quarters ahead (Q3 of 2022-23 and Q3 of 2020-21 respectively).",
        "Compared to then, (i) three-quarter ahead growth expectations are about 2% lower, (ii) three-quarter ahead inflation expectations are about 1% higher, and (iii) the real policy rate (based on three-quarter ahead inflation expectations) is now about 2% lower.",
        "This comparison also suggests a neutral policy stance.",
        "Taking all this into account, I vote in favour of maintaining the policy rate at 4% while voting against the policy stance on two counts.",
        "First, a switch to neutral stance is now long overdue.",
        "Second, the continued harping on combating the ill effect of the pandemic has become counter productive and deflects the focus of the MPC away from the core issue of addressing the recessionary trends that go back at least to 2019.",
        "I have in the past expressed my reservations about the abnormal width of the policy corridor, but with all money market rates having moved close to the upper end of the corridor, the persistence with a low reverse repo rate has now become a somewhat harmless fetishism, and I will therefore not dwell on it.",
        "The contours of shifting macroeconomic conditions, visible since October 2021, have got elevated further since we last met in early December.",
        "Let me dwell into these shifts and their implications.",
        "First, the global interest rate cycle is decidedly changing.",
        "The benchmark 10 year JGB yield is at its highest since 2015, while the 10-year German bunds yields have moved into positive terrain in February crossing early 2019 levels with spreads widening in the euro area periphery.",
        "The US treasury yields have surged above prepandemic levels.",
        "On current indications, the Fed is on path to complete taper and start lift off by March and quantitative tightening a few months later.",
        "Markets have moved to expecting five rate hikes by the Fed, two by ECB and three more by BoE this year in addition to the two already effected over last two months.",
        "CPI inflation for December 2021 in the US came at 7% (highest since June 1982) and the PCE inflation at 5.8% (highest since July 1982).",
        "Headline inflation for the euro area as per flash estimates for January 2022 was ruling at 5.1% (highest since 1997 when index recording began) and in UK at 5.4% in December 2021 (highest since March 1992).",
        "With inflation in these geographies witnessing wide gaps over their 2% inflation targets, their central banks have little choice but to raise rates sooner than later.",
        "The situation in India is not similar.",
        "While CPI inflation at 5.6% in December 2021 is higher than the target, it is still within the tolerance band and is projected to recede in 2022-23 allowing monetary authorities to remain accommodative.",
        "However, the changing global monetary policy cycle implies that emerging market economies like ours will do well to brace for tighter financial conditions ahead even if domestic monetary policy stays accommodative.",
        "Moreover, as interest differential narrows and current account widens, macroeconomic dynamics will come into play.",
        "How should our monetary policy react to this; and will inflation targeting hamper exchange rate management in these conditions?",
        "Low for long interest rates will certainly bring in macroeconomic imbalances and it is expedient that policy rate should be raised as soon as growth is judged to recover on a durable basis or inflation is seen to be turning endemic.",
        "In the interim, the good part is that we have built buffers against possible capital outflows.",
        "There is evidence to suggest that in small open economies that face imperfect substitution between domestic and foreign financial assets, the exchange rate management greatly enhances the efficacy of inflation targeting.",
        "These economies are able to avoid macroeconomic fluctuations which can be driven by self-fulfilling expectations.",
        "Sterilised interventions can be a key strategy should the need arise.",
        "Typically, in case of sudden stops, rise in global interest rates prompts corporate sector to deleverage.",
        "Indian corporates have already deleveraged significantly and also reduced stock of external commercial borrowings in US dollar terms, which at end-September 2021 was 7.3% lower than at end of 2019.",
        "The currency has been the bug bear for emerging markets during upturn cycles in global interest rates.",
        "However, the original sin has somewhat weakened in recent years with the development of local currency bond markets.",
        "With high foreign reserves, exchange rates may turn less sensitive to global factors such as the US VIX.",
        "India having moved to inflation targeting regime should benefit from lower local currency spreads as well as lower exchange rate risk premia.",
        "However, it will be important to maintain credibility by aiming to maintain inflation on a sustained basis at or near the target as soon as real economy conditions normalise.",
        "Second, Omicron variant, along with continued port congestions and supply shortages has started to drag down global growth.",
        "This, in turn, may act in narrower with falling external demand acting to dampen price pressures that have turned elevated from the supply-side.",
        "Omicron wave has pushed the broad-based recovery further down the time, even though the disruptions caused by this third wave have been smaller compared to the first and even the second wave.",
        "Three points are noteworthy: (i) in India, the 7-day Moving Average of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases during this wave has dropped 60% from its peak on January 25 but is still 14 times the number when the first Omicron case was detected in India; (ii) though the mortality incidence in India is currently about a fourth of the peak seen during the second wave, the daily new deaths have risen three times since the onset of the Omicron wave and currently matches the peak deaths seen during the elongated first wave and so, hard statistics do not yet afford the comfort that we can overlook the pandemic and focus beyond; (iii) vaccinations have certainly contributed to mitigating the severity of disease outcomes.",
        "However, with continuous mutations, there is lack of clarity on enduring vaccine efficacy.",
        "Third, uncertainties about energy prices have risen considerably.",
        "Indian crude oil basket is up nearly 25% in the previous two months.",
        "The current geopolitical stress in Europe is a significant risk and if it translates into oil and gas prices spiking, we will need to adjust macro-economic policies suitably.",
        "Fourth, it is a no-brainer that the fiscal impulse needs to be factored in our monetary policy calculations.",
        "The pace of fiscal consolidation this year has been balanced by consideration to preserve Keynesian stimulus and to continue spending support for those disproportionately affected by the pandemic.",
        "The size of the gross remains important to avoid inferior outcomes.",
        "In this backdrop, smooth rebalancing of liquidity assumes critical importance for inflation management.",
        "This, however, does not mean that monetary policy should no longer support growth.",
        "While the capex push in the latest budget will support growth, monetary policy still has a complementary role to play.",
        "Uncertainty remains on account of whether States and PSUs will keep capex high this year and whether execution will remain on track.",
        "Let me now briefly sum up how growth and inflation scenarios might unfold and my view on the decisions at hand.",
        "High frequency indicators, after impressive sequential improvements during June-October 2021 lost momentum in November but bounced back in December.",
        "Early information on select high frequency indictors now available for January 2022 exhibit renewed loss of momentum in January on account of Omicron spread.",
        "Electricity demand met has decelerated to a 2.1% m-o-m increase in January 2022 from 9.9% in December 2021.",
        "Vehicle registrations, E-way bills and toll collection volumes contracted m-o-m by 7.9%, 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively in January 2022.",
        "Overall, automobile sales, crude oil production, railway and air passenger traffic are yet below the 2019-20 levels.",
        "While the unemployment rate fell in January 2022 to 6.6% from 7.9% in December, it was mostly due to a marked sequential fall in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) by 1-percentage point to 39.9%.",
        "Employment rate worsened in January 2022 to 37.2% and was the lowest since August 2021 and LFPR was the lowest in last seven months.",
        "On inflation, the headline inflation is projected to ease to the vicinity of 5.0% mark in H1:2022-23 and then recede further to the target of 4.0% by Q3:2020-23.",
        "However, monsoon outturn and oil price dynamics will need to be closely watched.",
        "While for decision at hand, both the baseline and the risks are important, the incremental data since the December meeting affords some comfort as it suggests that the fears that price increases may get generalised are not materialising.",
        "At the item-level, while 80% of the items registered a sequential increase in October 2021, the number dropped to 73% in November and further to only 66% in the latest reading for the month of December, which is in line with the pre-pandemic average for the inflation targeting period.",
        "Similar trend of a lower diffusion is also seen in the case of WPI, with the index falling in December for the first time in 19-months.",
        "Considering the above, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and retaining the accommodative stance, while emphasising the need to maintain appropriate financial conditions with evolving situation.",
        "The global outlook is sombre.",
        "Consumption spending is dented by the Omicron-driven wave of the pandemic.",
        "Labour and production disruptions continue.",
        "Consensus forecasts suggest that a global deceleration has commenced in the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Multilateral institutions project global growth losing up to 2 percentage points of speed during 2022 and 2023.",
        "In other words, a prolonged slowdown looms and there are risks that it could tip over into a recession.",
        "Already there are indications that supply chain pressures are peaking and getting set to ease.",
        "In corroboration, the UNCTAD nowcasts merchandise trade volume to have picked up pace in the last quarter of 2021 from the quarter before.",
        "This cannot happen without port decongestion and supply chain pressures easing.",
        "In my view, the pandemic inflation surge is not being driven by excess demand but by supply constraints.",
        "It is turning out to be harder to bring supply capacities on stream than for demand to restart, partly due to the fact that supply capacities are in the wrong places.",
        "For instance, the pandemic caused a shift in consumer spending away from services and towards goods.",
        "The result is supply bottlenecks in goods producing sectors and spare capacities in services.",
        "Consequently, inflation is driven ever higher even though economic activity is yet to fully recover to its potential.",
        "Monetary policy is an instrument of stabilisation.",
        "Its role is to align demand with supply, not the other way round.",
        "When inflation is driven by demand, monetary policy can stabilise inflation and growth.",
        "Monetary policy cannot play its stabilization role when inflation is the result of supply constraints.",
        "So central banks have a choice: either accept higher inflation for some time or be prepared to be accountable for destroying demand.",
        "The reality, however, is that in terms of the policy responses, the biggest economies in the world are pulling in opposite directions.",
        "Monetary policy authorities in several parts of the world look at inflation in the rear-view mirror in which objects can look bigger than they are and they prepare to normalise and tighten.",
        "If they looked forward, they would sight a falling trajectory of inflation.",
        "Other countries have to brace up for shock waves from spillovers.",
        "Geo-political tensions and climate transition challenges complicate the outlook.",
        "Overall, I regard monetary policy chasing inflation instead of anticipating it as the main factor weighing down on global growth prospects.",
        "The Indian economy is encountering headwinds as well as cross currents.",
        "First the headwinds: (1) even though we allow ourselves cautious optimism about the recent decline in infections, it is important to keep in mind that India has the second highest caseload of Covid-19 in the world and it is important to be cognisant of the scarring; (2) a mutation of Omicron - Ba2 - is showing up around the world and spreading fast - India has already reported cases of this sub-variant; and (3) more than a billion vaccinations have been achieved but only 56 per cent of the total population is fully vaccinated; the next billion will be back breaking.",
        "Turning to cross currents, mobility of people has exhibited a sequential moderation in January, but movement of goods remains robust as evident in freight volumes, toll collections and GST revenues.",
        "Aggregate demand conditions are facing similar conflicted pulls.",
        "Power and fuel consumption is rising, but there is a broadbased decline in vehicle registrations, primarily due to shortage of semiconductors amidst global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Consumer confidence has improved, sales of fast moving consumer goods has been inching up and in the top 7 cities, housing sales jumped in 2021.",
        "On the hand, labour participation is falling.",
        "All in all, very divergent pulls.",
        "Second, services exports are also doing well.",
        "These developments should work towards keeping the current account deficit within sustainable limits.",
        "Third, foreign direct investment into India has held up well, moderating slightly from last international liabilities.",
        "Thus, the external sector, which will bear the brunt of shocks from abroad, remains robust and resilient enough to withstand the tidal waves of global spillovers.",
        "Fifth, the agriculture outlook is bright, with both foodgrains and horticulture heading towards new records.",
        "The projections indicate that headline CPI inflation (year-on-year) may test the upper tolerance band in January 2022.",
        "There will be public consternation on February 14 when the CPI for January will be released, but what may escape public notice is that this will essentially be because of an unfavourable base effect which may camouflage a welcome decline in the momentum of key food prices that has set in since October 2021.",
        "There has also been some let-up in input cost pressures.",
        "To sum up, economic activity in India appears to have resiliently withstood the third wave, but messages from incoming high frequency indicators are mixed.",
        "It is prudent to assume that the recovery may have lost some momentum during Q4: 2021-22 and Q1: 2022-23.",
        "Inflation appears to be approaching an inflection point after which it is projected on a downward path through all of 2022-23.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for maintaining the policy rate and the accommodative stance of policy unchanged.",
        "This MPC meeting takes place in the backdrop of global headwinds turning more adverse.",
        "Perceptible slowdown in growth together with elevated inflation in several countries characterise the global economy at present.",
        "The trajectories of growth and inflation, however, continue to diverge between countries.",
        "This has impelled some central banks to embark on aggressive policy tightening to quell inflation risks, while a few others, mostly emerging market economies (EMEs), continue to maintain accommodative policies.",
        "The adverse spillovers from such divergent policy responses could materialise quickly on the global and domestic outlook.",
        "Policy making is getting increasingly complex in this environment.",
        "In the domestic front, rapid spread of the Omicron variant in conjunction with the fading of festive and pent-up demand has tempered economic activity in the nearterm as reflected in several high-frequency indicators.",
        "Going forward, the current wave is showing signs of waning and with the return of normalcy, the pace of economic activity is likely to be bolstered by buoyant _Rabi prospects, robust export_ demand, accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions, improving credit offtake, and the continued push in capital expenditure and infrastructure in the Union Budget 2022-23.",
        "On the downside, slowing global growth could impact exports while demand for contact intensive services would remain contingent on the trajectory of COVID-19 infections.",
        "High commodity prices and supply side shortages could weigh on corporate profitability amid weak pricing power and unfavourable base effects during 2022-23.",
        "The global financial market volatility associated with monetary policy normalisation process in the advanced economies could further complicate the situation.",
        "As regards inflation, there has been considerable improvement in the outlook for food prices since the last bi-monthly review.",
        "Vegetable prices, after the spike of October-November, have seen significant seasonal correction which is likely to continue on fresh winter crop arrivals.",
        "In addition, the December CPI print saw price corrections in edible oils and pulses coming from the supply side interventions by the Government.",
        "The record Rabi acreage, propelled by a significantly higher acreage of oilseeds and pulses, along with prospects of higher yields for wheat, augur well for a bumper harvest of key food items.",
        "Further, considering the advance estimates of a robust kharif harvest, and on the assumption of a normal monsoon, there is room for considerable optimism on the food inflation trajectory over the next financial year.",
        "The renewed surge in international crude oil prices, however, requires close monitoring.",
        "We need to remain watchful of the risks to domestic inflation arising from rise in international commodity prices due to exogenous factors including geo-political developments.",
        "While core inflation remains elevated, demand-pull pressures are still muted, given the slack in the economy.",
        "On balance, inflation is likely to peak in Q4: 2021-22 and thereafter soften to around 5.0 per cent in H1:2022-23 and further closer to the target in H2:2022-23 with an average inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for the entire financial year.",
        "Amidst growing divergence in policy responses on the global front, our monetary policy should remain attuned to the evolving domestic inflation and growth dynamics.",
        "Despite recovery in 2021-22, real GDP is only marginally higher than the pre-pandemic level with private consumption still trailing its 2019-20 level.",
        "Inflation pressures in India continue to emanate largely from supply side factors, and the recent print also reflects adverse base effects.",
        "The expected moderation in inflation trajectory over the next financial year provides room for monetary policy to remain accommodative.",
        "At the same time, economic recovery from the pandemic remains incomplete and uneven and continued support from various policies remains crucial for a sustained recovery.",
        "In this period of prolonged uncertainty, it would be wise to remain agile and respond in a gradual, calibrated and well telegraphed manner to the emerging challenges.",
        "Taking into consideration the outlook for inflation and growth, in particular the comfort provided by the improving inflation outlook, the uncertainties related to Omicron and global spillovers, I vote for status quo in the repo rate.",
        "I also vote to continue with our forward guidance of accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",

        "The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.",

        "On the positive side, there were indications of moderating pattern of inflation rate in 2022-23 on the basis of the ongoing recovery, assumption of a normal monsoon and moderation on international commodity price pressures.",
        "The sharp changes in the broader global economic environment that have now unfolded require a reconsideration of the economic outlook and the policy responses.",
        "As the shocks to the price conditions are essentially on the supply side, emanating from external sector, unless the potential of the reviving domestic demand conditions to sustain higher prices is reduced, inflation pressures would rise further.",

        "To add to the shock, the Fed kept tryst with the lift off in mid-March and indicated a quantitative tightening (balance sheet reduction) starting May.",
        "The baseline looks like the Fed will consciously entail a significant growth sacrifice and go ahead with aggressive rate hikes in the rest of the year in a bid to tame high inflation.",

        "Against their 2% inflation targets, CPI inflation in the U.S., euro area and UK inflation are set to cross 8% in near term, which is four times their targets.",
        "Notwithstanding the difficulties in measuring potential output amid extreme shocks, wide array of measures suggests that the output gaps in the U.S. and the U.K. economies have not just closed but turned positive, though due to shallow cyclical recovery and the war retrenchment the same cannot be said of the euro area.",
        "So, the advanced economies face a big inflation gap and a closed output gap, thus justifying aggressive tightening based on the central bank reaction functions.",
        "Even in many emerging markets, inflation is ruling at multi-year highs.",
        "In contrast, inflation in India is not yet in inertial motion.",
        "Nevertheless, considering that we face elevated inflation that is projected, on an average, to be 1.7 percentage point above target and a likely closed output gap in my assessment later this year, it is important to take measured policy actions.",
        "Let me now cover the growth and inflation assessment and the trade offs involved.",
        "The level of GDP in 2021-22 crossed the pre-pandemic 2019-20 level not just in aggregate but in all components of aggregate demand.",
        "In terms of quarterly GDP, it has stayed above corresponding pre-pandemic quarter of 2019 since Q2 of 2021-22 and in Q3 it had exceeded pre-pandemic levels for all components.",
        "On the supply-side, the GVA data shows that in 2021-22 the output of all sectors, except the aggregate since Q2 of 2021-22 and in Q4 is likely to do so for all sectors, including indicators have shown distinct month-on-month improvements since December 2021.",
        "By February 2022, almost all indicators have moved above pre-pandemic levels, except a few, mainly automobile related, where activity has relapsed due to semiconductor shortages.",
        "So, it is safe to assume that output has recovered now, though the improvements from hereon may remain moderate given the expected growth deceleration on account of war.",
        "On inflation, it has breached the upper tolerance level and is expected to remain so in Q1 of 2022-23.",
        "There are upside risks that cannot be ignored.",
        "Global crude oil prices have been highly volatile of late and can move in either direction from here.",
        "The uncertainty on this account has large ramifications for projection of any macroeconomic variable.",
        "If the war ends and global recovery sustains, oil prices can move up again later this year once the effects of release of strategic reserves wane in 6 months.",
        "Gas prices can rise further if Russia cuts supplies to Europe or Europe implements plans to reduce dependence on Russian gas.",
        "However, energy prices can fall from here if war ends soon and no sanctions are levied by EU in this sector.",
        "The current upsurge in energy prices is masking the potential impact of the likes of EV hummers that portend a trend shift downwards in oil prices over the mediumterm.",
        "Also, if oil prices persist at current high levels, it can trigger ramping up of tight oil.",
        "The expected easing of food prices even if monsoon is normal, runs the risk from elevated input costs, especially of fertilisers and diesel that can result in jacking up of floor that is set by minimum support prices (MSPs).",
        "Global food prices have already gone up substantially and supply shortages may persist for more than a year as sowing in war torn Ukraine will be impacted.",
        "More importantly, in my assessment, core inflation is expected to stay above 6% through 2022-23 as the price shock from the war in Ukraine will be transmitted through mineral and metals as soaring coal prices and Palladium group and other metal shortages seep through to retail levels.",
        "They will also bring down growth and the resultant demand destruction may put some lid on surging commodity prices.",
        "The global shock can have large spillovers to India through multiple channels.",
        "First, accentuated supply chain disruptions will result in longer episode of cost-push inflation.",
        "Second, this will erode purchasing power and slow down the economy.",
        "Third, the CAD will rise, especially if negative real rates persist and impact domestic savings.",
        "The median rate on fresh rupee term deposits has a negative carry of about 2% in real terms.",
        "Fourth, while fiscal policies have scope to limit the pass-through of imported inflation, it will need to be balanced off in a manner that twin deficits remain sustainable.",
        "Fifth, the interest rates and exchange rates can have profound effects on growth and inflation through contesting channels, in which the capital flow channel could be the most important.",
        "Even as these risks amplify, India has strong buffers to price the shifts, the dynamics could turn favourable again.",
        "So, what are the policy options in this backdrop?",
        "As the slowdown and inflationary impulses have hit us with monetary policy already being very accommodative, there is not enough room to pump prime growth.",
        "If output levels fall again, the negative output gap may help soften high inflation as the pass-through to retail levels may remain contained.",
        "However, lack of contestability and collusive behaviours have been seen in the past and the price rises can follow to protect margins.",
        "It is important to keep a sense of scarring and fall in potential output as large scarring will also mean an early closing of output gap causing inflationary pressures to accentuate.",
        "Recovering to pre-pandemic trend should not guide monetary policy at this stage and policy should focus on non-inflationary sustainable growth in the economy.",
        "A close watch on inflation expectations is necessary.",
        "If expectations are rising, especially if they turn unhinged and start rising faster than even actual inflation, monetary policy would have to reign in expectations to prevent a self-sustained inflationary spiral.",
        "Headline inflation has stayed elevated for long and has tested our tolerance.",
        "Even though the current high inflation is not primarily a monetary phenomenon it is critical to ensure that economic agents place the use of flexibility in the context of extra-ordinary circumstances that were prevailing and do not perceive an implicit upward drift in inflation target.",
        "Such a slip can affect inflation expectations.",
        "The best way to support growth on a durable basis is to have a strong commitment to low and stable inflation.",
        "I wish to sign off with this note.",
        "Considering the emergence of a different growth-inflation trade-off, it is best to start withdrawing monetary accommodation through liquidity and rate actions that can begin with raising the floor and normalising the corridor.",
        "The policy will still stay accommodative as rates, even after lifting nominal rates, will stay below real neutral rate for foreseeable future.",
        "Monetary policy is not a rocket science, but the timing of the launch of the rocket is nevertheless important as monetary policy transmits to its final goals with long and variable lags.",
        "With a flatter Phillips curve, tackling inflation becomes that much harder as it may call for larger output sacrifice.",
        "So, a deft policymix is needed.",
        "We have varied tools and with right cross fertilisation of these tools it should be possible to bring back inflation closer to the target later without much growth sacrifice and without a very high terminal rate.",
        "It is important to note that the labour markets in India are yet to heat up and this is reflected in muted wage and house price pressures, below trend labour force participation rate and flattish unemployment levels.",
        "Considering the above, I vote for leaving policy rate unchanged and for staying accommodative, while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation as indicated in the resolution.",
        "In a world in which deglobalisation seems imminent, one thing has become globalised and that is the alarm about inflation.",
        "With 60 per cent of developed than half of developing countries experiencing inflation above 7 per cent, the climb in prices is testing societal tolerance levels.",
        "The view that increasingly occupies centre-stage is that irrespective of whether supply bottlenecks are the driver or pent-up demand, it will become more difficult to tame inflation the longer the fight is delayed.",
        "To quote an influential view, it will make central banks unpopular, but they have been there before.",
        "The rationale underlying this point of view is that whether the jump in oil and other commodity prices will be short-lived or not is not known; but if these prices ignite and levitate the prices of other goods and services sympathetically, the fear will gain ground amongst the public that inflation is going to stay high for a while, and this can end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
        "Hence financial markets race ahead of central banks in foretelling what they should do, by how much and by when.",
        "Supply disruptions, soaring commodity prices and ensuing financial market are already materialising.",
        "Instead they darken the outlook for growth.",
        "Macroeconomic conditions are the toughest for developing countries, with acute shortages of even essentials showing up alongside spiralling prices.",
        "On the one hand, the cost of foreign currency debt for EMEs is rising and on the other, they are forced to drain currency reserves in order to shore up exchange rates.",
        "Higher commodity prices could also complicate the situation for governments that have been striving to mitigate the impact of the pandemic by offering food and energy subsidies to households.",
        "The key question is: will it be a goldilocks moment?",
        "Will central banks deliver the perfect disinflation, the so-called soft landing?",
        "Or will they overshoot the runway and precipitate an unwanted recession on a world weary with pandemic woes, war and worn and torn supply chains?",
        "In fact, the view gaining ground is that inflation is at heights that have shattered glass ceilings and the only way to excoriate it is to force a recession - the so called hard landing.",
        "The dilemma is even sharper for price stability?",
        "Geopolitical risks appear overwhelming at this juncture and over the foreseeable near-term.",
        "The RBI has been preparing for tail risks in either direction.",

        "Second, open market sales and forex operations during the year have a menu of maturities have been conducted with a view to get market participants attuned to the alignment of money market rates with normal liquidity management procedures.",
        "The RBI is in the process of completing the migration to a fully fledged liquidity and lower bounds with the policy rate at the centre; access on all days of the week, throughout the year; and restoration of the corridor to its pre-pandemic width and operation.",
        "During the course of 2022-23 and up to April 2023, all pandemic-related extraordinary measures will cease.",
        "These actions empower the RBI at a moment of reckoning.",
        "If, as the projections show, inflation persists in high reaches, the drainage of liquidity already achieved and planned for the year ahead will reduce risks of excess liquidity fanning inflationary pressures and posing threats to financial stability.",
        "It will also facilitate the transmission of policy impulses across market segments and the interest rate structure.",
        "If, on the other hand, risk sentiment improves globally and India receives large volumes of capital flows, the standing deposit facility expands the capability of the RBI to undertake full and seamless sterilisation without running out of instruments.",
        "This will help to keep monetary expansion consistent with the outlook on inflation and growth.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for status quo on the policy rate.",

        "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets at a time when tectonic shifts in geopolitical environment are materially affecting the global and domestic outlook on both inflation and growth.",
        "Just as the global economy seemed to be on the cusp of returning to normalcy from the pandemic, the war in Europe and subsequent sanctions have further clouded the outlook.",
        "The war-induced price spikes in food, oil, gas, fertiliser and several key industrial inputs, together with continued supply chain bottlenecks, are posing major upside risks to inflation which has already scaled multidecadal highs in several countries.",

        "The increase in crude oil price and its direct and indirect effects on CPI contributed to around 60 per cent of the upward revision in projections with the other major contributor being the spillovers coming from the global food price shocks on wheat, edible oil and feed cost pressures impacting on poultry, milk and dairy product prices.",

        "Fuel inflation moved back to double digits in June primarily due to the rise in LPG and kerosene prices.",

        "At 7.3 per cent, it is also higher than any of the previous four quarters of 2021-22.",
        "The moderation seen in the headline inflation rate in May and June, from 7.8 per cent in April to 7.0 per cent was mainly on account of the decline in food inflation and inflation in the category of items excluding food and fuel & light.",
        "But in each of the three major components of the headline, the year-on-year (YOY) inflation rate remained at or above 6 per cent in June, highlighting the continued broad-based inflationary pressures.",
        "Reduction in the excise duty on petrol and diesel by the central government and some of state governments towards the end of May helped ease price pressures of May 2022 helped ease price pressures on food inflation.",
        "The commodity prices in the international markets, including metals and crude oil, softened from the highs that prevailed when the Russia-Ukraine war broke out.",

        "These have been the positive developments as far as inflation scenario is concerned.",
        "However, uncertainty on inflation pressures in the global environment remains significant.",
        "Prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and disruptions in supplies, especially for energy and food commodities are a major source of uncertainty for price trends.",
        "The direct impact of supply disruptions, even if targeted to some geographies, is quickly transmitted elsewhere to meet the overall demand supply imbalances.",
        "Weakening of many currencies against the US dollar also imparts inflationary pressures on the domestic economies of the other countries.",
        "On the domestic front, inflationary pressures exerted by the rising input prices are continuing.",
        "The impact of recent changes to GST rates, somewhat uneven distribution of the southwest monsoon rainfall with deficiency in the eastern region of the country, could be source of upward pressure on prices.",
        "The Enterprise Surveys conducted by the RBI in May-June 2022 find that majority of the firms in all the major sectors of the economy, manufacturing, services and infrastructure, expect the cost pressures to continue through the current financial year.",
        "As a consequence, product prices are also expected to increase.",
        "The bimonthly survey of consumers conducted in the first fortnight of July also points to the widely shared perception of the prevailing high rate of inflation one-year ahead, although the percentage of respondents who expect the rate to decline has increased compared to the previous survey in May 2022.",
        "The RBI Survey of Inflation Expectations of Households also conducted in the first fortnight of July shows that the 3 months ahead and one year ahead median expected inflation rates have declined from the expectations held in May.",
        "However, by a qualitative measure, the percentage of respondents expecting a decline in inflation rate 3 months ahead or one year ahead is far below the percentages who expect the rate to increase or stay similar.",
        "These sample survey results show some signs of expectations of decline in future inflation rates but the optimism is guarded.",
        "The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in the second fortnight of July 2022 projects a CPI inflation rate of 6 per cent or above in the remaining three quarters of FY 2022-23.",
        "The present pattern of trends and assessments suggest a gradual decline in inflation rate during FY 2022-23 but still above the upper level of the tolerance band around the target of 4 per cent.",
        "Going forward, the food inflation scenario would be affected by the overall rainfall conditions in the remaining period of the present monsoon and the crop prospects, besides the global price conditions.",
        "The easing of global prices in the case of energy and other raw materials may soften the prices in the non-food sectors although there may still be pressures from the incomplete pass through of the higher input prices that prevailed.",
        "The upside risks to any declining inflation trajectory in the short term are significant.",
        "Taking into account these trends, for FY 2022-23, the headline CPI inflation rates have been projected at 7.1 per cent for Q2, 6.4 per cent for Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4.",
        "The projected inflation rate for FY 2022-23 is at 6.7 per cent, the same as in the June MPC meeting.",
        "The global economic conditions have turned unfavourable for growth from the combined shocks of the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued shadow of Covid 19 across countries and the tightening of monetary policies to rein in inflation in many countries.",
        "The revised projections by the International Monetary Fund for 2022, released in July, place world GDP growth at 3.2 per cent, sharp drop from 4.4 per cent projected in January 2022 and 3.6 per cent in April 2022.",
        "The world trade volume of goods and services is now projected to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022 over the previous year, a decline from 6 per cent projected in January and 5 per cent in April 2022.",
        "Deceleration in growth, particularly in the major economies of the world would have an adverse impact on their imports.",
        "The spill over effects on imports of other countries are also adverse.",
        "The monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies has also led to capital outflow from the emerging economies, including India.",
        "The elevated levels of crude oil prices and the rising prices of natural gas in the international markets has meant rising import costs raising trade deficit.",
        "The worsening global economic conditions have come at a time for us when the domestic economy was beginning to sustain its growth momentum after regaining the output level in 2021-22 from the shocks of the Covid 19 pandemic.",
        "Performance of a number of sectors showed sustained growth in Q1: FY 2022-23, particularly in manufacturing.",
        "Although IIP for April-May 2022 was only 4.0 per cent above the same period in 2019, it was 12.9 per cent YOY basis.",
        "The PMI for manufacturing has remained in the expansion zone for April-June and rose further in July.",
        "In the case of services also, PMI rose from April to June but fell in July.",
        "Capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose above the long-term average in Q4: 2021-22 and the RBI Industrial Outlook Survey reflects expectations of steady improvement through Q4: 2022-23.",
        "Although there are concerns over demand conditions in the case of services and infrastructure sectors in H1, improvement in conditions is expected in H2: FY 2022-23.",
        "On the demand side, the RBI Survey of Consumer Confidence conducted in the first fortnight of July reflects continued caution by the consumers on non-essential spending.",
        "One year ahead from now, only about 30 per cent of the respondents expect to increase non-essential spending.",
        "The import of capital goods during January-June 2022 in terms of value in US$ are above the 2019, although IIP for capital goods is still below 2019 level for the same period.",
        "Export performance in both goods and services in 2021-22 was well above the 2019 levels and in Q1: FY 2022-23, exports exceeded the value, YOY basis as well.",
        "However, going forward, export performance would be affected by the global demand conditions, with strengthening dollar providing some incentive to exporters despite the higher cost of imported inputs.",
        "The recent data on indicators such as GST collections, E-way bills and non food credit indicate sustained momentum of economic activities.",
        "Although demand conditions may be restrained, the growth momentum has been sustained.",
        "Based on the overall economic activity conditions, the YOY GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent for FY 2022-23 projected in the June 2022 MPC meeting has been retained.",
        "The CPI inflation rate is in excess of 6 per cent in Q4: FY 2021-22 and Q1: FY 2022-23 and projected to be well above the target of 4 per cent in Q1: FY 2023-24.",
        "Both the GDP growth rate and inflation rate for FY 2022-23 have been retained at the same levels as in the June MPC meeting.",
        "There are significant uncertainties to both growth and inflation rates emanating from external and domestic factors.",
        "Sustaining the growth momentum will also require reduction in inflation rate.",
        "The prevailing inflation pressures, therefore, remain a concern and continued monetary policy measures are needed to ensure that the inflation rate is aligned with the target rate.",
        "Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.4 per cent.",
        "I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.",
        "The last three months show Indian growth sustaining despite continuing global shocks and rate rises.",
        "Indeed, India has done better than expected and in comparison to many countries under the pandemic and Ukraine war shocks.",
        "Among reasons for this are growing economic diversity that helps to absorb shocks.",
        "Large domestic demand can moderate a global slowdown; if industry suffers from lockdown, agriculture does well.",
        "Services compensate for less contact-based delivery with digitization, distance work and exports.",
        "Even if global growth slows, promote exports would support Indian exports.",
        "A rise in the current very small Indian share in world exports remains feasible.",
        "Another example of the value of diverse participants comes from the financial markets.",
        "Household SIPs in stock markets have compensated for FPI outflow.",
        "Since the share of stocks in their financial assets is still low (4 per cent compared to 27 per cent for US households) there is room for this to rise further safely and give households higher returns in a better diversified portfolio.",
        "Other types of diversity in the financial sector are improving stability.",
        "The repo rate rise, which is reversing the large pandemic-induced cut of 115 bps in a more calibrated fashion, has not as yet slowed the recovery.",
        "Real rates remain negative and there are lags in pass through.",
        "Even so, rising rates may have prevented over-heating.",
        "Coordinated fiscal and monetary policy action to reduce inflation while maintaining adequate demand has worked well.",
        "Inflation has also moderated.",
        "FPI are returning because India has better prospects among emerging markets, and the crash in currency and stock markets that they were waiting for in order to re-enter is proving unlikely.",
        "Commodity inflation is finally softening, and is likely to continue with a global slowdown and supply-chain bottlenecks turning into gluts due to excess inventories with firms.",
        "In India there is some rise in industry wages, but corporate margins remain high.",
        "Large sales and softening of other input costs gives space to absorb moderate wage rise.",
        "Although the RBI enterprise survey shows corporates expect prices to rise, if demand falls it may moderate their ability to raise prices.",
        "Rural wage growth is flat at 4.8 per cent.",
        "Household inflation perceptions and expectations have fallen.",
        "Inflation, however, is still above the tolerance band, and shows signs of being so for the first 3 quarters of 2022-23.",
        "This can be destabilizing for inflation expectations.",
        "That policy responds strongly to ensure its inflation commitments is important for the credibility of an inflation targeting regime.",
        "Some rise in GST tax rates, electricity tariffs, energy costs and rupee depreciation, although the rupee is showing signs of mean reversion towards real equilibrium values, are short-term risks for inflation.",
        "Attempting a soft landing for the economy is important, however.",
        "For this, policy rates should not depart far from equilibrium.",
        "Such an outcome also balances between those who gain from a rise in rates and those who lose from it.",
        "In my last minutes I had suggested (-)1 per cent as the then lower limit for the one year ahead real repo rate.",
        "Shocks affect the steady-state natural interest rate[1].",
        "Policy has to tighten against negative supply shocks as well as against positive demand shocks that raise the equilibrium rate.",
        "My research showed Indian real rates were required to be negative in slumps but low positive in booms[2].",
        "The healthy recovery suggests we are no longer in a slump.",
        "Crude oil prices have fallen, but their persistence above positive territory.",
        "One year ahead inflation is expected to be around 5 per cent.",
        "Therefore, I vote for a 50 bps rise raising the repo rate to 5.4 per cent, and delivering the required low positive real rate.",
        "Since the real rate is now near neutral, but uncertainty and global risks to both growth and inflation remain high, policy has to carefully monitor incoming data and respond to current developments.",
        "Indeed, if the US Fed does that, tapering its rate rise with signs of a slowdown, it will reduce global risks.",
        "One of the first impacts of rising policy repo rates should be on credit demand as pass through raises loan rates.",
        "India is just coming out of a deleveraging cycle and recovery requires credit growth to rise.",
        "Despite rising repo rates in May and June 2022, yearly credit growth over the respective months in 2021 continues to be high partly due to the base effect.",
        "Preliminary sectoral credit data shows sharp rise in bank loans to the service sector but average of MSME, NBFC and personal bank loans over May and June was less than in April, and loans to large industry fell in June.",
        "There are pitfalls in monthly comparisons and the picture will be clearer as more data comes in.",
        "The rise in loan rates is still limited but has begun.",
        "defined in terms of liquidity also indicates that durable liquidity will continue to be in surplus.",
        "This reassurance is important in a period of risk-off and possible outflows as the Fed continues its quantitative tightening.",
        "The LAF system has enough instruments to sterilize any effect on domestic liquidity.",
        "The repo rate does not respond to the exchange rate.",
        "This is reducing exchange rate volatility, which can be too high in emerging markets under global shocks.",
        "Research shows that inflation targeting works better in developing economies if additional instruments are available to address excess exchange rate and capital flow volatility[3].",
        "India has many such instruments that can be activated if necessary.",
        "Moreover, the interest differential with the US has only a minor and possibly position include fixed income flows, as well as ECBs and institutional cross border borrowing.",
        "Of these $14bn left in 2020, and after that, even as the differential narrowed, have been steady at $100bn.",
        "A rise in Indian interest rates will not induce equity investment, which is the one that is currently volatile, to stay.",
        "In 2013 and in 2018 following the Fed rate rise aggravated the Indian slowdown.",
        "Today policy has more degrees of freedom to use.",
        "Similarly, multiple instruments are required and are available to keep the current account deficit at sustainable levels.",
        "A competitive equilibrium REER and demand-reducing positive real interest rates will also help.",
        "Inflation is at unacceptably high levels, and the projected trajectory is also above target during the entire forecast horizon.",
        "Economic growth has on the other hand proved resilient in the face of an adverse global environment.",
        "In this situation, there is clearly a need for front loaded hikes in the policy rate.",
        "The choice to my mind is between 50, 60 and 75 basis points.",
        "The logic of front loading argues in favour of a 75 basis point hike: it would establish the credibility of monetary policy beyond doubt, would help achieve a faster reduction in the inflation rate, and would hopefully reduce the terminal repo rate consistent with bringing inflation close to the target.",
        "Weighing against that is the fact that a 75 basis point rate hike is quite unusual (despite a few recent hikes of this magnitude globally in the recent period).",
        "In the context of market expectations of a panic, and could be unnecessarily disruptive.",
        "Also even with a 50 basis point hike this month, the cumulative tightening in the past few months of 140 basis points ahead.",
        "On balance, therefore, I do not favour a 75 basis point hike at this juncture.",
        "The choice between 50 and 60 basis points is less clear cut.",
        "The latter has the advantage of bringing the repo rate back to a round multiple of a quarter percent, but shares some of the disadvantage of a 75 basis point hike to a much lesser extent.",
        "As I have argued in past statements, 10 basis points is not material and I am happy to go along with the consensus of the rest of the MPC on this issue.",
        "Therefore, I vote in favour of increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent.",
        "I now turn to the second resolution to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.",
        "This statement confuses more than it clarifies.",
        "Because the rate accommodation.",
        "It can only mean withdrawal of the pre-pandemic accommodation that began with the rate cut from 6.50% to 6.25% in February 2019.",
        "A plain reading of this resolution would then be that the MPC is focused on taking the repo rate back to 6.50%.",
        "In my view, such an indication of a terminal repo rate of 6.50% is totally unwarranted in the situation that we are in.",
        "The reality is that the Ukraine war and monetary tightening in the advanced economies have led to a very serious risk of recession in the world economy.",
        "In the face of this, commodity prices have collapsed from their April peaks.",
        "Crude oil remained elevated for longer, but it too is softening even as the MPC meeting is in progress.",
        "If this trend continues, we could see significant downward adjustments to the projected inflation trajectory.",
        "Moreover, though the Indian economy has been highly resilient to geopolitical and commodity price shocks so far, the weakening of exports in July indicates that India would not be immune to growth shocks emanating from the rest of the world.",
        "In short, it is easy to imagine that a few months from now, the economic data could point to a terminal repo rate that is well below 6.50%.",
        "To focus on one thing implies paying less attention to other things, and I do not think it would be wise to say that the MPC will 45.",
        "I have made several different suggestions to the MPC regarding alternatives to this resolution.",
        "First, in June, I suggested that individual MPC members could start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate.",
        "Since these would be projections of individual members and not of the MPC as a whole, these projections would not tie the hands of the MPC itself in any way.",
        "At the same time, they would provide guidance to the public about the thinking within the MPC.",
        "Second, at this meeting, I suggested that this resolution should simply be dropped.",
        "It is better not to give any guidance than to give confusing guidance.",
        "Unfortunately, none of these proposals found favour with the other members.",
        "At the same time, I do not wish to record an outright dissent on this resolution because clearly further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted.",
        "The terminal repo rate may or may not be 6.50% but it is almost certainly well above 5.40%.",
        "So I am confining myself to expressing my reservations on this resolution.",
        "The resolution should in my view be interpreted only as stating that there is a high likelihood of further front-loaded tightening without restricting the freedom of the MPC to respond to the changing environment in a data driven manner.",
        "The risks to the global economy which were initially perceived as stagflationary are now increasingly surfacing to be that of an outright recession for most economies.",
        "This has fuelled a debate of hard[4] versus soft landing for the global economy.",
        "Central banks are thus confronted with trade-offs which are governed by both the magnitude as well as the timing of their policy tightening.",
        "While the need to rein in inflationary pressures without numbing the growth impulses remains a priority, central banks are treading a very narrow path and they will need a well-curated policy design for a safe and soft landing.",
        "Domestic inflation after reaching a peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022 moderated to 7.0 per cent in May-June 2022.",
        "A sequential tapering of the month-onmonth prices increases (momentum) along with large favourable base effects in May brought about this softening.",
        "Headline CPI price momentum eased to 0.94 per cent in May and further to 0.52 per cent in June from an elevated 1.43 per cent in April.",
        "Headline CPI on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) basis also slowed down from 12.8 per cent in April to 2.6 per cent in June.",
        "In terms of contributions, while the deceleration in headline price momentum in May was primarily on account of core (CPI excluding food and fuel), food also started to contribute to the slowdown in headline price pressures by June.",
        "The deceleration in price momentum was broadbased across items within the food group.",
        "On the other hand, the softening in core momentum was primarily influenced by the one-off petrol and diesel price declines (reflecting the full direct impact of excise duty cut).",
        "Despite some softening, various trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation[5] for June were elevated, in the range of 5.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent.",
        "In spite of some softening, diffusion indices[6] for core CPI items were also at elevated levels, implying that underlying price pressures remain broad based.",
        "Inflation expectations of households in India, being adaptive and backward looking and influenced mainly by price expectations of food and fuel items (which constitute almost 55 per cent of the CPI basket), moderated in the July 2022 round but remained at elevated levels.",
        "Unmooring of inflation expectations, in the context of the spike in inflation following the conflict in Europe, is the biggest risk which the back to target but at the cost of a recession.",
        "5 In trimmed mean measures, CPI items which are located in the tails of the inflation distribution for every month (indicating highly volatile inflation movements) are excluded.",
        "6 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices (seasonally adjusted) have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month and aggregates them to show whether the month-on-month (m-o-m) increase overall has been expansionary or contractionary.",
        "The diffusion indices MPC addressed through the off-cycle meet and frontloaded rate actions so as to increase the efficacy of the actions.",
        "Going forward, though the fall in international commodity prices and the progress of the monsoon provide room for optimism, there is considerable uncertainty, particularly from the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon and its implication for _kharif paddy production, the depreciation of the INR exchange rate_ 51.",
        "While WPI inflation rose sharply in line with international commodity price movements, the full pass-through of high inputs costs reflected in WPI to CPI inflation was tempered by weak pricing power due to the prevailing slack in the economy.",
        "As the slack wanes and pricing power of firms return, there is a risk that the passthrough of past increases in input costs could continue, partly offsetting the favourable impact of recent fall in global commodity prices.",
        "Crude price uncertainty persists, though the pass-through of elevated crude oil prices to retail inflation has been moderate and low in the recent period[7] due to the impact of fiscal interventions, such as reduction in excise duties.",
        "Moreover, the recent depreciation of the INR exchange rate could also temper the beneficial impact of fall in commodity prices.",
        "These could keep core CPI inflation at elevated levels throughout this year.",
        "Moreover, if high cost of living conditions persists, the household inflation expectations could edge up feeding into wages in a broad-based manner and pushing up services inflation, which has been muted so far.",
        "Thus, monetary policy needs to be watchful of the evolving input cost pass-through and wage dynamics and take pre-emptive action to contain any possibility of the emergence of a wage-price spiral.",
        "As mentioned in my minutes of June policy, we need to factor in quicker and improved monetary transmission with the introduction of the external benchmark regime in this tightening cycle while arriving at a terminal rate.",
        "In response to the interest rate cycle turning upwards, banks have swiftly increased their external benchmark linked lending rates (EBLRs) (by 90 bps) and the 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) (by 40 bps) during April-July, 2022.",
        "The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans has also increased.",
        "Though pass-through is relatively lower in case of retail term deposit rates, banks have increased their bulk deposit rates significantly.",
        "As credit growth is gathering momentum, banks can be expected to further increase rates on retail deposits to fund their lending.",
        "Moreover, with upward revisions in interest rates on small savings schemes (SSSs) in accordance with the formula-based mechanism as and when it happens, pressure will increase on banks to hike interest rates on retail deposits.",
        "On balance, the inflation projection for the financial year 2022-23 is retained at 6.7 per cent, with a gradual moderation in headline inflation over H2:2022-23.",
        "As per the baseline projections, inflation is likely to remain above 6 per cent till Q3:2022-23.",
        "This would require monetary policy to persevere with its exit from accommodation to ensure that frontloaded policy rate hikes dampen inflation expectations, anchor second round effects and firmly establish our commitment to price stability.",
        "The frontloading of policy actions is expected to strengthen monetary policy credibility and temper the need for aggressive rate hikes in future.",
        "Greater credibility makes disinflation less costly, helps hold down inflation once it is low (Blinder, 2000[8]).",
        "The dividends of establishing this credibility are not just in the contemporaneous transmission into the real economy, but also in lowering the necessary terminal policy 7 Based on time varying regression estimates of pass-through of crude oil price changes to CPI inflation.",

        "The global outlook becomes increasingly uncertain and tilted by downside risks.",
        "With inflation remaining elevated worldwide and a pervasive sense of guilt about the consequences of the pandemic stimulus having been underestimated[9], central banks have launched into the most aggressive, front loaded and synchronous monetary policy tightening in decades.",

        "The world is in the eye of a new storm originating from aggressive monetary policy tightening and even more aggressive forward guidance from advanced economy (AE) central banks.",

        "The need of the hour is calibrated monetary policy action, with a clear understanding that it is required for sustaining our medium-term growth prospects.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for raising the policy repo rate by 50 bps.",
        "As regards the stance, I vote for remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.",
        "It is important to note that even though the policy rate has moved to pre-pandemic levels, the overall monetary conditions taking into account the liquidity position and the inflation remain accommodative.",

        "The pass through to CPI, suggests that firms have not raised prices to the extent of input cost pressures.",

        "Evolving global inflation movements juxtaposed with our projections would suggest that monetary policy actions taken so far, supported by improvements in supply responses, could break the 7 per cent plus drift in average headline inflation and at best contain it in above target over the next 12 months.",

        "The risk of inflation eroding purchasing power and weakening consumer spending, especially on discretionary items, is becoming significant.",
        "Inflation expectations may also be stalling private investment in capacity creation, as reflected in corporate performance during the second quarter of 2022-23.",

        "This necessitates a constant vigil on prices.",
        "Our successive rate actions since May 2022 are working through the system.",
        "Considering the elevated inflation levels, especially the stickiness in core inflation, further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to contain build-up in underlying inflationary pressures, keep inflation expectations anchored, and bring inflation closer to the target rate of 4 per cent over the medium term.",

        "I am, therefore, of the view that a premature pause in monetary policy action would be a costly policy error at this juncture.",

        "The MPC raised the policy Repo rate by 40 basis points in its meeting held in May and RBI also announced an increase in CRR by 50 basis points.",
        "In view of the elevated levels of inflation rates which may persist given the disruptions international supply chains are experiencing, there is a need to ensure that policy rates are consistent with the requirements of moderating inflation expectations and liquidity conditions are consistent with the requirements of economic growth in an environment less constrained by the COVID pandemic.",
        "While the impact of these measures is likely to have some adverse impact on aggregate demand in the short term, moderating inflation pressures now is crucial to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment.",

        "There is worry about US inflation generalizing to the rest of the world, but we must remember Indian inflation differs.",
        "We did have much higher inflation than the US but that was in the past.",
        "The danger is Indian inflation is more susceptible to crude oil and food inflation triggered by the Ukraine war.",
        "Inflation is becoming broadbased but that is because rising transport and communication costs affect almost every product.",
        "But cost pass through is one-time.",
        "True second round effects require wages to rise.",
        "And since in India the majority still lives in rural areas, rural wages became sharply positive.",
        "A rise in raw material input prices raises food prices but input prices do not rise again because food prices have risen.",
        "But if a rise in rural wages raises food prices, the later raises wages further.",

        "During the pandemic many firms have economized on labour cost and the share of wages has gone down.",
        "Moreover, the aggregate supply curve is estimated to be flat so that prices do not rise much even if employment rises.",
        "Fourth, firms set prices as a mark-up on wages and other costs.",
        "But if demand is slack, they tend to reduce mark-ups or make other adjustments rather than pass on rising input prices to consumers.",
        "Corporate surveys show that input price indices have risen more than output price indices and yet mark-ups have remained constant.",
        "It is wage share that has fallen.",

        "There are some signs of softening in prices of global commodities apart from crude oil.",
        "At the current stage of recovery, however, the one-year ahead real rate must not be more negative than -1%.",
        "A fifty or sixty basis point hike would achieve this, while looking through part of the spike in 2022 even as further supply-side movement and clarity on global developments are awaited.",
        "Such a real interest rate, while not dampening the recovery much, will prevent a possibly inflationary further rise in demand and unsustainable current account deficit.",
        "Markets benefit from recovery and so are better able to absorb rate hikes that are in step with the latter.",
        "Given the above considerations I vote for a 50 bps rise in the repo rate.",
        "Further changes will depend on growth and inflation outcomes.",
        "Since future moves will either be a pause or a rise it is also useful to change the guidance to withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "I therefore vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.",
        "While the real repo rate is a useful guide to actions, and has theoretical clarity, it is difficult to estimate the neutral rate precisely.",

        "Under the external benchmark system, as it works currently, banks may not need to raise deposit rates commensurately until excess liquidity is sufficiently absorbed so that they have to borrow at the repo.",
        "If excess liquidity persists, yet policy rates rise, the ECB multi-tier excess reserve system[2] is an option.",
        "Higher rates paid on a part of reserves held at the central bank could be conditional on banks passing on a share of this to depositors.",
        "In my statement during the May meeting, I called for more than 100 basis points of rate increases to be carried out very soon.",
        "Taking into account the 40 basis points hike in May, my preference would have been for an increase of 60 basis points in this meeting.",
        "However, I have decided to go along with the majority view of 50 basis points for the same reason as in May: a difference of opinion of 10 basis points is not material enough to be elevated to a dissent.",
        "Hence, I vote in favour of raising the policy repo rate to 4.90%.",
        "I stated in May that the MPC has a lot of catching up to do, and that remains true today.",
        "Between April and now, the MPC has raised the policy rate by 90 basis that we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place, and to go anywhere we must run even faster.",
        "Clearly, more needs to be done in future meetings to bring the real policy rate to a modestly positive level consistent with the emerging inflation and growth dynamics.",
        "I am therefore happy that the second resolution is clearer than the May resolution that I had described then as pedantically correct but falling short in communicative efficacy.",
        "The resolution no longer talks about remaining accommodative, and confines itself to remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "I therefore vote in favour of this resolution.",
        "It appears to me however that as the MPC navigates this process of withdrawal, there is merit in signalling the likely pace of this tightening in more quantitative terms.",
        "Many leading central banks currently provide forecasts of the future path of the policy rate several quarters ahead.",
        "The MPC has now accumulated several years of experience, and the RBI has evolved into a mature inflation targeting central bank.",
        "I believe that the time is therefore ripe for MPC members to start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate.",
        "This would help stabilize long term bond markets and also anchor inflation expectations.",

        "Notably, 51 HFIs out of more than 70 that are monitored to track real economic activity (both from demand and supply side) have crossed their pre-pandemic (2019-20) levels.",
        "While 37 HFIs have exceeded their pre-pandemic levels by more than 10 per cent, 30 HFIs have surpassed it by over 20 per cent.",
        "Overall, growth drivers seem to be holding up despite higher inflation and tightening monetary conditions.",
        "The surge in inflation by 84 basis points in April to 7.8 per cent was accompanied by broad-based momentum effects (month-on-month price increase) covering food, fuel and core categories.",
        "Six out of 12 food sub-groups and 8 out of 10 groups/sub-groups in core registered a pick-up in inflation.",
        "Overall, around 78 per positive price increases and those for price increases at or above a seasonally range of 6.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent.",
        "The weighted median (inflation relating to the 50[th] percentile by weight) also increased further by 40 bps to 6.5 per cent in April.",
        "Given the severity and extent of generalisation of inflation as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, average CPI inflation during 2022-23 is now projected at 6.7 per cent, an increase of one percentage point (100 bps) from 5.7 per cent indicated in the April 2022 policy.",

        "With protracted geopolitical tensions and no early resolution of the conflict in sight, considerable uncertainty clouds the evolving inflation trajectory.",
        "While the supply side measures taken by the government would undeniably alleviate some cost-push pressures, it needs to be complemented by calibrated monetary policy actions to anchor inflation expectations and contain the broadening price pressures.",
        "Given inflation expectations in India are largely adaptive or backward looking, persistent supply disruptions and the resulting price pressures could get entrenched in higher inflation expectations.",
        "Since the short-term trade-off between inflation and output worsens under high inflation expectations (the upward shift of the Phillips curve), this would call for front-loaded policy action to rein in inflation expectations.",
        "It is worthwhile to note that central bank credibility plays an important role in minimising direct impact, it is the second-round effects that central banks seek to address through the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations which, in turn, can deliver low and stable inflation over the medium-term.",

        "I also vote for withdrawal of accommodation to align inflation with the target going forward, while accommodation, it is consistent with the recent monetary policy actions to withdraw the extraordinary pandemic measures-infused liquidity.",
        "The measures taken so far have ensured that liquidity conditions evolve in alignment with the monetary policy stance and liquidity overhang does not pose additional risks to inflation.",
        "While frontloading policy measures, one needs to be aware that the pace of policy transmission has quickened after the introduction of the external benchmarkbased lending rates (EBLR) in October 2019.",
        "With more than 40 per cent of the total floating rate outstanding loans linked to external benchmarks, the degree of passthrough to actual lending rates has increased and this would strengthen monetary transmission in the current cycle.",
        "The inherent framework of the EBLR regime which propensity to pass-through policy rate changes to lending rates rather quickly, particularly during tightening cycles, may have to be factored to achieve the desired outcome during the current tightening phase.",
        "Of course, the trajectory of inflation going ahead will be an important determining factor.",

        "The battle would be lost but the war would have been won if India is able to bend down the future trajectory of inflation.",
        "This is attributable no less to the supply side measures undertaken by the Government; the tightening of the LAF corridor and introduction of the standing deposit facility in April 2022 as its floor at a rate 40 basis points higher than the fixed rate reverse repo; the 40 basis points raising of the policy rate in May along with the 50 basis points increase in the cash reserve ratio requirement; and the proposed 64.",
        "To reiterate, given the extraordinary circumstances driving up inflation the world over, our endeavour should be to bring down inflation into the tolerance band by the last quarter of 2022-23 or the first quarter of 2023-24 and progressively align it to the target during the course of 2023-24.",

        "Growth impulses, on the other hand, are broadly evolving in line with expectations as borne out by the available high-frequency indicators during April-May 2022.",
        "The forecast of a normal southwest monsoon, the improvement in employment conditions as reflected in the rates of labour force participation (LFP) and employment, the early results from RBI surveys indicating steady rise in capacity utilisation and improving non-food credit growth augur well for the growth outlook.",

        "Thus, while high inflation continues to be the major concern, revival of economic activity remains steady and is gaining traction.",
        "The time is appropriate to go for a further increase in the policy rate to effectively deal with inflation and inflation expectations.",

        "It is important in this context to note that the repo rate is still below the pre-pandemic level and the liquidity surplus is still higher than what it was prior to the pandemic.",
        "As our policy in recent months has been unambiguously focussed on withdrawal of accommodation, both in terms of liquidity and rates, the change in wording of stance should be seen as a continuation and fine-tuning of our recent approach.",
        "The withdrawal of accommodation, as I see it, would be non-disruptive to the process of recovery and would strengthen our ongoing efforts to combat inflation and anchor inflation expectations."

        "Previous version available at: 5 While an IMF study in 2014 found causality from headline to core inflation, subsequent studies all find a reversal.",
        "The time taken for convergence depends on shocks, but the direction does not reverse.",
        "It can be faster despite shocks to the extant inflation expectations are more anchored, George, A.T., Bhatia, S., John, J., & Das, P. 2024.",
        "RBI Bulletin February: 101-116 to target inflation.",
        "Competitive forecasts are an important discipline in a FIT regime.",
        "Core is less volatile than headline but correct forecasts require an understanding of how new data acts in the Indian structure.",
        "While there are risks, there are also reasons to expect moderation in future investment reducing bottlenecks and logistics costs; resilience rising with development and diversity; _El Nino changing to_ _La Nina; the impact of substitution_ away from oil, of LPG and petrol-diesel price cuts and falling weights of volatile price items such as food in consumption baskets.",
        "Even if the NIR is raised to 1.5% because of abundant caution since steady growth allows a focus on reaching the inflation target the real policy rate is above it at 2% even in terms of expected FY25 headline inflation (4.5%); and even higher in terms of expected core inflation.",
        "Despite a cut in repo rates policy will still be contractionary.",
        "In the current situation of many types of uncertainty, however, maintaining stability must have priority.",
        "Therefore, I continue to vote for a pause in the repo rate and for an unchanged stance.",
        "Giving indications of the future repo rate is not compatible with data-based guidance and can create unnecessary market turbulence as it has in the US.",
        "Policy continues to be forward-looking since it responds to how data affects published inflation and growth forecasts.",
        "Its reaction function should by now be well understood by markets, giving them adequate guidance.",
        "The tightness in market liquidity has abated.",
        "Such tightness affects short rates more, which have little effect on aggregate demand and inflation.",
        "Under FIT, policy transmission occurs best through keeping the repo rate at an appropriate level, determined by domestic factors.",
        "Rates transmit through both banks and markets.",
        "For example, non-food credit of banks as a % of annual flow of resources available to the commercial sector has averaged 44.3% over 2007-23.",
        "Competition from other sources may mean less than full transmission of policy repo to loan rates, but points to growing diversity, maturity, fall in spreads and rising efficiency in the Indian financial sector.",
        "Market rates also rise with repo rates.",
        "My views are largely the same as in the last meeting (February 2024) and so I will be brief.",
        "Despite an uptick in crude oil prices, the outlook for inflation continues to sufficient to glide inflation to the target of 4%.",
        "The current real policy rate of 2% (based on projected inflation for 2024-25) is therefore excessive.",
        "This unwarrantedly high real rate imposes significant costs on the economy because of the short run Phillips curve.",
        "The fact that economic growth in 2024-25 is projected to slow by over half a percent relative to 2023-24 is a reminder that high interest rates entail a growth sacrifice.",
        "Monetary policy should try to reduce this sacrifice while ensuring that inflation (a) remains within the band and (b) glides towards the target.",
        "I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the stance to neutral.",
        "In my last statement of February 2024, I had explained clearly why no easing in stance or rate was desirable at that time.",
        "Now between last policy and this policy, what has changed.",
        "Real GDP growth has turned out to be firmer with stronger momentum, better than all projections, as per the Second Advance Estimates (SAE) released after February policy.",
        "There seems to be minimal scarring of growth due to the pandemic or monetary tightening.",
        "CPI headline inflation moderation remains on anticipated lines, though the diverging trajectory between food and core inflation continues.",
        "Food inflation remained a hostage to vegetable prices due to shallower winter season price correction, which could linger due to the likely above normal temperatures during the summer.",
        "Core inflation softened further since the last policy.",
        "This has been broad based across goods and services and almost universal, across all exclusion-based measures of core as well as statistical trimmed mean measures.",
        "[7] Besides, it is driven by lower price momentum.",
        "[8] While low core inflation would further the disinflation process, concerns remain on food inflation outlook.",
        "We need to remain watchful on upside risks to inflation outlook from adverse climatic factors, supply side shocks and geopolitical events.",
        "Going ahead, while monetary policy seems to be on the right track, it is too early to ease guard against inflation.",
        "It is important that we gain more confidence on our macro numbers for 2024-25 and their nuances.",
        "We are just at the beginning of the financial year.",
        "The financial year 2022-23 is not far behind when all our events.",
        "Few months into the year, we will have clarity on monsoon and its spatial distribution, impact of expected hot weather in the current quarter, _rabi production_ and procurement and kharif sowing, all of which are critical to shape up the growthinflation balance in 2024-25.",
        "Crude outlook is fast changing with the changing perceptions on demand supply in line with the geopolitics and developments in the middle east, which is on the edge.",
        "Besides, led by global developments, input prices are showing signs of an uptick, which needs to be watched.",
        "Return of inflation to the 4 per cent target is our objective and having come this far, it is not far from sight.",
        "We need to utilise the space provided by stronger growth to focus on inflation.",
        "Our own history, including that of many other emerging market economies (EMEs), shows that taking any risk on inflation front leads to huge price in terms of unhinging of inflation expectations that elongates the inflation episodes and makes the price stability task more daunting.",
        "Globally, market expectation of an early and faster rate cut by advanced some uncertainty on market perceptions of timing of policy easing cycle in major economies.",
        "In India, however, market expectations at present seem to be closely mile of disinflation process when beliefs are consistent with the policy regime contributing towards anchoring of long-term expectations.",
        "[9] Therefore, even if the and February 2024, with weighted median moderating from 4.1 per cent in December to 3.6 per cent in February.",
        "8 CPI core momentum (on a Seasonally Adjusted Annualised Rate -SAAR basis) moderated to 2.4 per cent in February 2024 from 3.1 per cent in January.",
        "current upside risks to price stability were to materialise, largely pertaining to the noncore components from uncertain food or international commodity prices, anchored inflation expectations may lower the pass through of such shocks[10] with benefits that go beyond monetary policy.",
        "To conclude, in recent years the series of large and unfavourable supply prices and output, which were moving in adverse directions.",
        "The MPC has utilised situation in which this trade off seems to have blurred with inflation on a declining expectations.",
        "This approach has stood us in good stead despite challenges and we need to persevere with this for its merits.",
        "To recall, just before we embarked on the path of monetary tightening, it was our endeavour then not to give up the accommodative policy setting till growth takes root and becomes self-sustaining.",
        "The fall out is that today growth is on a sustainable path despite monetary tightening.",
        "On a similar footing, ensuring a durable downward trajectory of inflation towards the 4 per cent target backed by this approach is the best way to address the transition challenges.",
        "Instead of haste for policy action, patience is the need of the hour.",
        "Hence, I vote for status quo on rate and stance in this policy.",
        "Recent inflation prints and high frequency data on salient food prices indicate that food inflation risks remain elevated.",
        "A relatively shallow and short-lived winter trough is giving way to a build-up of price momentum as summer sets in, with forecasts of rising temperatures up to May 2024.",
        "Some global food prices are firming up in an environment of rising input costs and supply chain pressures.",
        "The headroom provided by the steady core disinflation and fuel price deflation does not assure a faster alignment of the headline with the target.",
        "Consequently, headline inflation can be expected to remain in the upper reaches of the tolerance band until favourable base effects come into play in the second quarter of 2024-25.",
        "Hence, conditions are not yet in place for any let-up in the restrictive stance of monetary policy.",
        "Downward pressure on inflation must be maintained until a better balance of risks becomes evident and the layers of uncertainty clouding the near-term clear away.",
        "In the interregnum, the commitment to enduringly aligning inflation with the target of 4 per cent needs to be emphasised.",
        "Stabilising inflation expectations is progressing, as reflected in forward-looking surveys; anchoring them is crucial for achieving the inflation target.",
        "Domestic demand is expanding, and the output gap has closed.",
        "The investment outlook is improving; however, a stronger revival in private consumption and in corporate sales growth may await greater confidence that inflation is declining.",
        "The recent improvement in export performance, if sustained, will ease the drag on aggregate demand.",
        "11 Anchoring inflation expectations increases FDI, helps stabilise output and employment.",
        "Helder Ferreira de 12When economy is driven by only demand shocks, price stability and output stabilisation would warrant monetary 50.",
        "Supply responses are also improving, but they will be contingent on a normal monsoon; an upturn in the private investment cycle to boost manufacturing sales and ease capacity constraints; and on sustaining the trend growth of services.",
        "The external balance sheet is strong, with a modest current account deficit, ebullient capital flows and rising foreign exchange reserves.",
        "This should insulate domestic economic activity from global spillovers in response to regime shifts in monetary policy stances of systemic central banks that are either underway or imminent.",
        "Nevertheless, financial stability risks to macroeconomic outcomes in India have to be closely and continuously monitored, and pre-emptively headed off.",
        "Overall, price stability has to be restored in order to ensure that the rising growth trajectory that India is embarking upon is sustained.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for status quo on the policy rate and for perseverance with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "The Indian economy is growing at a robust pace with an average annual growth of 8 per cent during the last three years.",
        "India continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, supported by an upturn in investment cycle and revival in manufacturing.",
        "Services sector continues to grow at a strong pace.",
        "CPI headline inflation during January-February 2024 (5.1 per cent in each of the months) has moderated from the elevated level seen in December 2023 (5.7 per cent).",
        "The persistent and broad-based softening in CPI core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel inflation) by 180 bps since June 2023 is driving the disinflation process, though volatile and elevated food inflation is disrupting its pace.",
        "Looking ahead, the baseline projections show inflation moderating to 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 from 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 and 6.7 per cent in 2022-23.",
        "This success in the disinflation process should not distract us from the vulnerability of the inflation trajectory to the frequent incidences of supply side shocks, especially to food inflation due to adverse weather events and other factors.",
        "Overlapping food price shocks, apart from imparting volatility to headline inflation, may also result in spillovers to core inflation.",
        "Lingering geo-political tensions and their impact on commodity prices and supply chains are also adding to uncertainties in the inflation trajectory.",
        "These considerations call for monetary policy actions to tread the last mile of disinflation with extreme care.",
        "The growth prospects of the Indian economy in 2024-25 look bright.",
        "Expectations of normal southwest monsoon in 2024 augur well for the agricultural sector and rural demand.",
        "Strengthening rural demand, along with rising consumer confidence and optimism on employment and income, are expected to boost private consumption.",
        "Prospects of the manufacturing and services sectors also remain bright.",
        "Upbeat business outlook of firms, healthy corporate and bank balance sheets, upturn in private capex cycle with capacity utilisation ruling above the long period average can be expected to give further boost to domestic investment activity.",
        "Improving global growth and international trade prospects may provide thrust to external demand.",
        "Given these growth inflation dynamics, I believe that the extant monetary policy setting is well positioned.",
        "Market expectations are also closely aligned with that of the MPC.",
        "Monetary policy transmission is continuing and inflation expectations of households are also getting further anchored.",
        "At this stage, we should stay the course and remain vigilant.",
        "The gains in disinflation achieved over last two years have to be preserved and taken forward towards aligning the headline inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis.",
        "The strong growth momentum, together with our GDP projections for 2024-25, give us the policy space to unwaveringly focus on price stability.",
        "Price stability is our mandated goal and it sets strong foundations for a period of high growth.",
        "Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the focus on withdrawal of accommodation.",

        "Commodity price trends in the international markets present a mixed pattern.",
        "In the case of agricultural prices, in April and May, wheat prices have advanced, rice prices have remained firm and sugar and palm oil prices have shown decline.",
        "In the case of other commodities, energy prices have been volatile and metals have increased.",
        "Improving world manufacturing output, divergent weather conditions and uncertainties over the impact of the on-going geopolitical conflicts will continue to influence the world commodity prices in the short term.",

        "The early results from the ongoing enterprise surveys by the RBI for April-June point to rising input price pressures in 2023-24, particularly in services and infrastructure.",
        "Input price pressures are also followed by expectation of rise in selling prices by majority of the respondents in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors.",
        "The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI, referred earlier, provides an assessment of headline inflation in 2024-25.",
        "The median YOY CPI inflation rate in 2024-25 estimated from the survey is 4.5 per cent, the same level as CPI excluding food, fuel and pan, tobacco and intoxicants is below 4 per cent.",
        "Taking into account these factors, the headline inflation rate has now been projected at 4.5 per cent in 2024-25, the same level as in the April MPC meeting.",
        "The quarterly projections are 4.9 per cent in Q1, declining to 3.8 per cent in Q2, rising to 4.6 per cent in Q3 and 4.5 per cent in Q4.",
        "The sharp decline in Q2: 2024-25 corresponds to the period when inflation rate was a high 6.4 per cent in 2023-24.",
        "The headline inflation rate gradually moving to below 5 per cent mark in March and April, and projected at less than 4 per cent mark in Q2, marks an important macroeconomic condition that can support sustained growth.",
        "Clearly, the moderate inflation rate will have to be durable to be an effective condition for sustained growth.",
        "In this context, the policy would have to continue its focus on maintaining the inflation rate aligned to the target over the medium term.",
        "The rise in projected inflation rate above the 4.5 per cent mark in H2 of the financial year reflects the underlying price pressures, which if not addressed would not meet the policy goal.",
        "As a major part of these price pressures relate to food inflation, a watchful approach is appropriate to ensure that there are no spillovers of high food inflation to the prices of the other items in the consumption basket.",
        "As the aggregate output projections for 2024-25 reflect strong GDP growth, keeping the monetary policy focus on achieving the inflation target on a durable basis is appropriate at this juncture.",
        "With these considerations, I vote i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii.",
        "to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth.",
        "Indian growth has outperformed expectations once again, suggesting it has strong roots.",
        "Real policy rates near neutral, along with supply-side action, have been important in sustaining growth while bringing inflation towards target.",
        "As argued in earlier minutes, the neutral real policy rate (NIR) is around unity in Indian conditions of high unemployment and an ongoing transition to higher productivity employment[1].",
        "Headline inflation has been around 5% since January this year while core inflation has been below 4% since December 2023.",
        "Volatile commodity prices, El Nino and heat waves have not been able to reverse the approach to target.",
        "The headline inflation projection of 4.5% for 2024-25 gives an average real repo rate of 2% implying that the real repo rate will be above neutral for too long if the repo rate stays unchanged.",
        "Falling inflation has raised real repo above unity.",
        "This will reduce real growth rate with a lag.",
        "Expected growth is around 7% in 2024-25 below the 8% achieved in 2023-24[2].",
        "Status quoism is praised as being cautious.",
        "But if doing nothing distorts real variables it aggravates shocks instead of smoothing them and raises risk.",
        "Again, as argued earlier, in Indian conditions of growth transition, inflation itself is the best measure of potential growth.",
        "If headline inflation is approaching the target and core inflation is below target, and incoming data supports this[3], it implies growth is below potential and NIR above neutral; so real policy rates can safely fall.",
        "Potential output and NIR defined by inflation require the repo rate to fall with inflation.",
        "It cannot be correct to allow monetary policy to become more restrictive the nearer inflation gets to its target.",
        "Inflation has come down in the past through supply side action and anchoring of inflation expectations with the NIR at neutral, without a large growth sacrifice.",
        "Why then would higher real policy rates be required now to fight inflation that is lower?",
        "The sacrifice ratio from NIR above neutral is very high when aggregate supply is elastic as it is in India.",
        "Let us examine some common arguments made against cutting the repo rate.",
        "First, the fear of recurrent supply shocks.",
        "The volatilities facing policy in April have moderated.",
        "Global uncertainties continue, but the world seems to have learnt to live with them.",
        "Output and trade growth is improving.",
        "Conflicts have been contained and international oil prices that are important for India are softening despite extension commodity inflation is mixed, palm oil inflation, that affects many consumer goods costs in India, is softening.",
        "1 KLEMS data shows total factor productivity (TFR) for manufacturing and services increased at a higher pace during 2015-16 to 2019-20 (5 years) as compared to that during 2010-11 to 2014-15 (5 years).",
        "This helps absorb higher costs without requiring prices to rise and reduces the NIR despite higher growth.",
        "2 The 8% growth was not due to base effects, which had raised Q1 growth after the pandemic year.",
        "But in 2023-24 growth rates was even through all the quarters.",
        "The good monsoon predicted has already set in and will likely reduce food inflation.",
        "The elections are over.",
        "Results suggest political stability but also policy continuity rather than disruptive changes.",
        "India gets a credible opposition, which strengthens democracy.",
        "Even so, a conservative government with a good implementation record will return and is likely to continue with fiscal consolidation through a better composition of expenditure and other short and long-term cost reducing supply-side reforms.",
        "In addition to a lower probability of a large supply shock, the experience of the past year shows supply shocks no longer have persistent effects on inflation or on inflation expectations.",
        "We have waited for one year to watch the impact of these shocks, now it is time to move on.",
        "Household inflation expectations have become much less volatile in the post-pandemic period, falling slowly along with inflation itself.",
        "Some anchoring seems to have made them immune to transient shocks.",
        "Moreover, a durable approach to the inflation target is consistent with a transient rise in inflation.",
        "It is necessary to avoid the mistake of 2015 when international crude oil prices fell substantially but the fear that they would rise again prevented an adequate cut in the policy rate.",
        "Real interest rates rose substantially and hurt growth.",
        "The second set of arguments is since growth is robust there is no need for a cut.",
        "But growth is below potential and may slow further since consumption remains weak.",
        "Increasing income and employment is the only sustainable way to bolster consumption, as well as private investment.",
        "Transfers from a small percentage cannot give prosperity to a billion people.",
        "Reducing unemployment is important for political and financial stability.",
        "Without a rise in productive employment, aggressive redistribution becomes more likely and may provoke a flight of wealth taking India back to the stagnant seventies.",
        "But will lower repo rates raise already high personal credit growth too much?",
        "Over the last two years overall credit growth has been around 15% per annum.",
        "This implies a mild rise in credit ratios since nominal GDP growth is about 12%.",
        "Indian private credit ratios have to rise safely and steadily towards levels in peer countries, avoiding the type of debt explosion that accompanied Chinese growth.",
        "Seasonally adjusted monthly momentum in credit growth is slowing somewhat since January 2024 especially as sectoral prudential regulation moderates building up of excessive leverages.",
        "This regulation is preventive and reduces the need for monetary rate action that has broad effects[4].",
        "Spreads are high in India.",
        "Average loan rates are in double digits.",
        "While risk based pricing is required, a cut in repo rates will prevent retail interest rates rising to unbearable levels.",
        "There may be some stress in loans to self-employed.",
        "If leverage is rising, lower interest rates reduce costs and a possible indebtedness trap.",
        "Despite some initial reduction after a repo cut, rising loan demand and slower deposit growth will tend to raise both loan and deposit rates.",
        "Third, is the belief, widespread in financial markets that India cannot cut before the US Fed.",
        "But the US has its own special problems that do not apply elsewhere.",
        "index inclusion and ratings upgrade add to the many reasons that make interest narrowing again.",
        "Finally, let us turn to the mechanics of cutting and the communication around it.",
        "At present only small steps are required to align the repo with the fall in inflation so this should not be seen as the start of a rate cut cycle.",
        "Communication should make it clear that there is no softening path and forward-guidance remains data-determined.",
        "A neutral stance is appropriate since the rate can then move in either direction as required.",
        "In line with the above reasoning, I vote for a 25 basis points cut to the repo rate and a change in the stance to neutral.",
        "Even with these changes, monetary policy would remain disinflationary towards bringing inflation credibly to the target.",
        "In my statement for the last meeting (April 2024), I expressed concern about the growth sacrifice in 2024-25 induced by restrictive monetary policy.",
        "It now appears that the maintenance of restrictive policy for unwarrantedly long will lead to a growth sacrifice in 2025-26 as well.",
        "Professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI are projecting growth both in 2025-26 and in 2024-25 to be lower than in 2023-24 by more than 0.75%, and lower than the potential growth rate (of say 8%) by more than 1%.",
        "This is an unacceptably high growth sacrifice considering that headline inflation is projected to be only about 0.5% above target, and core inflation is extremely benign.",
        "As I have stated in the last several meetings, the current real policy rate of around 2% (based on projected inflation) is well above the level needed to glide inflation to its target.",
        "I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the stance to neutral.",
        "The arguments made in my last statement are still valid.",
        "In a transition phase, inflation to the target with more incoming information; Consistency that rules out more relevant.",
        "On the whole, we are broadly in a similar monetary policy setting as in the last two bi-monthly reviews.",
        "Growth continues to be robust and has surprised further on the upside.",
        "While core inflation has softened further, food inflation risks have remained elevated.",
        "Our growth projection for 2024-25 has been revised upward for the following reasons.",
        "First, GDP recorded a strong momentum (quarter-on-quarter growth) of 7.8 per cent in Q4:2023-24 as against an average of 5.8 per cent during the corresponding quarters of the pre-COVID period (2012-13 to 2019-20).",
        "Even the momentum of gross value added (GVA) was strong at 5.7 per cent during Q4:2023-24 in comparison with the average momentum of 2.4 per cent during the same preCOVID period.",
        "This strong momentum is likely to continue supporting growth in 202425.",
        "The available high frequency indicators for April-May exhibits optimism to sustain momentum.",
        "Second, private consumption which was trailing will now get impetus from rebound in rural demand on the back of expected above normal south-west monsoon and improving agriculture sector.",
        "Third, external demand is witnessing a turn around with improving outlook for global trade.",
        "In April, merchandise exports entered into positive territory and services exports posted robust double-digit growth.",
        "Moreover, KLEMS database available for 2021-22 shows that total factor productivity has leading to higher productivity, along with favourable demography, rising labour force participation and accelerated capital formation seems to have led to higher potential growth as I have been highlighting in my last four statements.",
        "Perhaps lower pressures from core inflation and the lower current account deficit in a scenario of high growth could be a pointer to it.",
        "Of course, monetary policy along with lower input costs have been the main driver of core disinflation.",
        "On the inflation front, headline and core inflation have moderated on anticipated lines.",
        "There is, however, little comfort in the near-term with inflation projected to remain sticky at around 4.9 per cent in Q1:2024-25 primarily due to the impact of unprecedented heat wave conditions on summer crop of vegetables and fruits; lower agricultural and horticulture production estimates; revision in milk prices across major cooperatives; and signs of a turnaround in commodity prices along with logistics and transportation costs.",
        "Food, with a weight of 45.9 per cent in CPI, contributed to threefourths of the headline inflation in April 2024 compared to about 40 per cent a year ago.",
        "Discounting the likely one-off drop in inflation to below target rate in Q2:2024-25 due to favourable base effects, the ongoing disinflation process, though gradual, is expected to continue over the second half of 2024-25, with headline inflation projected at 4.5 per cent by Q4:2025-26.",
        "Realisation of a normal monsoon, particularly in terms of its spatial and temporal distribution, and the recharge of reservoirs would be critical for the continued disinflation in food and headline CPI.",
        "Against this backdrop, let me elaborate more on why we cannot afford any misjudgement on our policy action at this stage.",
        "First, while we can draw some comfort from headline inflation running within the tolerance band successively for eight months in a row, we cannot drop our guard as the headline inflation is still not aligned to the target.",
        "Repeated incidence of food price shocks is delaying the final descent of inflation to the target.",
        "It is, however, encouraging that elevated food inflation over the last six months have not spilled over into core inflation, reflecting the gains from credibility of our maturing flexible inflation targeting framework.",
        "Nevertheless, given the large share of food in the household consumption basket, we need to stay vigilant to resist any such spill over and ensure that such price pressures are clearly dissipated.",
        "Any consideration on policy change has to factor in this aspect to avoid backpedalling in future.",
        "Second, there could be an argument that a pause for eight successive policies is a long pause.",
        "Let me emphasise, the inertia of inaction should not drive us to action.",
        "Rather the driving force should be the macroeconomic setting of growth and inflation.",
        "Clearly, the favourable growth-inflation balance and the outlook is pointing towards status quo.",
        "That said, even though the repo rate has been kept unchanged since February 2023, several policy actions on liquidity, transmission and communication have played out to stabilise the economy further.",
        "The views and assessment of all major stakeholders seem to be closely aligned towards no action at this stage.",
        "In any case, we do not face the kind of pressures being faced by some advanced economies which have gone for very restrictive policy settings in the current rate hike cycle.",
        "Third, it is also being argued that with the fisc consolidating, monetary policy should be more growth supportive by easing policy rates.",
        "The counter argument is higher revenues including dividend, which is the case now, the adverse impact on growth may be non-existent.",
        "On the contrary, fiscal consolidation may actually be growth enhancing if it leads to improved country ratings, easing the financial conditions for the private sector and improving the overall sentiment.",
        "(b) More importantly, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to long-term growth is via price stability.",
        "[6] In this context, I stand by what I said in my last minutes that we need to utilise the space provided by stronger growth to focus on inflation.",
        "To sum up, our monetary policy actions should continue to be primarily guided by domestic macroeconomic conditions and the outlook.",
        "The growth-inflation mix at the current juncture allows us to move more cautiously on the inflation front.",
        "Hence, we should not waver from our focus on price stability which remains so important for our long term sustained growth outcome.",

        "Domestic demand should continue to drive the economy, with private consumption receiving a fillip from the revival in rural spending.",
        "Corporate balance sheets are showing rising investments in fixed assets, which should find expression in a fuller capital spending upturn.",
        "With output in broad balance in relation to its potential, monetary policy can remain neutral to growth at this juncture and stay focused on aligning inflation to the target.",
        "That objective remains incomplete, which can undermine medium-term growth prospects.",
        "The speed of the easing of inflation has been disappointing so far, even from a cross-country perspective.",
        "Food prices are persisting for too long as the principal impediment to a faster disinflation.",

        "I do not believe that such a high real rate is required at this stage to drive inflation down to the target of 4%.",
        "It is true that economic growth is holding up well, but there is no evidence at all that the economy is overheating.",
        "Perhaps, the majority of the MPC worry that the output gap has already closed, and that the projected growth rate of 7% for 2024-25 exceeds the growth potential of the Indian economy.",

        "This opens up space for monetary easing without risking an inflationary spiral.",
        "In my view, the time has come for the MPC to send a clear signal that it takes its dual mandate of inflation and growth seriously, and that it would not maintain a real interest rate that is significantly more than what is needed to achieve its target.",

        "Against this backdrop, I vote to maintain _status quo on rate and stance for the_ following reasons.",
        "First, it may be recalled that we had frontloaded our rate actions by raising the repo rate cumulatively by 250 bps during May 2022 to February 2023 unlike central banks in advanced economies and several emerging market economies where rate hikes were of much higher order.",
        "In April 2023, when we paused majority of market participants were still expecting the MPC to hike rates.",
        "In other words, we did not raise our interest rates to a very restrictive zone, unlike the 400-500 bps increase seen by western central banks.",
        "Second, given the growth-inflation dynamics, and the uncertainty related to the inflation path going ahead, it would be better to continue with _status quo to get more_ clarity on the current _rabi crop and upcoming monsoon rains to further reaffirm our_ conviction of a durable downward trajectory of inflation towards 4 per cent.",
        "Third, markets are currently running ahead of policy makers worldwide including India.",
        "Any change in policy direction is going to have a multiplier effect.",

        "5 The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans rose by 181 bps during the current tightening cycle 18 bps.",
        "Fourth, led by productivity improvement through digitalisation and formalisation of the economy, increased capital formation, favourable demography, and new drivers of allows us to move more cautiously on inflation front.",
        "Softer core inflation despite strong growth supports this argument.",
        "Fifth, successfully managing the final descent of inflation is the most challenging part of the journey and the history of past 100 inflation episodes teaches us that inflation shock, in general, tends to be persistent.",
        "What matters for success in defeating inflation is consistency and credibility of policy that helps firmly anchor inflation expectations.",
        "[7] Avoiding any pre-mature move will help us guard against the biggest challenge to credibility, i.e., having to backpedal later if faced with upside surprises to inflation.",
        "Finally, let me emphasise that today we are in a period of transition, which is a little delicate where neither forward guidance works nor pre-emptive policy actions.",
        "Expectations of a change make agents and market participants behave in a way as if the change has already happened, which makes managing the present even tougher.",
        "For example, very recently we saw that expectations of rate cuts by major advanced economies have made global markets very exuberant.",
        "This makes the job of central banks even more difficult, especially since the last leg of disinflation is still pending.",

        "According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.",
        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic decided to: - Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent.",
        "The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.",
        "- The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.",
        "These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "In the second quarter of 2023, the global economy is sustaining the momentum gained in the preceding quarter in spite of still elevated though moderating inflation, tighter financial conditions, banking sector stress, and lingering geopolitical conflicts.",
        "Sovereign bond yields are trading sideways on expectations of the imminent peaking of the tightening cycle of monetary policy while the US dollar has appreciated.",
        "Equity markets have remained range bound since the last MPC meeting.",
        "For several emerging market economies (EMEs), weak external demand, elevated debt levels and geoeconomic disintegration amidst tighter external financial conditions pose risks to growth prospects, although capital flows are cautiously returning to them on renewed risk appetite.",
        "According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office from 4.5 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) in Q3:2022-23 to 6.1 per cent in Q4, supported by fixed investment and higher net exports.",
        "Real GDP growth for 2022-23 was placed at 7.2 per cent, higher than the second advance estimate of 7.0 per cent.",
        "Domestic economic activity remains resilient in Q1:2023-24 as reflected in high indicated sustained expansion, with the manufacturing PMI at a 31-month high in May and services PMI at a 13-year high in April-May.",
        "In the services sector, domestic air passenger traffic, e-way bills, toll collections and diesel consumption exhibited buoyancy in April-May, while railway freight and port traffic registered modest growth.",
        "On the demand side, urban spending remains robust as reflected in indicators such as passenger vehicle sales and domestic air passenger traffic which recorded motorcycle sales expanded in April, while tractor sales contracted partly owing to unseasonal rains.",
        "Investment activity is picking up as reflected in the healthy expansion in steel consumption and cement output in April.",
        "Merchandise exports and non-oil nongold imports remained in contraction mode in April while services exports sustained a robust expansion.",
        "CPI inflation fell sharply to 4.7 per cent in April 2023 from 6.4 per cent in February on the back of large favourable base effects, with softening observed across all the three major groups.",
        "Food group inflation eased, with moderation in cereals, eggs, milk, fruits, meat and fish, spices and prepared meals inflation and deepening of deflation in edible oils.",
        "In the fuel group, inflation in LPG and firewood and chips prices fell and kerosene prices slipped into deflation.",
        "Core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) dipped, driven down by clothing and footwear, household goods and services, health, transport and communication, personal care and effects and recreation and amusement sub-groups.",
        "Going forward, the headline inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by food price dynamics.",
        "Wheat prices could see some correction on robust _mandi arrivals and_ procurement.",
        "Milk prices, on the other hand, are likely to remain under pressure due to supply shortfalls and high fodder costs.",
        "The forecast of a normal south-west monsoon by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) augurs well for _kharif crops; however, the_ spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon would need to be closely monitored to assess the prospects for agricultural production.",
        "Crude oil prices have eased but the surveys, manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms polled expect input costs and output prices to harden.",
        "A clearer picture will emerge when the final survey results are available.",
        "Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 4.6 per cent, Q2 at 5.2 per 13.",
        "The higher _rabi_ crop production in 2022-23, the expected normal monsoon, and the sustained buoyancy in services should support private consumption and overall moderation in commodity prices and robust credit growth are expected to nurture investment activity.",
        "Weak external demand, geoeconomic fragmentation, and protracted geopolitical tensions, however, pose risks to the outlook.",
        "Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8.0 per cent, Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",
        "The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.",
        "Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil.",
        "The progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.",
        "Domestic economic activity is holding up well.",
        "Consumer confidence is improving and businesses remain optimistic about the future.",
        "The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months.",
        "Monetary policy would need to be carefully calibrated for alignment of inflation with the target.",
        "Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent.",
        "The MPC resolved to continue keeping a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.",
        "It will take further monetary actions promptly and appropriately as required to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and to bring down inflation to the target.",
        "The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.",
        "unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent.",
        "Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.",
        "Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution.",
        "Since the April meeting of the MPC, the GDP growth numbers for FY 2022-23 have been updated and we also have the headline inflation numbers for April 2023.",
        "The official provisional estimates (PE) for GDP at constant prices place the GDP growth higher at 7.2 per cent for FY 2022-23 from 7 per cent in the Second Advance Estimates.",
        "The headline YOY inflation rate in April dropped to 4.7 per cent, well below the rate in March, 5.7 per cent.",
        "A significant part of the improvement in GDP in FY 2022-23 was due to the growth in Q4 FY 2022-23 at 6.1 per cent in comparison to the expectations of growth of 5.1 per cent implied by the overall growth rate of 7 per cent in SAE.",
        "The better than anticipated growth in Q4 combined with the lower inflation reading for March-April reflect different sets of factors influencing growth and inflation.",
        "The global macroeconomic conditions have continued to be adverse, reflecting slow growth momentum and moderating but elevated inflation pressures across economies.",
        "In addition, global trading opportunities have been limited by policies restricting supply chains.",
        "The recent events have also pointed to the vulnerability of the banking and financial sectors to monetary and fiscal policy stances.",
        "The energy markets experienced uncertainty in the face of global economic slowdown and the protracted Ukraine war.",
        "The monetary policy measures aimed at curbing inflationary pressures in the major advanced and emerging market economies appear to be successful in moderating inflation rate, although the rates remain well above the policy targets.",
        "This provides an overall context for an assessment of the likely course of growth and inflation in the short to medium term.",
        "One important feature of GDP growth in 202223 and also 2021-22 was the dominance of Q1 compared to the other quarters.",
        "As the pandemic induced sharp decline in GDP in Q1 of 2020-21 is offset by the subsequent growth, growth in Q1:2023-24 is likely to be closer to the growth across quarters.",
        "A second feature of growth performance in 2022-23 is the uneven performance across sectors.",
        "Manufacturing growth reflected in the growth of Gross Value Added (GVA) is placed at 1.3 per cent compared to the growth in construction (10.0 per cent) or the services sector (9.5 per cent).",
        "While the input cost pressures in 2022-23 appear to have had greater impact in the case of manufacturing than in the other sectors, slower growth of consumption spending and investment would also have affected demand for manufacturing more than the others.",
        "Finally, the deceleration in export demand would affect manufacturing output.",
        "Going forward, reduction in cost pressures and overall inflation, and revival of exports would be important in accelerating manufacturing growth.",
        "The indicators compiled by RBI for listed manufacturing companies in Q4: 2022-23 indicate significant improvement in profit margins with increased GVA growth and sustained improvement in capacity utilisation during the year are positive for the revival of manufacturing growth in 2023-24.",
        "However, there are segments within manufacturing sector where weak export environment would be a concern.",
        "The services sector was the growth driver for the economy in 2022-23.",
        "Revival of demand in the service sectors badly hit during the pandemic has sustained the growth of the overall sector.",
        "GVA growth in the sub-sector Trade, Hotels, Transportation and Broadcasting in 2022-23 is still only 4.1 per cent over its pre-pandemic level in 2019-20 with considerable upside potential of the sub-sector for growth.",
        "The export of services is expected to be adversely affected by the global economic slowdown in 2023-24.",
        "In the case of agriculture and allied sectors, GVA growth in 2022-23 turned out to be higher than 2021-22 although there were adverse weather effects during the year.",
        "The normal monsoon forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department, despite the emergence of the El Nino phenomenon, would be supportive of agricultural growth.",
        "and enterprises indicate improving consumer sentiments and business outlook for 202324.",
        "The improvement is, however, in comparison to a period of weak sentiments through 2022-23.",
        "Early results of the enterprise surveys indicate greater optimism on the part of services and infrastructure firms on demand conditions than in the case of manufacturing.",
        "The Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households conducted in May reflects steady increasing non-essential expenditure by the households.",
        "While cost pressures are is still widely shared especially in Q2.",
        "Higher selling prices are seen to improve profit margin.",
        "In the sectors where demand is buoyant, transmission of higher costs to selling prices would be greater.",
        "Overall, perceptions on cost pressures and selling prices vary across sectors.",
        "The high frequency indicators for the recent period of April-May provide a mixed picture.",
        "The urban and demand conditions show improvement, PMIs for manufacturing and services reflect rising output.",
        "However, there are also mixed signs of transport activity.",
        "Railway freight and port traffic, and motor spirit sale show YOY growth rates of less than five per cent but E-way bills and toll collections continue to register double digit growth.",
        "External trade has weakened in April.",
        "Non-food credit, a broader measure of economic activity, has increased by about 16 per cent during April-May 2023.",
        "The overall growth momentum for 2023-24 is expected to be more moderate than in 2022-23.",
        "The projections provided in the April meeting of the MPC hold over the improved official estimates for 2022-23.",
        "The GDP growth for 2023-24 is retained at 6.5 per cent YOY basis.",
        "The quarterly YOY growth projections are Q1: 8.0 per cent, Q2: 6.5 per cent, Q3: 6.0 per cent and Q4: 5.7 per cent, respectively.",
        "The significant downside risks to growth are the unfavourable rainfall conditions during the monsoon season, steeper than expected decline in global demand conditions and supply chain disruptions due to spillovers from the geo-political conflicts.",
        "As compared to the April forecast, the quarterly growth rates in Q1 and Q2 are revised upward and Q3 and Q4 downward in the forecast of 6.0 per cent for 2023-24, the same as in the previous round.",
        "The headline inflation rate, YOY, dropped further to below 5 per cent mark in April, following the decline to below 6 per cent in March.",
        "The rate of price rise fell in all three also seen in March.",
        "A number of factors have contributed to the significant decline in inflation rate in March and April: deceleration in the commodity prices in the international markets; decline in the inflation rates in the major economies, although they remain well above the targets; favourable base effects; and the impact of monetary and policy recent Inflation Expectations Survey of Urban Households finds that along with the perceived current inflation rates, the median expected inflation rate on a 3-months ahead and one-year ahead horizons is declining as compared to their levels in the previous round.",
        "Taking into account the current trends and assessment of factors influencing price with quarterly projections of 4.6 per cent in Q1, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.2 per cent in Q4.",
        "The projected inflation rate for FY 2023-24 is well below the rate of 6.7 per cent experienced in the previous year and close to the median forecast of 5.0 per 29.",
        "However, a few concerns remain on the question of sustainability of the trends seen in March and April headline inflation rate.",
        "Several sub-categories of consumption basket still register price rise of well-above 6 per cent.",
        "Price rise, YOY basis, in the case of cereals and products is in double digits, and in milk and products above 8 per cent in March and April.",
        "Clothing and footwear and Household goods and services also are at or above 6 per cent rate of price rise in March and April.",
        "Among the broad groupings of items in the consumption basket excluding (1) Food and beverages, (2) Pan, tobacco and intoxicants and (3) Fuel and light, items with YOY price rise of 6 per cent or more account for 45 per cent of the weight of this broad group.",
        "The month over month change is higher in assessing the sustainability of moderating trend in headline inflation rate to the target of 4 per cent.",
        "The decline in the overall headline inflation in the recent two months combined with the strong growth performance in Q4: FY 2022-23 suggest a trajectory of lower YOY inflation of 5 per cent and GDP growth of above 6 per cent in FY 2023-24.",
        "The projected inflation rate is below the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent but well above the target of 4 per cent.",
        "There are also upside risks to inflation both on account of the evolution of sectoral price trends and developments at the global level.",
        "The impact of increase in policy rate between May 2022 and April 2023 by 250 basis points and other economic policy measures have been crucial in anchoring price expectations.",
        "As transmission of the policy changes through the economy to reach the inflation target is subject to unpredictable developments, it is necessary to ensure that the policy framework is focused on achieving the inflation target while supporting growth.",
        "Accordingly, I vote: (a) to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and (b) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.",
        "Global uncertainty continues although its economic impact has been less severe than expected.",
        "Major advanced economy (AE) central banks have slowed their tightening.",
        "Inflation is softening although it continues to be above target.",
        "They have shifted to a more data-based approach and are more willing to wait for the lagged effects of past tightening.",
        "Inflation has not been high for as long as it was in the seventies so there is less reason to fear persistence without higher for longer policy rates.",
        "Labour markets remain tight, but this may partly reflect labour hoarding by employers following the post Covid-19 labour shortages so that tightness may be overestimated.",
        "AE fiscal tightening has less global spillovers compared to monetary tightening so more AE fiscal consolidation may reduce pressures on monetary policy.",
        "Indian growth outperformed market expectations but did fall from 9.1% in FY22 to 7.2% in FY23.",
        "Some turnaround in manufacturing and continued growth in fixed investment in Q4FY23 augurs well for the future, however.",
        "Construction also remains robust, but consumption and exports have areas of softness, pent up demand for services may moderate, and unemployment remains high.",
        "Inflation has moderated into the tolerance band but is not yet firmly on the path to target, particularly in view of monsoon related uncertainties.",
        "Even so, it is clear that core inflation is neither persistent nor broad-based.",
        "Core inflation fell from 6.2% in January to 5.1% in April this year.",
        "Softening is to be expected in the absence of true second round effects from excess demand or from tight labour markets.",
        "Inflation was higher for so long because of multiple supply shocks.",
        "sharply in Q4FY23, input costs have fallen, wage pressures are not there, and since demand is slack they are unlikely to raise prices.",
        "WPI inflation, that has a larger weight of manufacturing prices, is negative.",
        "The IIM Ahmedabad business expectation survey expectations.",
        "Preliminary results from the RBI enterprise surveys, however, show firms expecting price and cost inflation to rise, despite actual costs and inflation softening.",
        "This may be due to fears about the monsoon and bears watching over the next few months.",
        "The quick succession of repo rate raises has brought the real rate to near equilibrium levels, which has prevented over-heating as well as over-tightening of demand and helped to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "The slowdown and pause was also well-timed.",
        "It is necessary to build on the learning of the past few years where allowing sufficient nominal variation in repo and exchange rates to keep real rates near equilibrium has helped smooth shocks and sustain Indian growth resilience.",
        "The experience has shown that independence from AE monetary cycles is feasible and foreign inflows are not tightly linked to the interest rate differential with AE rates.",
        "Flexibility in inflation targeting, intervention in FX markets to reduce excess volatility, economic diversity, supply-side action and good monetary-fiscal coordination under supply shocks have all contributed to better outcomes.",
        "As expected inflation falls, however, it is important that real repo rate does not rise too high.",
        "This is what happened in 2015 as international oil prices fell, damaging the economic cycle.",
        "Research suggests that the inflation targeting regime has contributed to reducing inflation expectations.",
        "Commitment to such a regime only involves aligning the nominal repo rate with expected inflation.",
        "Such action, together with the greater impact of official communication in emerging markets, is adequate to bring inflation to target as the effect of shocks dies down.",
        "It does not require the nominal repo to be kept higher for longer.",
        "But in this meeting, it is appropriate for the MPC to pause.",
        "I also vote for the present stance to continue since at present it is not possible to give a signal about future action.",
        "The latter will be conditional on the data coming in.",
        "The pause is only for the current meeting.",
        "Moreover, transient events have created a liquidity surplus, so that withdrawal of liquidity itself is also required.",
        "The outlook on inflation and growth has changed only marginally between the April meeting and this meeting.",
        "The two inflationary risks that I spoke about in April (crude prices and the monsoon) have become a little less worrisome.",
        "On the crude oil front, it is now clear that OPEC+ is struggling to reduce supply adequately to counter sluggish demand, and the risk of a substantial spike in crude price in the near term is not very high.",
        "As regards the monsoon, the official forecast of a normal monsoon provides some comfort, but it is tempered by the fact that the forecast includes an almost even chance of monsoon being below normal or worse.",
        "Fortunately, the forecast likelihood of a deficient monsoon is only marginally higher than the climatological probability, and the chance of a drought appears to be rather remote.",
        "This augurs well because the Indian economy is quite resilient to a monsoon which is somewhat below normal if its spatial and temporal distribution is satisfactory.",
        "Another indication of a slight reduction in inflationary risks is the slight decline in the RBI projections of inflation for 2023-24 between the April and June meetings.",
        "Similarly, the outlook for growth remains more or less the same as in April with several high frequency indicators suggesting that growth is not as robust as we would like.",
        "Considering the balance of risks, I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting.",
        "I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to keep inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band.",
        "However, there are significant risks to both inflation and growth, and the process of bringing inflation under control is still very much work in progress.",
        "It would be premature to declare victory at this point of time based on the inflation prints of MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary 42.",
        "Turning to the stance, I find that with every successive meeting, this stance is becoming more and more disconnected from reality.",
        "Based on the forecast inflation for well be above that level since in recent weeks, many money market rates have often drifted towards the MSF rate of 6.75%).",
        "In other words, monetary policy is now dangerously close to levels at which it can inflict significant damage to the economy.",
        "Despite this, the majority of the MPC wishes to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation whatever that phrase might mean.",
        "I have therefore seriously considered dissenting on this part of the resolution, but after careful thought I have decided to confine myself to expressing reservations on it.",
        "The main reason for not dissenting is that, after two successive meetings at which the repo rate has been left unchanged, this stance now appears more vestigial than a serious statement of intent.",
        "The reasons outlined for a pause in rate action in my previous statement of April 2023 broadly hold for this meeting as well.",
        "Moreover, as the latest prints of growth and inflation indicate a Goldilocks scenario, with growth higher and inflation marginally lower than anticipated, this is telling us that our cumulative actions taken so far are working in the right direction.",
        "It needs to be acknowledged, however, that knowing when to stop is hard.",
        "The effects of tight policy will continue to percolate through the system months after the pause.",
        "If policy makers continue tightening until inflation falls as much as they want, they are likely to go farther than they need to (Romer and Romer, 2023)[1].",
        "Notwithstanding this, it is important that we do not drop our guard against inflation, especially when we are still away from our primary goal of aligning inflation to the 4.0 per cent target.",
        "On the domestic growth front, the optimism spelt out in my earlier minutes has materialised, with the acceleration in real GDP growth for Q4:2022-23 to 6.1 per cent from 4.5 per cent in the preceding quarter.",
        "The quarter-on-quarter (qoq) seasonally adjusted momentum in Q4 at 2.9 per cent, well above the pre-pandemic average of 1.7 per cent (2012-13 to 2019-20), bodes well for growth going forward.",
        "Furthermore, there are clear signs of economic activity holding up well in Q1:2023-24[2] as indicated by various high frequency indicators and this optimism is expected to follow through in the remaining quarters of 2023-24.",
        "This stems from three factors: (i) revival in rural consumption; (ii) private corporate investment gaining steam; and (iii) moderating drag from net external demand.",
        "Rural demand is supported by the robust agriculture in aggregate GVA (around 15 per cent in 2022-23) and its contribution to GDP growth, even if monsoon turns out be lower than normal, its impact on growth may not be significant.",
        "On the other hand, deficient monsoon could have a more tangible impact on inflation due to the higher share of food items in the CPI consumption basket.",
        "There is an increasing revival in corporate investment due to slackening of input cost pressures and rising capacity utilisation.",
        "Credit growth to industry has improved driven by large industries, particularly, roads, steel, cement, construction, petroleum and chemicals.",
        "On the supply side, manufacturing sector performance, which turned positive in Q4:2022-23, is likely to improve further with softening commodity prices, normalisation of supply chains and production linked incentive (PLI) scheme gaining traction.",
        "Manufacturing companies in several key sectors have expanded their fixed assets.",
        "Services sector constituted about 63 per cent share in aggregate gross value added (GVA) and contributed around 83 per cent to growth in GVA during 2022-23 and is expected to remain the mainstay of growth in 2023-24.",
        "Higher contraction in merchandise imports coupled with buoyant services exports are improving net external demand.",
        "Headline CPI inflation fell sharply by 1.7 percentage points between February and April 2023, supported by favourable base effects and soft price momentum.",
        "The softening in core inflation was seen across various exclusion based as well as trimmed 2 Real GDP in Q1:2023-24 will also benefit from base effect which is yet to normalise.",
        "3 Around 55 per cent of rabi production is accounted for in Q1:2023-24. mean measures.",
        "CPI diffusion indices indicate that a majority of the CPI items saw price increases less than a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of 6 per cent during March-April 2023, a significant reversal from February.",
        "All these suggest some waning of price pressures in CPI in recent months, as the impact of monetary policy actions, supply side measures and easing of global commodity prices played through.",
        "Inflation, however, is likely to remain well above the target rate of 4 per cent throughout the year.",
        "We have been prudent in our approach using the flexibility imbedded in the framework to operate within the tolerance band in balancing macroeconomic priorities depending upon the need of the hour.",
        "With greater clarity on macro fronts, prudence requires that we now focus on aligning inflation to the target of 4 per cent.",
        "Time is opportune to emphasise the distinction between the inflation _target and_ _tolerance of_ deviations from the target.",
        "The tolerance band can be conceptually broken down into an uncertainty range[4] owing to imperfect knowledge of the (present and future) state of the economy; the indifference range over which monetary policy is not expected to react; and finally, the operational range that allows for intentional deviations to exercise short-run trade-offs between inflation and growth (Chung et al, 2020).",
        "[5] Sustained deviations of inflation from the target may lead to a steady drift of inflation expectations.",
        "The risk of ceding part of the operational range to the indifference range makes it imperative to emphasise the primacy of the 4 per cent inflation target.",
        "This is crucial to support the ongoing process of anchoring inflation expectations around the target.",
        "Moreover, real policy rate continues to be positive which will further anchor inflation expectations.",
        "The rate pause in April seems to have had a sobering impact on domestic financial conditions.",
        "For instance, the average spread of the 10-year G-sec yield over the 1-year G-sec, 91-day Treasury bills, and the policy repo rate moderated to 20 bps, 29 bps and average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans and the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh deposits of scheduled commercial banks fell by 23 bps and 12 bps, respectively, in April 2023.",
        "Such an easing of financial conditions occurred, even as the MPC had unequivocally argued that the pause was specific to the April policy and not a policy pivot.",
        "Accordingly, continuity in the stance with a clear-cut objective of aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target is important.",
        "Any premature change in stance may be hasty and could undo the hard work done so far.",
        "It may also tamper with the transmission process that is currently underway.",
        "Recent actions of some advanced economies reverting back to rate hikes after a pause need to be kept in mind.",
        "Thus, I vote for a pause in rate action and continuity of stance.",
        "Monetary policy actions would need to be calibrated carefully by assessing the impact of past actions, meticulously scrutinising the incoming data, and responding appropriately to the evolving macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Macroeconomic outcomes have broadly evolved along projected paths, vindicating the April 2023 monetary policy decision and stance.",
        "This provides elbow room to reassess the evolving outlook with information gleaned from current rounds of forwardlooking surveys and updated forecasts of goal variables, while keeping in mind the economy.",

        "The near-term outlook for inflation is also relatively benign _vis-a-vis the 2022-23_ experience.",
        "Beyond the first quarter, however, pressure points emanating from specific supply-demand mismatches could impart upward pressure to the momentum of prices and offset favourable base effects, especially in the second half of 2023-24.",
        "Hence, shocks dissipate without leaving scars on the economy.",
        "Accordingly, my vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate should be seen as taking middle stump guard to prepare for a bouncier pitch.",
        "Holding the rate unchanged should not be interpreted as the interest rate cycle having peaked, but as a period of careful evaluation of a decision on the extent of additional policy tightening, if needed.",
        "This is a part of continuous learning about the underlying structure of the economy with new information until the next meeting of the MPC, and not a prolonged pause.",
        "Headline inflation is edging down towards the target, but it is still well above it and the balance of risks suggests that it will go up in coming months before it comes down.",
        "Therefore, continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation is appropriate as it adequately conveys the future course of interest rates in the economy.",

        "The inflation trajectory has seen significant softening during March-April 2023, as anticipated, with the near-term outlook turning out to be more favourable than envisaged earlier.",
        "Inflation is now projected to average 5.1 per cent in 2023-24 compared to 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, but this would still be above the target.",

        "International prices for key food items like rice and sugar are at elevated levels.",
        "Adverse climate events have the potential to quickly change the direction of the inflation trajectory.",
        "Geo-political tensions, uncertainty on crude price trajectory and volatile financial markets pose further upside risks to prices.",
        "These considerations warrant close monitoring of the evolving price dynamics.",
        "The pause in April MPC was based on the need to assess the cumulative impact of 250 bps rate hike over the past one year.",
        "Our surveys indicate that anchoring of expectations is underway and our monetary policy actions are yielding the desired results.",
        "Given the baseline inflation projections for 2023-24, positive real policy rates will aid the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "The full impact of past actions is still unfolding.",
        "In this situation, a pause in the rate hike cycle and closely assessing the evolving situation looks the most appropriate option for this meeting of the MPC.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC.",
        "Our job is only half done, having brought inflation within the target band.",
        "Our fight against inflation is not yet over.",
        "We need to undertake forward-looking assessment of the evolving inflation-growth outlook and stand ready to act, if situation so warrants.",
        "Beyond this and given the prevailing uncertainties, it is difficult to give any definitive forward guidance about our future course of action in a rate tightening cycle.",
        "I also vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation, given that liquidity in the banking system is still in surplus and we have a way to go to align headline inflation with 4.0 per cent target on a durable basis and ensure that the overall financial conditions are in sync with the monetary policy stance.",
        "We will continue to remain agile and flexible in managing liquidity through two-way operations.",
        "We do recognise that durable price and financial stability are mutually reinforcing and necessitate greater policy focus at the current juncture.",

        "First, the official end of season report on the Monsoon confirmed that the rainfall was only 94% of the Long Period Average.",
        "This small shortfall coupled with the spatiotemporal dispersion in the rainfall could cause some volatility in food prices.",

        "Therefore, I think that the impact of OPEC+ geopolitics would be limited to slowing the pace of decline in inflation, and is unlikely to cause a reversal of this trajectory.",
        "Turning to growth, the outlook has improved modestly because of increasing consumer confidence as indicated in the RBI surveys.",
        "This increased confidence must also be seen in the light of household financial savings data released by the RBI in September.",
        "The data shows that consumers have incurred financial liabilities and reduced net financial savings to support consumption.",
        "This willingness to consume at the cost of reducing savings is very important because it is household consumption that has been propping up the economy in the face of headwinds from fiscal consolidation, weak external demand and tepid capital investment.",
        "It is possible that this consumer confidence could become a self fulfilling prophecy as robust consumption demand stimulates growth, generates income and strengthens household balance sheets.",

        "I would much prefer a stance in which words are consistent with the actions.",
        "Moreover, at this point of time, the guidance that the market really needs is not about how high the terminal repo rate would be, but about how long the rate would be maintained at a high level.",
        "It would therefore be useful for the MPC to communicate its intention to keep real interest rates high enough for as long as is necessary to drive projected inflation close to the 4% target on a sustainable basis.",
        "At this juncture, three global trends, among many others, need to be closely front, the containment of food price pressures, particularly vegetable prices, which is reversing, is an important assumption behind retaining our inflation projection at 5.4 per cent during 2023-24.",

        "Sustained deflation in WPI non-food manufactured product inflation is also a comforting factor for core inflation.",
        "Moreover, moderation of services inflation to close to 4 per cent continues to be a relief as they tend to be stickier as seen in advanced economies.",
        "There was also further progress on anchoring of household inflation expectations with 3-month ahead and 1-year ahead inflation expectations having seen a cumulative decline of 170 bps and 110 bps respectively since September 2022.",
        "Important point to note is that the sharp jump in vegetable prices have not deterred anchoring of inflation expectations with relatively less impact of food inflation on persistence of core inflation.",

        "Services sector growth continues to remain robust.",
        "Broad-basing of economic activity is also reflected in the data on household savings.",
        "Though net financial savings of households moderated to 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2022-23, mainly due to significant rise in financial liabilities of households both from bank and non-bank sources (5.8 per cent of GDP from 3.8 per cent in 2021-22), the gross financial savings increased in absolute terms by 13.9 per cent in 2022-23 over the previous year.",
        "Moreover, household borrowings reflect higher spending on real estate, vehicles, consumer goods, among others.",
        "This implies that the overall savings of households is expected to hold steady with compositional shift in favour of physical savings.",
        "[5] This would be growth supportive either through direct addition to gross capital formation or by assisting upturn in private capex.",
        "Higher investment and income would reinforce higher savings as we have seen in Q4:2022-23 when the net household financial savings normalised to its long-term average of 7.0 per cent from a low range of 4.0 to 4.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 2022-23.",
        "The concerns regarding statistical discrepancy on the expenditure side estimates at 2.8 per cent of GDP for Q1:2023-24 (-3.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2022-23) are unfounded.",
        "This discrepancy varies from negative to positive ranging from -4.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent in the new GDP series during Q1:2011-12 to Q1:2023-24 and it eventually evens out.",
        "In the pre-pandemic period (Q1:2011-12 to Q3:2019-20), on an average, the share of discrepancy in GDP was 0.9 per cent, while in the post pandemic period (Q4:2019-20 to Q1:2023-24), it has averaged -0.4 per cent.",
        "As per the global practice, the production approach of compiling national accounts statistics (NAS) is considered to be firmer and the NAS presents discrepancy with the expenditure approach of GDP compilation explicitly in its regular releases (Sources and Methods, NSO, 2012), adhering to the recommendations by the system of national accounts (SNA 2008).",
        "Nevertheless, there is a need to improve GDP estimates from the expenditure side so that evolving dynamics of demand side components are captured appropriately.",
        "Given that inflation expectations are backward looking in emerging markets including India, occurrences of multiple large adverse supply shocks run the risk of a drift in inflation expectations from underlying trend, which could eventually stall the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "Such supply shocks are challenging and test the inflation fighting credibility of central banks.",
        "Though transitory relative price changes in the economy that may spur temporary bouts of inflation may be looked through, monetary policy also 5 Physical savings data will be released by NSO in end-February 2024. needs to be watchful to see that large and frequent supply side shocks does not trigger generalised increase in prices.",
        "[6] Past such instances in India, as in 2020, do give objective to anchoring inflation expectations, rather than inflation per se.",
        "Besides, the sustained fall in core inflation as mentioned earlier vouches for its transitory nature going ahead.",
        "Overall, with growth and inflation broadly moving in anticipated direction, monetary policy needs to hold on while earnestly persevering with disinflationary approach and remaining watchful with readiness to act if the situation demands.",
        "This calls for continuation of withdrawal of accommodation stance for monetary policy so as to facilitate further transmission of the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy.",

        "There is also discretionary spending in view of high inflation and this is slowing sales growth of corporations.",
        "As the economy negotiates the rapids of the second and third quarters of 2023 24, the trajectory of inflation is being buffeted by price shocks related to perishables.",
        "Surprisingly, they are producing inordinately high and painful spikes in the headline that are unacceptable from the point of view of the overall welfare of our societies.",
        "When headline inflation faces price pressures from perishables like vegetables, the standard operating procedure of monetary policy is to look through the transitory impact of their first round effects and await mean reversion.",

        "In normal conditions, it was the more persistent core that affected volatile food inflation[3.]",
        "Spikes in food prices can therefore be looked through as long as they remain just that.",

        "I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to bring inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band.",
        "Turning to the stance, my reservations remain the same as in the past.",
        "However, this would be the third successive meeting at which the repo rate has been left unchanged (assuming that the MPC decides to pause now).",
        "This disconnect between stance and action has completely hollowed out whatever meaning the stance might have originally had, and turned it into a harmless ritualism.",
        "So I am content with expressing reservations about the stance.",

        "Since mid-June to end-July 2023 tomato prices have surged by 362 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of the price escalation happening during endJune and first half of July.",
        "The magnitude and intensity of the price shock this time around was substantially higher when compared to earlier years.",
        "[4] Our historical experience, however, suggests that the inflationary shocks emanating from commodities like vegetables are in fact transitory in nature.",
        "In 2017, when tomato prices soared by 27 per cent in the month of June and further by 138 per cent in July, this was followed by a sharp correction over the subsequent two months.",

        "Although the catch up in _kharif sowing augurs well for agricultural_ production, price increases observed across other vegetables as well as other food subgroups such as cereals, pulses and spices remain a point of concern, demanding our vigilant monitoring.",

        "Against this backdrop, recent inflation developments and outlook warrant careful assessment and strategy.",
        "Through the current episode, inflation has declined from an average of 7.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2022-23 (peak at 7.8 per cent in April 2022) to 4.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2023-24 (4.8 per cent in June 2023), i.e., by 270 basis points.",
        "Monetary policy tightening by a cumulative increase of 250 basis points in the policy rate contributed 130 basis points of disinflation, while the waning of supply shocks contributed 140 basis points and other factors offset each other.",

        "Services activity remained strong in Q1:2023-24 and it is likely to follow through during the remaining period of 2023-24.",
        "Rural consumption has shown signs of improvement in Q1:2023-24 while urban consumption has remained stable.",
        "Investment activity is supported by strong government and the twin-balance sheet advantage of banks and corporates provide a congenial environment for private sector investments to gather pace.",
        "Private investments are already happening in a few critical sectors like iron and steel, automobiles, petroleum, metals and chemicals.",

        "The impact of the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy is still playing out.",
        "Considering all these aspects, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent with preparedness to act, should the situation so warrant.",
        "Further, as transmission of the repo rate increase of 250 bps to lending and deposit rates is still incomplete, I vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "In this dynamic environment, we remain steadfastly committed to our goal of aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 per cent.",

        "The MPC also around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",

        "highest reading in more than six years.",
        "The Japanese economy continued on a path of healthy expansion despite a downward revision in growth since March 2017 on weaker than expected capital expenditure.",
        "Among the major emerging market economies (EMEs), strong growth in Q2 in China was powered by retail sales, and imports grew at a rapid pace, suggesting robust domestic demand; investment activity, however, slowed down.",
        "The Brazilian economy expanded for two consecutive quarters in Q2 on improving terms of trade, even as the impact of recession persists on the labour market.",
        "Economic activity in Russia recovered further, supported by strengthening global demand, firming up of oil prices and accommodative monetary policy.",
        "Although South Africa has emerged out of recession in Q2, the economy faces economic and political challenges.",
        "The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) indicates a significant improvement in global trade in 2017 over the lacklustre growth in 2016, backed by a resurgence of Asian trade flows and rising imports by North America.",
        "Crude oil prices hit a two-year high in September on account of the combined effect of a pick-up in demand, tightening supplies due to production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and declining crude oil inventories in the US.",
        "Metal prices have eased since mid-September on weaker high in early September on account of safe-haven demand due to geo-political tensions, before weakening somewhat in the second half.",
        "Weak non-oil commodity prices and low wage growth kept inflation pressures low in most AEs and subdued in several EMEs, largely reflecting country-specific factors.",
        "Global financial markets have been driven mainly by the changing course of monetary policy in AEs, generally improving economic prospects and oscillating geopolitical factors.",
        "Equity markets in most AEs have continued to rise.",
        "In EMEs, equities generally gained on improved global risk appetite, supported by upbeat economic data and expectations of a slower pace of monetary tightening in major AEs.",
        "While bond yields in major AEs moved sideways, they showed wider variation in EMEs.",
        "In currency markets, the US dollar weakened further and fell to a multi-month low in September on weak inflation, though it recovered some lost ground in the last week of September on a hawkish US Fed stance and tensions around North Korea.",

        "On the domestic front, real gross value added (GVA) growth slowed significantly in Q1 of 2017-18, cushioned partly by the extensive front-loading of expenditure by the central government.",
        "GVA growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened quarter-on-quarter in the usual first quarter moderation, partly reflecting deceleration in the growth of livestock products, forestry and fisheries.",
        "Industrial sector GVA growth fell sequentially as well as on a y-o-y basis.",
        "The manufacturing lowest in the last 20 quarters.",
        "The mining sector, which showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2016-17, entered into contraction mode again in Q1 of 2017-18, on account of a decline in coal production and subdued crude oil production.",
        "Services sector performance, however, improved markedly, supported mainly by trade, hotels, transport and communication, which bounced back after a persistent slowdown throughout 2016-17.",
        "Construction picked up pace after contracting in Q4 of 2016-17.",

        "The live storage in reservoirs fell to 66 per cent of the full capacity as compared with 74 per cent a year ago.",
        "The uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon was reflected in the first advance estimates of _kharif production by the Ministry of Agriculture, which were below the_ level of the previous year due to lower area sown under major crops including rice, coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, jute and mesta.",
        "The index of industrial production (IIP) recovered marginally in July 2017 from the contraction in June on the back of a recovery in mining, quarrying and electricity generation.",
        "However, manufacturing remained weak.",
        "In terms of the use-based classification, contraction in capital goods, intermediate goods and consumer durables pulled down overall IIP growth.",

        "The manufacturing PMI moved into expansion zone in August and September 2017 on the strength of new orders.",
        "On the services side, the picture remained mixed.",
        "Many indicators pointed to improved performance even as the services PMI continued in the contraction zone in August due to low new orders.",
        "In the construction segment, steel consumption was robust.",
        "In the transportation sector, sales of commercial and passenger vehicles as well as two and three-wheelers, railway freight traffic and international air passenger traffic showed significant upticks.",
        "However, cement production, cargo handled at major ports, domestic air freight and passenger traffic showed weak performance.",
        "Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) edged up sequentially in July and August to reach a five month high, due entirely to a sharp pick up in momentum as the favourable base effect tapered off in July and disappeared in August.",
        "After a decline in prices in June, food inflation rebounded in the following two months, driven mainly by a sharp rise in vegetable prices, along with the rise in inflation in prepared meals and fruits.",
        "Cereals inflation remained benign, while deflation in pulses continued for the ninth successive month.",
        "Fuel group inflation remained broadly unchanged in August even as inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, firewood and chips rose.",
        "Petroleum product prices tracked the hardening of international crude oil prices.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel also increased sharply in July and further in August, reversing from its trough in June 2017.",
        "The increase was broad-based in both goods and services.",
        "Housing inflation hardened further in August on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7[th] central pay commission award.",
        "Inflation in household goods and services in health, recreation and clothing & footwear sub-groups increased.",
        "Quantitative inflation expectations of households eased in the September 2017 round of the Reserve respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose markedly for the three-month as well as one-year ahead horizons.",
        "Farm and industry input costs picked up in August.",
        "Real wages in the rural and organised that corporate pricing power for the manufacturing sector remained weak.",
        "In contrast, firms polled for the services sector PMI reported a sharp rise in prices charged.",
        "Surplus liquidity in the system persisted through Q2 even as the build-up in government cash balances since mid-September 2017 due to advance tax outflows reduced the size of the surplus liquidity significantly in the second half of the month.",
        "Currency in circulation increased at a moderate pace during Q2, by ` 569 billion as against ` 1,964 billion during Q1, reflecting the usual seasonality.",
        "Consistent with the guidance given in April 2017 on liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted open market sales operations on six occasions during Q2 to absorb ` 600 billion of surplus liquidity on a durable basis, in addition to the issuances of treasury bills (of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) during April and May of ` 1 trillion.",
        "As a result, net average absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from ` 3 trillion in July to ` 1.6 trillion in the second half of September.",
        "The weighted average call rate (WACR), which on an average, traded below the repo rate by 18 basis points (bps) during July, firmed up by 5 bps in September on account of higher demand for liquidity around mid-September in response to advance tax outflows.",
        "Reflecting improving global demand, merchandise export growth picked up in August 2017 after decelerating in the preceding three months.",
        "Engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals were the major contributors to export growth in August 2017; growth in exports of readymade garments and drugs & continued to be lower than that of other emerging economies such as Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam, some of which have benefited from the global commodity price rebound.",
        "Import growth remained in double-digits for the eighth successive month in August and was fairly broad-based.",
        "While the surge in imports of crude oil and coal largely reflected a rise in international prices, imports of machinery, machine tools, iron and steel also picked up.",
        "Gold import volume has declined sequentially since June 2017, though the level in August was more than twice that of a year ago.",
        "The sharper increase in imports relative to exports resulted in a widening of the current account deficit in Q1 of 2017-18, even as net services exports and remittances picked up.",
        "Net foreign direct investment at US$ 10.6 billion in April-July 2017 was 24 per cent higher than during the same period of last year.",
        "While the debt segment of the domestic capital market attracted foreign portfolio investment of US$ 14.4 billion, there were significant outflows in the equity segment in August-September on account of geo-political uncertainties and expected cent in the second half of 2017-18.",
        "Actual inflation outcomes so far have been broadly in line with projections, though the extent of the rise in inflation excluding food and fuel has been somewhat higher than expected.",
        "The inflation path for the rest of 2017-18 is expected to be shaped by several factors.",
        "First, the assessment of food prices going forward is largely favourable, though the first advance estimates of kharif production pose some uncertainty.",
        "Early indicators show that prices of pulses which had declined significantly to undershoot trend levels in recent months, have now begun to stabilise.",
        "Second, some price revisions pending the goods and services tax (GST) implementation have been taking place.",
        "Third, there has been a broad-based increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Finally, international crude prices, which had started rising from early July, have firmed up further in September.",
        "Taking into account these factors, inflation is expected to rise from its current level and range allowance by the Centre (Chart 1).",
        "As noted in the August policy, there are factors that continue to impart upside risks to this baseline inflation trajectory: (a) implementation of farm loan waivers by States may result in possible fiscal slippages and undermine the quality of public salary and allowances award is not yet considered in the baseline projection; an increase by States similar to that by the Centre could push up headline inflation by could have potential second round effects.",
        "However, adequate food stocks and effective supply management by the Government may keep food inflation more benign than assumed in the baseline.",
        "Turning to growth projections, the loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 and the first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains production are early setbacks that impart a downside to the outlook.",
        "The implementation of the GST so far also appears to have had an adverse impact, rendering prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short term.",
        "This may further delay the revival of investment activity, which is already hampered by stressed balance sheets of banks and corporates.",
        "Consumer confidence and overall business assessment of the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Reserve Bank weakened in Q2 of 2017-18; on the positive side, firms expect a significant improvement in business sentiment in Q3.",
        "Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has been revised down to 6.7 per cent from the August 2017 projection of 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",
        "Imparting an upside to this baseline, household consumption demand may get a boost from upward salary and allowances revisions by states.",
        "Teething problems linked to the GST and bandwidth constraints may get resolved relatively soon, allowing growth to accelerate in H2.",
        "On the downside, a faster than expected rise in input costs and lack of pricing power may put further pressure on corporate margins, affecting value added by industry.",
        "Moreover, consumer confidence of households employment, income, prices faced and spending incurred.",
        "The MPC observed that CPI inflation has risen by around two percentage points since its last meeting.",
        "These price pressures have coincided with an escalation of global geo-political uncertainty and heightened volatility in financial normalisation by the European Central Bank.",
        "Such juxtaposition of risks to inflation needs to be carefully managed.",
        "Although the domestic food price outlook remains largely stable, generalised momentum is building in prices of items excluding food, especially emanating from crude oil.",
        "The possibility of fiscal slippages may add to this momentum in the future.",
        "The MPC also acknowledged the likelihood of the output gap widening, but requires more data to better ascertain the transient versus sustained headwinds in the recent growth prints.",
        "Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.",
        "The MPC also decided to keep the policy stance neutral and monitor incoming data closely.",
        "The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis.",
        "The MPC was of the view that various structural reforms introduced in the recent period will likely be growth augmenting over the medium- to long-term by improving the business environment, enhancing transparency and increasing formalisation of the economy.",
        "The Reserve Bank continues to work towards the resolution of stressed corporate exposures in bank balance sheets which should start yielding dividends for the economy over the medium term.",
        "The MPC reiterated that it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity which, in turn, would revive the demand for bank credit by industry as existing capacities get utilised and the requirements of new capacity open up to be financed.",
        "Recapitalising public sector banks adequately will ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors are not impeded and growth impulses not restrained.",
        "In addition, the following measures could be undertaken to support growth and achieve a faster closure of the output gap: a concerted drive to close the severe infrastructure gap; restarting stalled investment projects, particularly in the public sector; enhancing ease of doing business, including by further simplification of the GST; and ensuring faster rollout of the affordable housing program with time-bound single-window clearances and rationalisation of excessively high stamp duties by states.",
        "Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr.",
        "Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted for a policy rate reduction of at least 25 basis points.",
        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 5 and 6, 2017.",
        "In the August review, I was concerned that the downward movement in both CPI headline inflation and inflation excluding food and fuel may not sustain into the durable future.",
        "With a roughly 200 basis points increase in headline inflation in the last two months, and with the acceleration of inflation excluding food and fuel to 4.6 per cent from 4.1 per cent, upside risks to the medium term inflation target of 4 per cent have again come to the fore.",
        "This suggests that the big dip in inflation excluding food and fuel starting in March has turned out to be temporary.",
        "The rebound in headline inflation has largely been due to spikes in vegetable inflation that has made the CPI vegetable index come back to its earlier peak.",
        "I am also concerned about adverse demand-supply dynamics in crude prices which had led to a 22 per cent increase in crude prices since June 2017.",
        "A relaxation of endyear fiscal deficit targets if tax revenues take a hit due to GST-related disruptions also poses an upside risk to the medium term inflation target.",
        "On the other hand, I view the recent round of inflationary expectations data as positive, with the decline in the 3-month inflationary expectations being about 230 basis points since September 2016.",
        "While there has been a secular decline in economic growth for the past 6 quarters, it is likely that the Q1:2017-18 GVA growth print of 5.6 per cent was possibly a trough, and that a revival in economic activity is possibly in the works.",
        "The economy has been subject to numerous policy shocks in the form of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), GST, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), loan waivers, and demonetisation, all of which have undoubtedly lead to some churning, but which will also move the economy to a reformed steady state.",
        "What makes me optimistic are the following factors: (i) both the August and September PMI in manufacturing have been in an expansion mode.",
        "(ii) An economic revival of the Eurozone will push up exports.",
        "(iii) Real wage growth of the magnitude Having said this, I continue to worry about the slowing rate of capital accumulation and its impact on lowering potential growth and total factor productivity (TFP), but would like to see the next GDP growth print to have a better sense of whether the current decline in growth is transient, or part of a secular trend.",
        "In some joint research done by myself and some co-authors, on a calibrated/estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the Indian economy, the variance decomposition from the baseline model shows that about half of the fluctuations (variance) in output in the Indian economy in the last five years are explained by TFP shocks, and one-third is explained by fiscal shocks.",
        "Monetary policy shocks only explain around 12 per cent of output variations.",
        "This highlights not only the weakness of monetary policy transmission in the Indian economy, but the need for continual structural reforms and rule bound fiscal policy which will stabilize the Indian business cycle.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a pause in the policy repo 32.",
        "On the inflation front, retail inflation recorded a five-month high in August, 2017.",
        "This was driven partly by the dissipation of the favourable base effect and a rebound in food inflation, due to an increase in vegetable prices.",
        "CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, rose sharply as a result of hardening of prices in several categories.",
        "Housing inflation increased on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7[th] central pay commission award.",
        "Other sub-groups witnessing an increase included household goods and services, clothing, footwear, and miscellaneous items.",
        "Brent crude oil prices also surged in September, while the rupee weakened.",
        "Other upside risks to inflation include the impact of an expected decline in the production of foodgrains due to lower sowing during the _kharif season; the_ uncertainty in the short-term with respect to the effect of GST; the effects of a possible central government stimulus; the likely fiscal slippages due to the farm loan waivers; and the introduction of the pay commission award by states.",
        "Further, a potential increase in financial market volatility due to global developments, including the unwinding of the balance sheet by the Fed and the possibility of normalisation by the ECB, are also major concerns.",
        "These risks to inflation are reinforced by the responses to forward-looking surveys of consumers.",
        "Specifically, the qualitative responses to the September 2017 that the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose over the three-month as well as the one-year horizons.",
        "The September round of the Consumer Confidence Survey also signals the expectation of an increase in the price level in the next one year.",
        "Moreover, an uptick in the Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated), indicates a firming in underlying inflationary pressures.",
        "On the output front, GDP growth slowed down significantly in the first quarter of 2017-18, reflecting slower agricultural and manufacturing growth, along with tepid consumption and investment demand.",
        "Growth in services sector, however, picked up with an uptick in trade, hotels, transport and communication.",
        "The lacklustre growth is Survey, which shows a fall in the Current Situation Index as well as the Future Expectations Index, due to worsening sentiment on income and employment.",

        "This suggests an urgent need to revive investment activity and reinvigorate infrastructure-related projects, amongst other measures.",
        "anticipates the direction of growth in exports, is declining.",
        "It is also notable in this the global economy indicate waning global growth prospects.",
        "In the current scenario, a wait and watch strategy is recommended with continuous monitoring of data to distinguish between a temporary effect and a longlasting, structural impact.",
        "Thus, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "During the last two months of July and August, the increase in the headline inflation as well as inflation without food and fuel was more than expected.",
        "My forecasts had provided for some spikes in inflation during these months, but the actual increase exceeded the forecasts.",
        "While the oil prices strengthened in the international markets, they are not expected to increase further substantially.",
        "Although the monsoon ended with a marginal shortfall in the rainfall, its impact on the food prices is not expected to be very adverse since the replenished buffer stocks would take care of whatever shortages occur.",
        "The real cause of concern right now is the estimates of real GDP during Q1 of 2017-18 that showed a significantly more than expected slowdown of economic activity indicating widening of the negative output gap in the economy.",
        "Considering these additional developments, I strongly plead for at least a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy rate.",
        "Reasons for my vote are the following: survey have fallen over the last year sharply by 340 bps when the policy rate fell by only 50 bps.",
        "This implies a significant increase of 290 bps in the real interest rate for the households.",
        "ii) The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) Business Inflation Expectation Survey (BIES) shows that the businesses expect inflation one year ahead to be around 3.5 per cent in their costs.",
        "This inflation number is generally closely akin to the core inflation.",
        "iii) RBI survey has found that companies have started investing in financial assets rather than fixed assets.",
        "It indicates that the real interest cost on one hand and real interest rate on the other hand perceived by the companies are too high.",
        "This is supported by the decline in the new projects announced.",
        "iv) My inflation forecasts over six months and one year have only marginally changed upwards since I expect oil prices and exchange rates to be reasonably stable over medium term.",
        "Moreover, we had considered earlier changed substantially and is around 4.3 per cent without the impact of revisions in house rent allowance.",
        "As I had mentioned in the August MPC minutes, our forecast is lower.",
        "In this context, it is worth observing that the headline inflation without including housing index is currently only around 3 per cent.",
        "v) RBI surveys continue to show persistently low capacity utilization at around sector.",
        "This is also supported by RBI consumer confidence surveys showing worsening sentiments for income, employment and overall environment.",
        "RBI has also revised its GVA growth forecast downward in its October Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review for 2017-18 by 60 bps and for 2018-19 by 70 bps in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) compared to its April 2017 MPR.",
        "This by itself suggests that the negative output gap in the economy has widened at present and would continue widening in near future since output gap is calculated on levels and not rates of growth, which implies that the negative output gap would start narrowing only when the current growth rate exceeds the potential rate of growth.",
        "vi) There are some sceptics who argue that in India, where physical infrastructure like roads and railways are over-crowded, a negative output gap simply cannot exist.",
        "However, this argument is not valid since it is based on misconception of the potential output.",
        "Congestion and overcrowding of certain type of physical infrastructure that could be due to wrong pricing and other policies usually lead to very low productivity and indicate sub-optimal allocation of resources.",
        "This corroborates rather than negating the existence of a negative output gap, because the potential output is defined in terms of the optimal utilization of resources and not the actual utilization of resources.",
        "For instance, previously congested and hence inefficient roads have turned more efficient with introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST).",
        "The existing capital is better utilized and produces more output.",
        "Moreover, we need to recognize that many other physical infrastructures like some airports, seaports, irrigation dams, hospitals, institutions of higher learning and several industrial plants and machinery lie severely underutilized.",
        "Similarly a significant proportion of the labour force is underutilized.",
        "Therefore, negative output gap and its widening at present as argued earlier cannot be denied.",
        "vii) A rule-based monetary policy underlying the Flexible Inflation Targeting framework would necessitate a very well justified policy rate cut under the present circumstances.",
        "Real interest rate with expected future inflation rate in the economy currently is too high compared to most other countries.",
        "Now it has started seriously hurting consumers of durable goods and producers and hence production.",
        "We also need to recognize explicitly the cost of sacrificing output growth in terms of unemployment and poverty when inflation situation is practically under control in the near to medium term.",
        "In order to address the problems created by expanding negative output gap, we need to bring down the real interest rate in the economy.",
        "In my view, the policy rate should have been cut by 50 bps long back in June 2017.",
        "A cut of 25 bps in August was too small and too late.",
        "We can still make the additional cut of 25 bps now if we want to be extremely cautious.",
        "Otherwise, my opinion is that we have a space for a cut of about 40 bps at present with due consideration to any possible upward risk to future inflation.",
        "Recent inflation prints have vindicated my stance.",
        "They have also borne out the expectations of households and professional forecasters.",
        "All the factors I cited came into play in the inflation reading for August - the house rent allowance (HRA) for Central Government employees; the GST; the unfavourable reversal of base effects; and the seasonal spike in the prices of vegetables.",
        "Some of these factors will gain further traction over the months ahead.",
        "The firming up of pump prices of petrol and diesel, only partly due to rising international crude prices, has provided an additional upside to the inflation outlook in a froth-suffused financial environment.",
        "The recent reduction in excise duties on petroleum products is an acknowledgement of the social tolerance threshold for inflation from this source.",
        "By contrast, all the factors conditioning the August rate reduction have either not materialized or reversed - inflation excluding the HRA will likely exceed 4 per cent by the end of the year; inflation excluding food and fuel has turned up and will likely stay above 4 per cent in the months ahead; the rollout of the GST has not been smooth; and the monsoon is sub-normal in terms of its distribution during the crucial sowing weeks.",
        "With various alternative exclusion-based indicators of inflation above prices, exchange rate depreciation; inflation expectations.",
        "Professional forecasters qualitative expectations point to the rising probability of inflation rising faster than the current rate over the next three months.",
        "Current inflation developments and, in particular, deviations of outcomes from forecasts are shaping the future path of inflation in an ongoing error correction.",
        "The primary objective of monetary policy enjoined by the RBI Act is challenged and the credibility of the MPC will be tested in the months ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, growth outcomes have surprised on the downside.",
        "Parsing the data reveals that agricultural and allied activities are growing at broadly the same pace as in the first quarter of every year, while in the services sector, growth has accelerated.",
        "More recent indicators bear out these initial impulses.",
        "My sense is that the slowdown is troughing and activity will pick up in the second half of the year with better prospects for agriculture and services, and as the initial hitches associated with the GST get evened out.",
        "The slowdown is essentially located in manufacturing, and reinvigorating it holds the key.",
        "The question is: is the weakness in manufacturing, which persists in spite of a reduction of 200 basis points in the policy rate, within the narrow remit of monetary policy?",
        "The advocacy for a further reduction in the policy rate is essentially a case for lowering the cost of capital or the hurdle rate to a level at which a subdued or even declining internal rate of return (IRR) becomes viable.",
        "In my view, this is not a sustainable proposition and may even be self-fulfilling: chasing a deteriorating IRR will only lead to higher inflation and no investment.",
        "All indications point to a deeper malaise that chains down animal spirits in private enterprise and cries out for a bold structural transformation of the business policy response that will revive investment activity.",
        "A monetary policy reaction in the inflation target over a medium term horizon but the persuasive pull of the transient weakening of growth in the interregnum potentially undermines this commitment.",
        "I, therefore, vote for status quo, but only as long as inflation readings stay within the target of 4 per cent.",
        "It is time to be in readiness to raise the policy rate to quell the underlying drivers of inflation if they strengthen further.",
        "Over the past few years, household inflation expectations have been steadily getting anchored down as they are adapting to the realised inflation outcomes.",
        "However, these expectations still remain relatively high, and are likely also manifested in the continuing high level of rural and non-rural wage growth.",
        "Recent headline inflation prints have risen significantly from historic low in June and in a broad-based manner; in addition, oil-price risk and global market volatility have risen materially.",
        "In such a scenario, it is important in my view for the Reserve Bank to persist steadfastly with its objective (and mandate) of keeping medium-term inflation within a striking distance of the target of 4 per cent.",
        "Real-time activity indicators have been volatile over the last two quarters and do not yet paint a clear picture.",
        "Hence, it is too early, in my view, to be able to isolate the transient component of the recent one-quarter loss of momentum over and above the gradual decline in overall growth that has taken place since the Q1 of 2016-17.",
        "The gradual decline, which has turned our measures of output gap negative, is best explained by the deleveraging underway in the heavily indebted parts of the corporate sector and in poor credit growth of public sector banks given they have inadequate capital relative to impending losses on legacy assets.",
        "Corporate credit risk profile is showing some signs of improving gradually; the large distressed borrowers are being directed to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code; and efforts are under way to concretely address public sector bank health in near future.",
        "These structural changes will revive the affected economic activity, but with a lag.",
        "Teething problems, or at least the uncertainty, facing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, should also resolve soon.",
        "In the meantime, given our inflation outlook has risen quite some distance over the target of 4 per cent, there did not seem much room for monetary policy adjustment.",
        "The Reserve Bank remains committed to improving the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "I believe there is still some scope left for transmission of past monetary policy accommodation to existing loan portfolio that is tied to the base rate.",
        "Our Study Group on the MCLR has proposed what I find a reasonable path going forward in referencing floating rate loans to simple market benchmarks that will improve transparency for borrowers and competitiveness in lending.",
        "I am hopeful that switching to one of the recommended benchmarks with more frequent resets will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in future.",
        "Headline CPI inflation has risen sharply in the last two months and there has been a broad-based increase in inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Even as the assessment of food prices going forward is generally favourable, some factors have imparted uncertainty to the near-term overall inflation outlook.",
        "Firstly, international crude prices have firmed up significantly in the more recent period.",
        "Second, global geo-political uncertainty and volatility in financial markets have increased.",
        "Third, a combination of farm loan debt waivers by state governments and the implementation of the pay commission award could entail some fiscal slippages and pose a risk to inflation.",
        "Notwithstanding some softening in the recent period, inflation expectations show downward rigidity.",
        "This is reflected in the high increase in staff cost, particularly in the manufacturing sector.",
        "The loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 has imparted a downside to the overall GVA outlook.",
        "The implementation of the GST has rendered prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short-term This may further delay the acceleration in investment activity.",
        "However, there is a need for more data to assess whether the recent headwinds in overall GDP growth prints are transient or sustained.",
        "Prospects of agriculture are favourable, notwithstanding marginally lower overall business sentiment improving in Q3.",
        "The manufacturing PMI remained in expansion mode in August and September.",
        "Output of core industries showed a commercial and passenger vehicles, international air passenger traffic, railway freight projected to strengthen in the second half of the year.",
        "Recent structural reforms may have had some impact on growth in the short run.",
        "However, they will boost medium- to long-term growth prospects.",
        "To improve immediate growth prospects, teething troubles relating to GST need to be addressed expeditiously.",
        "Concerted efforts also need to be made to encourage investment activity by removing various constraints.",
        "Resolution of stressed balance sheets of banks remains important for supporting a revival in the investment cycle.",
        "Finally, government should adjust administered interest rates on savings instruments every quarter as per the formula to help with monetary transmission.",
        "For keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis, it is important to recognise near and medium-term risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "We have to be vigilant on account of uncertainties on the external and fiscal fronts; this calls for a cautious approach.",
        "I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold, while maintaining the stance as neutral.",
        "The sixth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on August 1 and 2, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.",

        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.25 per cent to 6.0 per cent with immediate effect.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.25 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",

        "Equity markets in most AEs have registered gains, with indices crossing previous highs in the US, but European markets were weighed down by Brexit talks and the strengthening euro.",
        "In EMEs, equities have gained on surging global risk appetite underpinned by improving macroeconomic fundamentals that have been pulling in capital inflows.",
        "Bond yields in major AEs have hardened on expectations of monetary policy normalisation, with German bunds reaching an intra-year high.",

        "It was overwhelmed, however, by capital goods, which points to continuing retrenchment of capital formation in the economy.",
        "The weakness in the capex cycle was also evident in the number of new investment announcements falling to a 12-year low in Q1, the lack of traction in the implementation of stalled projects, deceleration in the output of infrastructure goods, and the ongoing deleveraging in the corporate sector.",

        "There are, however, some moderating forces at work.",
        "First, the second successive normal monsoon coupled with effective supply management measures may keep food inflation under check.",

        "At the same time, upsides to the baseline projections emanate from the rising probability of another good kharif harvest, the boost to rural demand from the higher budgetary allocation to housing in rural areas the significant step-up in the budgetary allocation for roads and bridges, and the growth-enhancing effects of the GST, viz., the shifting of trade from unorganised to organised segments; the reduction of tax cascades; cost, efficiency and competitiveness gains; and synergies in domestic supply chains.",
        "In turn, these virtuous forces may spur investment.",
        "External demand conditions are gradually improving and should support the domestic economy, although global political risks remain significant.",
        "Keeping in view these factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has been retained at the June 2017 projection of 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",
        "The MPC observed that while inflation has fallen to a historic low, a conclusive segregation of transitory and structural factors driving the disinflation is still elusive.",
        "In respect of inflation-sensitive vegetables, prices are recording spikes.",
        "Excess supply conditions continue to push down prices of pulses and keep those of cereals in check.",
        "The MPC will continue monitoring movements in inflation to ascertain if recent soft readings are transient or if a more durable disinflation is underway.",
        "In its assessment of real activity, the MPC noted that while the outlook for agriculture appears robust, underlying growth impulses in industry and services are weakening, given corporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand.",
        "The MPC noted that some of the upside risks to inflation have either reduced or not materialised - (i) the baseline path of headline inflation excluding the HRA impact has fallen below the projection made in June to a little above 4 per cent by Q4; (ii) inflation excluding food and fuel has fallen significantly over the past three months; and, (iii) the roll-out of the GST has been smooth and the monsoon normal.",
        "Consequently, some space has opened up for monetary policy accommodation, given the dynamics of the output gap.",
        "Accordingly, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.",
        "Noting, however, that the trajectory of inflation in the baseline projection is expected to rise from current lows, the MPC decided to keep the policy stance neutral and to watch incoming data.",
        "The MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis.",
        "On the state of the economy, the MPC is of the view that there is an urgent need to reinvigorate private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks and provide a major thrust to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for housing needs of all This hinges on speedier clearance of projects by the States.",
        "On their part, the Government and the Reserve Bank are working in close coordination to resolve large stressed corporate borrowers and recapitalise public sector banks within the fiscal deficit target.",
        "These efforts should help restart credit flows to the productive sectors as demand revives.",
        "Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr.",
        "Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted for a policy rate reduction of 50 basis points and Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra voted 2017.",
        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on October 3 and 4, 2017.",
        "While a significant decline in both headline inflation and inflation excluding food and fuel provides reason for cautious optimism, it remains unclear at this juncture whether these outcomes will sustain durably in the future.",
        "In fact, it is highly likely that inflation excluding food and fuel bottomed out in June.",
        "Momentum in June headline index has also picked up (because of the seasonal rebounds of some vegetables) with a reversal in the headline inflation trajectory expected from July.",
        "However, what is encouraging is that both the 3-month and 1-year median inflation expectations are stable, despite marginal upticks.",
        "The survey of professional on key structural reforms, i.e., the GST, will be akin to a positive supply shock in the long run, and will assist in the disinflationary process.",
        "New data and information also provide more clarity on the magnitude of upside risks to headline inflation highlighted in my comments in the June review.",
        "First, there is more evidence that the current monsoon will be normal.",
        "Second, the rise in the housing price index because of HRA is likely to be more gradual than earlier envisaged.",
        "While upside risks in the form of second round effects will kick in muted because of depressed demand conditions in the real estate sector.",
        "Having said this, both farm loan waivers and proximity to the 2019 election year suggest that fiscal impulses could contribute to inflationary pressures.",
        "These need to be carefully watched.",
        "Given the above, at this juncture, I expect headline inflation to evolve in line with the medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent.",
        "A lexicographic flexible inflation-targeting mandate requires monetary policy to now accommodate the objective of growth.",
        "While re-monetisation, front loaded government expenditures and a good monsoon will sustain a positive momentum on growth, my biggest concern at the moment is the slowing rate of capital accumulation.",
        "Indebted manufacturing companies continue to de-leverage, and envisaged capex continues to decline.",
        "A prolonged period of weak investment growth will impact potential growth.",
        "Weak investment growth is also associated with slower growth in total factor productivity (TFP) in the long run which is the key driver of longterm real wage growth (after inflation).",
        "Both the industrial outlook survey and the consumer confidence survey conducted by the RBI suggest that negative output gaps will remain in Q2 also.",
        "With the US Fed announcing a somewhat gradual tapering of its balance likely to be imparted on EME exchange rates and financial markets, and needs to be carefully watched.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a 25 basis points (bps) cut Monetary Policy Committee.",
        "Retail inflation has softened, touching a new low of 1.5 per cent in June 2017, slowing mainly due to a favourable base effect, falling food prices, and decline in international prices of fuel, as well as contraction in inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Going forward, as base effects fade, some upside risks to inflation remain, including rising pressures on the price of food (especially vegetables and animal proteins), inflationary effects from implementation of farm loan waivers, and the possible rise in inflation due to implementation of house rent allowances under the 7[th] Central Pay Commission.",
        "At the same time, some upside risks to inflation have either decreased or not materialised, counterbalancing the inflationary pressures.",
        "These include a normal monsoon, along with effective supply management, smooth roll-out of the GST, continuation of moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel, and expectation of stable international commodity prices.",
        "However, continuous monitoring of incoming data is required to ascertain the extent to which the recent softening is durable.",
        "On the growth front, the agricultural sector is expected to perform strongly on account of a normal monsoon for the second successive year and well-timed sowing for the _kharif season.",
        "This is expected to further boost rural consumption, as_ evidenced by the growth in consumer non-durables.",
        "At the same time, industrial growth remains subdued on the back of sluggish demand and a consequent build-up of inventories reflected in contraction in consumer durables and capital goods.",
        "The twin problems of weak capex cycle and debt overhang have constrained the private sector from undertaking new investment.",
        "Infrastructure bottlenecks are also a major growth.",
        "Moving on to forward looking indices that predict future economic activity, growth in the Indian Leading Index (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated) is falling, as is Indian Leading Exports Index growth.",
        "These are indicative of a fading economic growth outlook, as well as a pessimistic outlook with respect to exports growth.",
        "The latter is suggest that international economic growth is about as good as it gets, and could start easing in the months ahead.",
        "Furthermore, consistent with the cyclical downturns already concerted inflation cycle downturns starting in most major economies.",
        "There is thus room for a policy repo rate cut by 25 basis points.",
        "In the MPC meeting of 7[th] June 2017, I pleaded for a rate cut of 50 basis points from 6.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent providing several reasons to do so.",
        "Most of the developments and additional data points since then have only vindicated my stand and forecasts.",
        "In my opinion, MPC should effect a major cut of 50 basis points in the policy rate without losing any more time.",
        "My reasons for this recommendation in addition to the ones I mentioned in my statement in the Minutes of the June 7, 2017 meeting of MPC are the following: 37.",
        "Subsequent to the meeting of 7[th] June 2017, the two readings of inflation for the months of May and June 2017 that came in were closer to my forecast than the expects the base inflation to be a little above 4 per cent by March 2018 without the statistical impact of the revision of HRA from the 7[th] Pay Commission.",
        "My estimates based on our independent exercise suggest that the base CPI inflation is likely to be about 50 basis points lower than the RBI forecast.",
        "Our research now provides an empirical support from the data over the last five years to the hypothesis that the headline CPI inflation in India shows a tendency to drift towards the core inflation (excluding food and fuel) in the long run and not vice versa.",
        "I had indicated a possibility of such a result in my statement in the Minutes of inflation according to our calculations is likely to show a declining trend over the coming year.",
        "The RBI has also acknowledged that the core inflation has shown a declining trend for the last three months (April, May and June).",
        "Our exercise suggests that the core inflation is on a declining path with minor spikes ultimately also to show a converging trend over long term.",
        "The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) started in May 2017 has provided two monthly India expect their cost inflation a year ahead to be around 3 per cent.",
        "This measure of inflation closely traces the CPI core inflation.",
        "It provides further support to our empirical exercise and estimates derived independently.",
        "As it is very well recognised, the fears of upside risks to inflation considered so far either have not materialised or are considerably subdued except the statistical impact of the implementation of revised HRA for the government employees.",
        "The HRA impact in any case is a transient influence and not a permanent factor for inflation.",
        "However, this influence is hikes by different states.",
        "Monsoon for the second consecutive year is likely to be normal and progressing well.",
        "Procurement during the last year, some reforms in the agricultural sector and improvements in the logistics enabled by the introduction of GST may help keep the food inflation under control.",
        "budget announced subsequently by the UP state government has absorbed the below the fiscal responsibility legislation (FRL) target of 3 per cent.",
        "Some of the states have staggered the implementation and others are yet to work out implementation details.",
        "The argument that state fiscal deficits are usually understated by unrealistic assumptions on their revenues may not apply when we have evidence to expect high revenue buoyancy for both the direct and indirect taxes in the country.",
        "Thus, the developments on this front so far do not suggest a serious threat to inflation on account of fiscal slippage.",
        "On the other hand, capacity utilisation has been consistently below 75 per cent now for a long time.",
        "The industrial outlook survey and household expectations survey by the RBI do not paint a rosy picture of the economy.",
        "The manufacturing purchasing continually appreciated and exports are not doing well.",
        "Investment demand is not picking up.",
        "Simultaneously, several major reforms including GST have started enhancing the efficiency of the system and raising revenue buoyancy enabling the governments to spend more on capacity creating projects and schemes.",
        "This is likely to result in raising potential output and its growth.",
        "All these observations point not only to the existence but expansion of negative output gap in the economy.",
        "It is important to note that output gap in this context is the difference between the level of realised output and the level of potential output, which would have a direct bearing on the inflation rate.",
        "Difference between actual growth and potential growth rates to measure the output gap in this context is a misconception and can be misleading for the policy purposes because higher actual growth than the potential growth need not necessarily result in a positive output gap or even in narrowing the negative output gap.",
        "With this clarity and all above observations on the output front, expanding negative output gap in India cannot be wished away, but needs immediate aggressive policy action to correct it.",
        "Persistence of negative output gap imposes severe social costs on the economy that is largely borne by the poor and the unemployed.",
        "The basic purpose of Flexible Inflation Targeting framework according to me is to move away consciously from the Activist Discretion-based policy to Rule-based inflation forecast now brought down to 4 per cent by the RBI and existence of expanding negative output gap, any rule-based policy would suggest a cut in the policy rate by at least 50 basis points.",
        "My forecasts and arguments above suggest space for even higher cut.",
        "However, exercising caution and waiting for further vindication of my stand and forecasts by data and facts, I vote for a cut of 50 basis points in the policy rate at this stage.",
        "In my opinion, the neutral policy stance needs to be seriously reconsidered in favour of the accommodative stance given the above arguments.",
        "I have consistently maintained that an inflation targeting framework has to be forward-looking.",
        "Setting monetary policy by looking over the shoulder at inflation prints of the recent past runs the risk of time inconsistency with respect to the target.",
        "A good example of forward-looking time-consistent monetary policy is the monetary in October 2016, the MPC took monetary policy action that was consistent.",
        "To be inconsistent and will undermine credibility.",
        "More than 70 percent of respondents expect prices to increase, with the sharpest rise expected in prices of household durable goods, followed by prices of historic low.",
        "Professional forecasters, who are regarded as forward-looking, also see inflation rising over the rest of the year.",
        "In this context, I have also consistently held that in reading forecasts, it is the direction rather than the level that matters.",
        "First, the increase of 106 per cent in house rent allowance for central government its maximum effect in December.",
        "Given this incremental pattern of build-up, it could potentially stir up second order effects even as the first order impact is getting complete.",
        "Second, there is uncertainty around the inflationary impact of the roll-out unwinding of arrangements that were made to prepare for initial difficulties in pass through of tax credits.",
        "My sense is that one-off inflation effects could emerge in the this should go to the top of the hierarchy of moving parts.",
        "Fourth, seasonal spikes in inflation-sensitive food prices are already in evidence.",
        "The question is: will there be spillovers that induce generalisation of the inflation momentum?",
        "All these factors could come together in CPI readings from August.",
        "If that turns out to be the case, why not stay on hold now, watch the shape and slope of the upturn and if it is benign, deliver credible monetary policy that supports the economy?",
        "In the context of the latter, it is paradoxical that weak aspects of economic activity are shows that it is expected to accelerate in 2017-18!",
        "The financial environment is bubbly and frothy.",
        "The combination of high valuations in equity and fixed income markets, an appreciating currency and the persistence of a liquidity overhang in the money market is a perfect recipe for a financial imbalance.",
        "A rate cut can amplify it if the central bank is seen as encouraging risk-taking.",
        "In the run-up to the formal institution of the new monetary policy framework, achieved with a considerable amount of good luck (collapse of international crude prices; new CPI index; demonetisation; favourable supply shocks).",
        "Now that we are in a formal inflation targeting framework, why not strive to achieve the mandated target with good policy?",
        "I vote for status quo.",
        "Inflation prints since the last policy have turned out even lower, though there are emerging signs that certain deflating food items are on a price rebound.",
        "Excluding the HRA impact, headline inflation is now projected to be lower in Q4 of 2017-18 as compared with the projection made in the last policy statement.",
        "More significantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has eased markedly, falling to around 4 per cent and suggesting a broad-based weakening of underlying demand.",
        "Our 12month ahead headline inflation projection, without the statistical HRA effects, is now just above 4 per cent, even as the inflation path is projected to be on an upward even in the face of recent low inflation prints.",
        "Our output gap estimates turned somewhat negative after the last quarter's growth numbers and associated revisions.",
        "Together with easing of underlying inflation and given that our 12-month ahead inflation forecast (excluding the HRA impact) is in line with the mandated target, there seems some room for monetary policy accommodation.",
        "Hence, I vote for a policy repo rate cut by 25 basis points while retaining the neutral stance.",
        "Why the neutral stance?",
        "I wish to reiterate that growth slowdown since Q1 2016-17 is rooted in the stressed balance-sheets of our banks and corporates in several sectors.",
        "Our output gap estimates that account for financing conditions using recent modelling advances do pick up this protracted slowdown.",
        "To address this, our efforts on stressed asset resolution are firmly underway.",
        "This very stress has also resulted in poor transmission of monetary policy (except after demonetisation, and only for fresh rupee loans, as bank deposits surged).",
        "In my assessment, therefore, our focus at the present juncture should be on improving the conditions for sound transmission such as healthy bank and corporate balance sheets, market-based benchmarking of bank lending rates and a thriving corporate bond market.",
        "Higher real rates are justified in the meantime as absent efficient transmission, attempts to address symptoms of balance-sheet problems with aggressive monetary easing get wasted and can even backfire by misallocating investments, fuelling asset price inflation, creating false hopes of a growth boost, and relaxing the pedal on deeper structural reforms.",
        "I remain concerned about the impact of farm loan waivers on inflation and growth, due to induced departure from fiscal discipline, shift in the nature of state spending and the crowding out of private credit by further state borrowings from the market.",
        "Given the additional uncertainty around how much of the real-time economic indicator surprises are due to the likely temporary impact of the GST rollout on business activity, careful scrutiny of upcoming data seems necessary.",
        "Hence, I prefer to keep the monetary stance neutral.",
        "Excluding the house rent allowance (HRA) impact under the 7[th] central pay commission (CPC), the current assessment is that inflation during Q4 of 2017-18 would be lower than what it was projected in the last monetary policy review.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has also softened over the last three months.",
        "Seasonally adjusted momentum moderated during this period.",
        "Available forward industrial outlook survey and the consumer confidence survey do not suggest much risk of immediate demand pressures.",
        "While the growth outlook in terms of projected GVA growth for 2017-18 is retained unchanged at 7.3 per cent, there are some signs of downside risks on the underlying growth momentum in industry and services.",
        "A normal monsoon for the second year in succession should help sustain some of the disinflationary impulses in food items that generally accompany improved supply conditions.",
        "The moderation in pulses prices is likely to continue in the medium-term on account of favourable supply conditions.",
        "I vote in favour of a cut in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.",
        "While using the space available for monetary accommodation to support growth, we retain the monetary policy stance as neutral for the following reasons.",
        "First, disentangling recent disinflation in terms of relative roles of structural and transitory drivers remains a challenge.",
        "Second, HRA will push up the inflation trajectory.",
        "Even if one excludes the direct HRA impact, one has to be vigilant about the second order effects, especially on inflation expectations as States would also start implementing revision in salary and allowances.",
        "Third, inflation expectations of households edged up even in an atmosphere of significant disinflation.",
        "Fourth, specific food items such as tomato exhibited sharp price pressures in recent weeks, which were not reflected in the low June 2017 inflation print.",
        "The present low level of food prices is unusual and is vulnerable to upward pressures.",
        "An assessment of whether the recent deflation in food items is sustainable, despite a normal monsoon, would require more hard data going forward.",
        "Fifth, while the frontloaded expenditure by the Central Government so far during the year has provided a boost to the economy, the implementation of farm debt waivers by the State Governments has significantly increased the fiscal risks and poses an upside risk to the inflation outlook.",
        "Effective transmission of a policy rate cut is the key to achieving the goal of While the transmission has improved, there is still some space for banks to cut their lending rates, especially on the existing loan portfolios.",
        "Credit growth has also been low partly because of risk aversion among banks on account of their stressed assets position.",
        "Resolution of stressed balance sheets of banks, therefore, will remain important for reviving credit demand and the investment cycle.",
        "The third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on February 7 and 8, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.",
        "The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr.",

        "According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on resolutions adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub-section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.",
        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Global growth is projected to pick up modestly in 2017, after slowing down in the year gone by.",
        "Advanced economies (AEs) are expected to build upon the slow gathering of momentum that started in the second half of 2016, led by the US and Japan.",
        "However, uncertainty surrounds the direction of US macroeconomic policies with potential global spillovers.",
        "Growth prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs) are also expected to improve moderately, with recessionary conditions ebbing in Russia and Brazil, and China stabilising on policy stimulus.",
        "Inflation is edging up on the back of rising energy prices and a mild firming up of demand.",
        "However, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions.",
        "Furthermore, financial conditions are likely to tighten as central banks in AEs normalise exceptional accommodation in monetary policy.",
        "9. International financial markets turned volatile from mid-January on concerns of the new US administration.",
        "Within the rising profile of international commodity prices, metals have also increased on expectations of fiscal stimulus in the US, strong infrastructure spending in China, and supply reductions.",
        "Geopolitical concerns have also hardened commodity prices.",
        "More recently, the appetite for risk has returned in AEs, buoying equity markets and hardening bond yields as a response to the growing likelihood of further increases in the Federal Funds rate during the year.",
        "Coupled with expectations of fiscal expansion in the US, this has propelled the US dollar to a multi-year high.",
        "The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its advance estimates for 2016-17 on cent (first revised estimates released on January 31) a year ago.",
        "Agriculture and allied activities posted a strong pick-up, benefiting from the normal south-west monsoon, robust expansion in _rabi acreage (higher by 5.7 per cent over the preceding year) and favourable_ base effects as well as the continuing resilience of allied activities.",
        "In contrast, the industrial sector experienced a sharp deceleration, mainly due to a slowdown in manufacturing and in mining and quarrying.",
        "Service sector activity also lost pace, concentrated in trade, hotels, transport and communication services, and construction, cushioned to some extent by public administration and defence.",
        "Industrial output measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) finally shrugged off the debilitating drag from insulated rubber cables from November and was also pushed up by a favourable base effect.",
        "In December, the output of core industries accelerated on a yearon-year as well as on a sequentially seasonally adjusted basis.",
        "The drivers of the upturn were steel production and petroleum refinery throughput, the former, _inter alia, supported by_ import tariff safeguards and the latter buoyed by external demand.",
        "The acceleration in coal production and thermal electricity generation since November after three consecutive months of contraction augur well for the outlook for power.",
        "Reflecting these developments, the the back of growth of new orders and output, and the future output index has risen strongly.",
        "that financing conditions facing the manufacturing sector have worsened in Q3 of 2016-17 and are expected to remain tight in Q4.",
        "This is corroborated by the sharp slowdown in bank credit to industry and continuing sluggishness in the investment climate in some sectors.",
        "High frequency indicators point to subdued activity in the services sector, particularly automobile sales across all segments, domestic air cargo, railway freight traffic, and cement production.",
        "Nevertheless, some areas stand out as bright spots, having weathered the transient tourist arrivals; tractor sales; and, cellular telephone subscribers.",
        "The services PMI for January 2017 remained in retrenchment, but the fall in output was the least in the current phase of three consecutive months of contraction.",
        "Marking the fifth consecutive month of softening, retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) turned down sharper than expected in December and reached its lowest reading since November 2014.",
        "This outcome was driven by deflation in the prices of vegetables and pulses.",
        "Some moderation in the rate of increase in prices of 14.",
        "Excluding food and fuel, inflation has been unyielding at 4.9 per cent since September.",
        "While some part of this inertial behaviour is attributable to the turnaround in inflation, particularly in housing, health, education, personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver) as well as miscellaneous goods and services consumed by households.",
        "The large overhang of liquidity consequent upon demonetisation weighed on money markets in December, but from mid-January rebalancing has been underway with expansion of currency in circulation and new bank notes being injected into the system at an accelerated absorption mode.",
        "With the abolition of the incremental cash reserve ratio from December 10, liquidity management operations have consisted of variable rate reverse repos under the LAF of tenors ranging from overnight to 91 days and auctions of cash management bills under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) of tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days.",
        "The average daily net absorption under the LAF was ` 1.6 trillion in December, ` 2.0 trillion in January and ` 3.7 trillion in February (up to February 7) while under the MSS, it was ` 3.8 trillion, ` 5.0 trillion and ` 2.9 trillion, respectively.",
        "Money market rates remained aligned with the policy repo rate albeit with a soft bias, with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) averaging 18 basis points below the policy rate during December and January.",
        "Turning to the external sector, export growth remained in the positive zone for the fourth month in succession in December.",
        "Imports other than petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) came out of the spike in November and moderated in December.",
        "In contrast, there was an increase of over 10 per cent in POL imports, in part reflecting the rise in international crude oil prices.",
        "Overall, the trade deficit shrank both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, being lower for the period April-December by US$ 23.5 billion than its level a year ago.",
        "On the whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted and below 1 per cent of GDP in 2016-17.",
        "While the buoyancy in net foreign direct investment was sustained, there have been portfolio outflows beginning October on uncertainty relating to the direction of US macroeconomic policies and expectations of faster normalisation of US monetary policy in 17.",
        "In the fifth bi-monthly statement of December, headline inflation was projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks lower than before but still tilted to the upside.",
        "The decline in headline CPI inflation in November and December has been larger than expected, but almost exclusively on the back of deflation in vegetables and pulses.",
        "While the seasonal ebb in the prices of vegetables that usually occurs with the onset of winter as well as some demand compression may have contributed to this outcome, anecdotal evidence points to some distress sales of perishables having accentuated the decline in vegetable prices, with spillovers into January as well.",
        "Looking beyond, prices of pulses are likely to remain soft with comfortable supply conditions, while vegetable prices may potentially rebound as the effects of demonetisation wear off.",
        "The Committee is of the view that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger secondorder effects.",
        "Nevertheless, headline CPI inflation in Q4 of 2016-17 is likely to be below 5 per cent.",
        "Favourable base effects and lagged effects of demand compression may mute headline inflation in Q1 of 2017-18.",
        "Thereafter, it is expected to pick up momentum, especially as growth picks up and the output gap narrows.",
        "Moreover, base effects will reverse and turn adverse during Q3 and Q4 of 2017-18.",
        "Accordingly, inflation is projected in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent in the second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path (Chart 1).",
        "In this context, it is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty the exchange rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressures to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7[th] Central Pay Commission (CPC) award which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path.",
        "The focus of the Union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence should bode well for limiting upside risks to inflation.",
        "GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent with risks evenly balanced around it.",
        "Growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of several factors.",
        "First, discretionary consumer demand held back by demonetisation is expected to bounce back beginning in the closing months of 2016-17.",
        "Second, economic activity in cashintensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored.",
        "Third, demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLRs), and in turn, to lending rates for healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand.",
        "Fourth, the emphasis in the Union Budget for 2017-18 on stepping up capital expenditure, and boosting the rural economy and affordable housing should contribute to growth.",
        "Accordingly, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 7.4 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",
        "The Committee remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner.",
        "This requires further significant decline in inflation expectations, especially since the services component of inflation that is sensitive to wage movements has been sticky.",
        "The committee decided to change the stance from accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold to assess how the transitory effects of demonetisation on inflation and the output gap play out.",
        "The Reserve Bank has conducted market liquidity operations consistent with the liquidity management framework put in place in April 2016, progressively moving the system level _ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality.",
        "This stance will continue._ Surplus liquidity should decline with progressive remonetisation.",
        "Nonetheless, the currently abundant liquidity with banks is likely to persist into the early months of 2017-18.",
        "The Reserve Bank is committed to ensuring efficient and appropriate liquidity management with all the instruments at its command to ensure close alignment of the WACR with the policy rate, improved transmission of policy impulses to lending rates, and adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy.",
        "The Committee believes that the environment for timely transmission of policy rates the banking sector is hastened; and, (iii) the formula for adjustments in the interest rates on small savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturity is fully implemented.",
        "Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision.",
        "The minutes of the Since the introduction of the formula in April 2016, interest rates on small savings are about 65-100 basis points higher, depending on tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed.",
        "If the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide, the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full transmission to bank lending rates.",
        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on April 5 and 6, 2017.",
        "The Union budget has largely adhered to a path of fiscal consolidation as shown in both the continuous decline in the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit.",
        "The focus in the budget on reducing revenue expenditure without compromising on capital expenditure suggests that the budget will not add to the inflationary momentum of the economy.",
        "There is more clarity on the impact of demonetisation on real output in terms of its temporary component and its permanent component.",
        "The temporary (adverse) effect is getting reversed as the economy remonetises.",
        "This is confirmed by various enterprise surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank since the last review.",
        "What is a little more uncertain is the permanent effect, which will operate through wealth destruction, and work more gradually.",
        "Even so, the permanent (adverse) effect is not likely to be large in the long run.",
        "Overall, and as I mentioned in the last review, it appears that uncertainty on the production side has largely been mitigated.",
        "Since I do not see a persistent opening up of the output gap because of demonetisation, this does not warrant a rate cut.",
        "Unlike production, uncertainty in the price level persists because of demonetisation obfuscating some of the trends that existed before November 8.",
        "While both 3 month and 1 year median inflationary expectations have fallen, it is unclear whether this will sustain.",
        "While fire sales have led to vegetable prices collapsing, vegetables always have a seasonal rebound.",
        "In fact, inflation net of vegetables continues to remain at 4.8 per cent, and momentum in food inflation increased in December.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel remains sticky, and since it is above headline inflation, this will exert upward pressure on headline inflation.",
        "These arguments suggest that a quicker pace of disinflation may not sustain on a durable basis.",
        "With a shift in focus towards the mid-point of the medium-term inflation target of 4 +/- 2 per cent, these arguments warrant no change in the policy rate.",
        "While the Indian economy is very different now compared to the summer of 2013, the impact on financial markets of the possible ending of re-investment of principal payments by 29.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate 30.",
        "While the transitory effects of demonetisation on inflation and output gap have yet to be fully assessed, the ratio of currency in circulation to GDP is on the rise, suggesting that remonetisation is progressing well.",
        "Furthermore, in the aftermath of demonetisation, due to the increase in liquidity with the banks, banks have already reduced the marginal-cost-based lending rates which should fuel demand in the economy.",
        "The Budget is also conducive to growth in the key sectors and is expected to have multiplier effects.",
        "On the inflation front, while CPI inflation has softened primarily due to lower food prices, core inflation (excluding food and fuel) remains sticky, close to 5 per cent, partly due to rising international commodity prices.",
        "The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the Reserve Bank also indicates that core CPI inflation is likely to remain sticky around 5 per cent till Q3-201718.",
        "On the external front, exports growth is likely to continue to provide support to the economy, but volatility in the foreign exchange markets is a concern.",
        "Moreover, while the US Fed maintained the status quo on interest rates, it is expected to hike rates in the future.",
        "Furthermore, the international leading indexes produced by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) indicate stronger global growth and inflation prospects for the anticipates U.S. inflation) points to further increases in inflation.",
        "Further, the strength in leading indexes of U.S. economic growth signal higher economic growth.",
        "Both these factors may be consistent with multiple Fed rate hikes this year.",
        "Taking the above considerations into account, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent.",
        "Surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to provide input for the Monetary Policy indicate that: a) the capacity utilisation may decline marginally; b) cost of raw materials is likely to rise and firms may lose pricing power; c) investment outlook may remain subdued; d) lack of clearances and lack of funds are the major reasons for the stalled projects; e) inflationary expectations are declining for three months and one year ahead; and f) sentiments on employment and household income have worsened.",
        "These findings are consistent with our view that demonetisation of high value currency notes would have transitory adverse impact on growth of income and employment.",
        "The Economic Survey 2016-17 by the Ministry of Finance also corroborates the transitory nature of the impact though their estimate case there is a general agreement that the growth in the coming quarters is likely to pick up with the economy returning to its pre-demonetisation growth path.",
        "In this context, the Union Budget for the year 2017-18 presented on the 1[st] February 2017 has been very pragmatic and disciplined providing adequate boost to help the economy return to its pre-demonetisation growth path.",
        "However, the State Budgets have been the cause of concern of late because the movement in their fiscal deficits largely determines the variation in the combined fiscal deficit of the country.",
        "States have now started forming a larger proportion of the public expenditures and having a clear idea on their fiscal deficits is important for the monetary policy.",
        "While the commodity prices are firming up, the wholesale price index (WPI) for manufacturing shows very low inflation.",
        "Since the items affected by it in the CPI do not have high weightage, the CPI inflation without food and fuel continues to be high around 5 per cent.",
        "The decline in overall CPI inflation is not reliably stable because it is mainly on account of vegetables and pulses coupled with the transitory impact of demonetisation.",
        "As the transitory impact of demonetisation recedes and remonetisation sets in, the environment, the real neutral rate of interest in India seems to be higher than the one for most of the developed countries.",
        "However, their future policy direction indicates rapid strengthening of the rates.",
        "Given all these factors, it is prudent not to tinker with the policy rate at this stage.",
        "In any case, under the given circumstances and reasonable forecasts for the future, I find the current rate to be optimal for liquidity in the economy.",
        "Therefore, a change of stance from accommodative to neutral at this stage is desirable.",
        "It can impart the necessary flexibility for the monetary policy in future to respond to any development on either side.",
        "I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and for starting the withdrawal from accommodation in the policy stance for three compelling reasons.",
        "First, the recent sharp disinflation is entirely driven by transitory forces.",
        "Underneath, there is a broader-based firming up of inflation pressures.",
        "Excluding vegetables, CPI inflation was 4.8 per cent, 136 basis points above the headline number of 3.4 per cent in December.",
        "Vegetable prices may have been impacted by demonetisation, but they also exhibit strong seasonal behaviour and tend to turn up as the winter gets over.",
        "Excluding food, inflation was 4.7 per cent; and excluding both food and fuel, inflation was 4.9 per cent.",
        "Moreover, all of these levels have become persistent since September 2016.",
        "Secondly, the reflationary effects of remonetisation are likely being underestimated in the commentary around it.",
        "With transactions requirement of currency amply met, the positive shock that is travelling through the economy can be expected to fuel inflation well before the more sluggishly moving activity and demand respond.",
        "If the seasonal upturn in vegetables prices and these reflationary effects coincide as they might by as early as March-April, monetary policy needs to be preemptively on guard.",
        "Thirdly and importantly, forward-lookingness necessitated by lags in transmission requires deviations out of the tolerance limits around the target for nine months consecutively will no longer be tolerated.",
        "This acquires some urgency because the tailwinds that propelled inflation down through 2014-17, some fortuitous like the collapse of international commodity prices, do not appear to be in sight over the next 12-month horizon.",
        "Instead, upside risks from global financial turbulence, international crude prices and a less than normal south west monsoon could individually materialise and even intensify together into a perfect storm.",
        "It is eminently possible that the reasons cited above do not turn out to be so compelling and even dissipate.",
        "That will open up headroom for monetary policy to more directly address the objective of growth.",
        "If, on the other hand, they turn out to be real and present dangers, it is vital to unfetter monetary policy from a unidirectional stance.",
        "This was a tough policy decision to take.",
        "On the one hand, headline inflation has remained low, and there is a good case to be made that there is at least a temporary output gap created due to liquidity shortage induced by the currency replacement.",
        "Since our flexible inflation targeting mandate also requires paying attention to growth, it could be natural to lower the policy rate to restore growth levels, especially if the lower policy rate could be passed onto the areas of the economy most affected by the liquidity shortage, in particular, rural households, non-bank finance corporations which undertake most of the auto-based lending, and the realty sector.",
        "On the other hand, low headline inflation has been largely driven by food deflation, and the most recent numbers have been heavily driven by the large dip in vegetable prices.",
        "In the past, food deflation has had strong seasonal patterns which have tended to rebound and with vengeance when rainfall disappoints.",
        "While some of the food deflation over the past few months has been steady due to supply-side factors, on balance it is fair to draw the conclusion that statistically, food component of headline inflation has had less signal to noise quality compared to the core inflation that excludes fuel and food, the latter having been more or less sticky in recent months.",
        "Rapid remonetisation implies likely swift reversal of the aggregate demand loss and the significant transmission to borrowers of easy funding conditions at banks suggests unlikely further transmission of a rate cut by banks.",
        "Given the difficulty in resolving this trade-off between temporary effects on output gap and the persistent nature of core inflation, my attention turned heavily to international factors.",
        "Global uncertainty in trade due to protectionist tendencies in major developed economies, the prospect of a stronger dollar in wake of a probable \"border tax\" on imports in the US, and rising world-wide inflation in food, fuel and metals, have created a significant risk to domestic inflation.",
        "Second-round effects on funding costs due to portfolio outflows from debt and equity markets could be substantial if the central bank is not perceived as staying course on credible inflation targeting.",
        "It is important to guard the Indian macro-economy from global headwinds, and having a reasonably good chance of attaining the 5 per cent target for headline inflation by end of March 2017, to keep the option open to start getting closer to our long-term target of 4 per cent headline inflation on a durable basis.",
        "Overall, this required no rate cut for now and switching to a neutral stance so as to remain fully flexible to raise rates, or to stay put, or to cut rates, as more data becomes available on both domestic and international fronts.",
        "One final note on the monetary policy decision: The balanced budget, by focusing on fiscal stability and expenditure reorientation to rural and housing, seemed to exonerate the Committee from the burden of skewing rates to bridge the output gap and instead allowed the Committee to focus squarely on the inflation-targeting mandate.",
        "Such a time, while difficult for interest-rate setting, appears right for pushing forward on structural reforms of the banking sector: its asset quality and resolution, and its recapitalisation needs - both factors that have stunted credit growth at banks; and, the normalisation of administered small savings rates that have prevented a seamless transmission of monetary policy to bank funding and lending rates.",
        "The short-run assessment of evolving macroeconomic conditions remains clouded.",
        "On the inflation outlook, transient factors, including anecdotal evidence on fire sales of perishables, have discoloured an objective assessment of inflation pressures in recent months.",
        "Past experience suggests that the rebound in vegetable prices could be sharper than normal.",
        "Importantly, non-food non-fuel inflation has remained sticky, notwithstanding the transitory impact of demonetisation on consumption demand.",
        "Crude oil and commodity prices (including for food) have firmed up globally, thereby potentially raising risks to the headline inflation.",
        "Domestic industrial input and farm costs, including rural wages, have increased in recent months.",
        "_Inter alia cost push effects of 7[th] pay commission allowances,_ and exchange rate volatility arising from possible shifts in risk premia on a full rollout of US macroeconomic policies impart uncertainty to the inflation trajectory going ahead.",
        "With the remonetisation of the economy taking place at an accelerated pace over the last two months, economic activity is expected to pick up from the latter part of Q4 of 201617.",
        "Discretionary consumer demand, which got impacted in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation, is expected to bounce back.",

        "Global growth is projected to be higher in 2017 than 2016.",
        "These factors, along with improved monetary transmission, have markedly improved growth prospects for 2017-18 compared to the current year.",
        "While pursuing 4 per cent CPI headline inflation that became effective from August 2016 as per the Gazette notification, it is necessary to adopt a calibrated approach so as to minimise the collateral costs of achieving the target as well as ensure its durability.",
        "By shifting the stance of monetary policy from accommodative to neutral, there will now be sufficient flexibility to move the policy rate in either direction, depending on future data outcomes and projections, to help ensure that inflation is brought closer to 4 per cent.",

        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.50 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",

        "In the Euro area, the recovery has been underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing and industrial activity are driving an acceleration in growth.",
        "Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back domestic demand.",
        "Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could impinge on the outlook.",
        "Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil.",
        "In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with improving macro fundamentals.",
        "South Africa is grappling with structural constraints which are depressing economic activity.",
        "The pick-up in global merchandise trade volume since the start of the year has been sustained in Q2 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in rising international air freight and container throughput.",

        "Country-specific factors have modulated investor sentiment.",
        "Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2, surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area.",

        "The monsoon is likely to be normal and may help to sustain the low food inflation trajectory.",

        "There are several noteworthy developments recently on prices and output fronts that warrant a decisive policy action by the MPC.",
        "In my opinion, this is the most opportune time for the MPC to effect a major cut of 50 basis points in the policy rate to bring it down from 6.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent.",
        "My reasons for this recommendation are the following: 38.",
        "After the MPC meeting of April 2017, the two monthly readings of the CPI combined inflation turned out to be more consistent with my forecast stated in the Minutes of the previous meeting than of the RBI forecast.",
        "The core inflation figures also vindicated my view about a clear declining trend rather than stickiness as predicted in the RBI forecast.",
        "Now the RBI has also revised their forecast of CPIheadline inflation downward to 2 - 3.5 per cent during the first half; and 3.5 - 4.5 per cent during the second half of 2017-18.",
        "Though my forecasts now are lower than essential point is that the expected headline CPI inflation over the next 12 months is expected to ease by at least 50 basis points compared to the April meeting of the MPC.",
        "The 3-months and 12-months advance inflationary expectations as per the RBI survey of households are unambiguously declining and are among the lowest levels observed in the history of such surveys.",
        "On the other hand, capacity utilization has persistently remained below 75 per cent now for a long time indicating existence of a large output gap.",
        "Although precise measurement of the output gap is highly controversial particularly for a rapidly developing country like India, there cannot be disagreement on the Indian economy significantly under-performing compared to its potential now for quite some time.",
        "Moreover, recent policy reforms in the country would certainly lead to the increased potential output and growth in the economy implying persistent if not widening output gap in the near to medium term.",
        "If any unanticipated inflationary pressures arise in future, they are likely to be substantially subdued by the presence of the high output gap.",
        "Given the change in the outlook and assessment of the inflation and output over time, any theoretical rule-based policy for flexible inflation targeting would not only justify but also necessitate at least 50 basis point cut in the policy rate.",
        "This is because, if we are consistent, we must consider changes in the values of the critical parameters during the period since the last meeting of the MPC.",
        "Even under the most conservative estimates of the multipliers indicating the assumed sacrifice ratio, a minimum of 50 basis point cut in the policy rate is suggested.",
        "If we consider more realistic estimates of the sacrifice ratio for India, the policy rate cut could be even higher.",
        "The monsoon forecasts released on 6[th] June, 2017 have created optimism for the second consecutive good year for agricultural production since the rainfall is expected to be higher at 98 per cent than 96 per cent of the long term average and would be geographically well distributed.",
        "Thus, the momentum pick up in agricultural inflation during the next 12 months is substantially less probable with obvious favorable impact on the headline CPI inflation.",
        "43. International developments on oil price front are again not posing major threats.",
        "In my opinion, oil prices are likely to remain within the narrow range observed in recent times.",
        "Any breach on either side may not last for a longer time.",
        "I would not consider any major upside risk to the domestic headline inflation on this count.",
        "Stable or appreciating exchange rate provides enough incentives for the FII and FDI particularly when there is a high degree of political stability; and when the observed Indian growth rate of output is among the highest in the world.",
        "US Fed rate hike is already factored in by the markets and no surprises are expected on its count.",
        "The 7[th] CPC recommendations on HRA can at best be implemented by the Centre and only a few states during the year 2017-18.",
        "The impact assessment on the headline CPI inflation of about 150 basis points by the RBI is highly overstated because it assumes simultaneous and instantaneous implementation of the recommended HRA by the 7th CPC in the Centre and ALL states almost immediately.",
        "The impact of its implementation only by the Centre would be about 36 basis points over a six months period and about 106 basis points over a six months period if ALL states implement the recommendations together given the sampling design and methodology of estimating CPI-combined.",
        "In all probability, the impact on this count on the headline CPI inflation during 2017-18 would not be more than 50 basis points.",
        "On the other hand, it is most likely to be more than off-set by the implementation of GST in its present form.",
        "There are concerns about the recent farm loan waivers announced by a couple of states.",
        "It is feared that it can lead to fiscal profligacy by other states too and result in significant increase in the fiscal deficits by the states jeopardizing the fiscal discipline and prudent levels of debt by states.",
        "In this context, we must note that states are bound by their own Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs) and that every state has it in place.",
        "So far, states have been behaving very responsibly and have collectively reduced their fiscal deficits and debt consistently.",
        "Now for quite some time, they have been borrowing directly from the market and their fiscal performance has a direct bearing on their interest costs.",
        "As a result, it is not justifiable to assume that loan waivers would directly and proportionately result in increasing their fiscal deficits.",
        "Actually, during 2017-18, they have budgeted to reduce their combined fiscal deficit by 70 basis points.",
        "The other possibilities for the states are that they may get more revenues from the implementation of GST (which are not budgeted by them) and/or that they may reallocate some of their expenditures to accommodate the loan waivers.",
        "So long as the aggregate fiscal deficit of the states does not increase, its inflationary impacts are not going to be felt.",
        "Moreover, not all states are likely to follow the suit and certainly not during the same year.",
        "Even if we consider that the loan waivers are granted immediately and they result in the increased fiscal deficit, their impact on the inflation would occur only with a considerable time-lag.",
        "Hence, these inflation risks, if at all, are in distant future and under normal circumstances are not very probable.",
        "It is altogether a different issue whether the loan waivers by some states is the least distorting and inflation impacting option among the alternatives available to address the problem.",
        "It need not be a concern for the MPC.",
        "GST implementation is most likely to create demand for the working capital credit from the banking sector.",
        "Similarly, the corporate bond market needs to be given a boost.",
        "All in all, the prevailing inflation and output conditions and prospects are such that there is enough space for a substantial rate cut of 50 basis points if not more.",
        "The risk factors appear to be highly mitigated and the probability of circumstances developing to reverse the decision is very low if not non-existent.",
        "Under such circumstances, becoming cautious and not acting amounts to ignoring all costs associated with not supporting growth in terms of unemployment and poverty reduction.",
        "Becoming too overcautious under such circumstances is against the principle of prudence.",
        "In fact, prudence lies in creating space when conditions are favorable and risks are not high than waiting and losing the opportunity.",
        "In case, the conditions were really to turn unfavorable in future, the costs to the society would be severe if during the right time expansionary policies are not followed.",
        "I, therefore, strongly plead to the MPC to effect a 50 basis points cut in the policy rate without losing any time.",
        "An inflation targeting framework is inherently forward-looking.",
        "The focus has to be on steering the trajectory of inflation towards its target over the medium-term and dealing with the risks around it, not on conducting monetary policy by looking at the rear-view mirror (the most recent inflation prints) or deviations of recent outcomes 50.",
        "It is hard to believe that deflation of 15.9 per cent in the prices of pulses and 8.6 per cent in the prices of vegetables is the steady state that will define the medium-term food inflation path.",
        "Not when agricultural wages have risen by 8.5 per cent, farm input costs by 10 per cent, bank credit to agriculture by 13.5 per cent in the year just gone by and the output gap in agriculture is turning positive on rising rural incomes!",
        "As regards fuel, the wedge in fuel inflation between urban and rural households has closed at an elevated level.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel has turned down in three readings now, but it is still not generalized and projections still run ahead of headline inflation in the rest of 2017-18.",
        "Turning to cyclical factors, households seem to be discounting the near-term and consequently, they expect inflation to rise faster a year ahead than in the next three months.",
        "Moreover, an output gap calculated on data for 2016-17 that profile a slowdown will, by definition, be negative and wider than otherwise.",
        "For an economy that is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2017-18, however, it must be the case that the output gap would narrow and close.",
        "Meanwhile, the MPC has highlighted elements to look out for: the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon; fiscal slippages; global political and financial risks; and the disbursement of allowances 52.",
        "In the revised inflation trajectory for the first half of 2017-18, the near term inflation outlook is admittedly benign.",
        "Yet, in a situation in which transitory and structural factors are meshed and difficult to decouple, apparently divergent messages emanate from the few data points that are available at this stage.",
        "Without more clarity, it is possible to make policy errors that can be large and costly in the medium-term.",
        "Accordingly, I vote to wait and watch the incoming data while retaining the flexibility of a neutral stance.",
        "The softness of April inflation prints, in food, and excluding food and fuel, as well as of the CSO's revised estimates of growth for 2016-17, especially Q4, has posed difficult challenges for monetary policy.",
        "Our inflation forecasts relied on evidence of gradual reversal after fire sales in several food items, which were partly confirmed by February and March reversion, as well as on the seasonal uptick in food prices during summer.",
        "Realized food inflation, however, turned out to be much lower than our forecast.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel also moderated.",
        "The global and goods-and-services tax (GST) related risks, that we have been concerned about, haven't materialized.",
        "One needs to wait for some more time to ascertain whether our unwinding of its asset purchase program; we might see a pick-up in imported inflation be entirely benign for inflation.",
        "It is the collapse of food inflation, however, that remains the primary driver of a steady decline in the headline number.",
        "It is clear now that supply factors, in addition to transitory effects, have been playing a significant role for at least three quarters with no sign yet of abating.",
        "The growth slowdown has had two primary components: one, the continuing decline in private investment since the beginning of 2016-17; and second, the more recent fall in construction activity that is also evidenced in the poor performance of cement industry and real estate services.",
        "Have we managed food inflation to a stable level so that the medium-term headline inflation path will remain firmly anchored below 4 per cent?",
        "While the continuing food disinflation due to supply-side measures in some high-weight food items would suggest so, farmer demands one is witnessing with each passing day gives me a pause.",
        "I remain concerned though that this may have sown the seeds of a \"tail risk\" in the form of fiscally expansive measures that could spark off generalized inflation in due course.",
        "The growth slowdown in Q4 has finally led to the outcome that our estimates the opening up of a negative gap.",
        "In the traditional ways of thinking about monetary policy, this would push the interest rate policy towards being more willing to accommodate.",
        "I prefer to approach monetary policy through the finance angle where the focus is on effectiveness of the transmission policy: Will the interest rate changes have the desired amplifier effects on the economy through the bank and non-bank intermediation sector?",
        "On this front, we have a problem.",
        "A substantial part of the banking sector balance-sheet remains exposed to heavily indebted sectors, a stress that has built up over at least six to seven years.",
        "Accommodation in monetary policy during 2015-16 did not get transmitted to the corporate sector, and private investment remained weak then in spite of the monetary stance.",
        "The Treasury gains accruing to banks in this time, while not a direct concern for the monetary policy, only masked the true stress of their balance-sheets.",
        "In such a scenario, the standard prescription for monetary policy does not necessarily work well.",
        "Tolerance for a slightly higher real rate of interest is justified to ensure weak banks do not find relatively low the hurdle rate for ever-greening (perennial extension) of bad loans.",
        "What is required for monetary policy to do its job better is to address the stress on bank (and highly-indebted borrower) balancesheets.",
        "The Reserve Bank's efforts on this will start in the earnest in a few weeks.",
        "Once the transmission mechanism is restored to better health, monetary policy will more pervasively touch different parts of the economy.",
        "Targeted interventions to stimulate demand for sectors such as construction, where the supply is likely affected as an intended consequence of recent policies, would be more effective for now; this would not run the risks of ever-greening, given the relatively low delinquency rates in bank lending in these segments.",
        "These considerations prevented me from considering a change in stance or recommending a rate cut based on available data, just before the Federal Reserve rate hike and before we had firmly put in place our efforts on resolution of banking sector stress.",
        "I will watch next few months of inflation and real economic activity indicators closely to confirm if lower-than-target headline inflation and negative output gap are persistent.",
        "Finally, I wish to clarify one point.",
        "Some suggest that monetary policy should be eased with the explicit objective of recapitalizing the weak bank balance-sheets.",
        "Nothing could be worse for monetary policy, in my view.",
        "This would relax the pressure on good efforts that are underway deploying a slew of measures to improve the banking architecture (through private capital-raising, non-core asset sales, consolidation, divestment and regulatory prompt corrective action).",
        "In turn, this would trap the monetary policy from changing its direction if data so demand before the resolution of banks is complete.",
        "It is best for sake of policy credibility to not mix instruments with objectives they are not meant to target.",
        "Considering the high uncertainty clouding the near-term inflation outlook, there is a need to avoid premature policy action at this stage.",
        "I, therefore, vote for holding the policy repo rate at the current level of 6.25 per cent and maintaining the neutral stance of monetary policy.",
        "The sharp disinflation in April 2017, coming on the back of firming of inflation in February and March, has imparted considerable uncertainty to the near-term inflation outlook.",
        "Food inflation fell sharply, driven by unusually low momentum in food prices combined with favourable base effects.",
        "Disinflation in services also resulted in moderation in CPI, excluding food and fuel inflation, which had remained sticky through most part of 2016-17.",
        "Incoming data is expected to provide greater clarity on the durability of recent food and non-food disinflation.",
        "There is also a need to be alert to elements that may have a significant influence on the inflation outcome over the medium-term.",
        "Firstly, inflation expectations of households remain elevated despite some recent moderation.",
        "Second, the implementation of 7[th] CPC HRA award is an upside risk.",
        "Third, some increase in MSPs is inevitable.",
        "Last, the rising fiscal risks due to growing demand for farm loan waivers also pose a risk to inflation.",
        "In this context, it may be instructive to note that the outstanding advances to agriculture & allied activities as ratio to GDP from agriculture & allied activities has increased from about 13 percent in 2000-01 to around 53 per cent at present; average annual nominal growth rate in Scheduled Commercial Banks' advances to agriculture & allied activities was 21.5 per cent during 2000-01 to 2016-17.",
        "GVA growth weakened in Q4 of 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in the services sector growth.",

        "The fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on April 5 and 6, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.",
        "The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr.",
        "Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in-charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor.",
        "According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.",
        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters.",
        "The Committee around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent.",
        "Consequent upon the narrowing of the LAF corridor as elaborated in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies, the reverse repo rate under the LAF is at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate are at 6.50 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Since the MPC met in February 2017, indicators of global growth suggest signs of stronger activity in most advanced economies (AEs) and easing of recessionary conditions in commodity exporting large emerging market economies (EMEs).",
        "In the US, high frequency data indicate that the labour market, industrial production and retail sales are catalysing a recovery in Q1 of 2017 from a relatively subdued performance in the preceding quarter.",
        "Nonetheless, risks to higher growth have arisen from non-realisation or under-achievement of macroeconomic policies.",
        "In the Japanese economy, nascent signs of revival are evident in the form of falling unemployment, improving business sentiment on fixed investment, and rising exports helped by the depreciation of the yen; however, deflation risks linger.",
        "For EMEs, the outlook is gradually improving, with indications that the slowdown characterising 2016 could be bottoming out.",
        "In China, supportive macroeconomic policies, surging credit growth and a booming property market have held up the momentum of growth albeit amidst concerns about financial stability and capital outflows.",
        "In Brazil, hardening commodity prices are providing tailwinds to reforms undertaken by the authorities to pull the economy out of recession, although financial fragilities remain a risk.",
        "Russia is benefiting from the firming up of crude prices and it is widely expected that growth will return to positive territory in 2017.",
        "Inflation is edging up in AEs to or above target levels on the back of slowly diminishing slack, tighter labour markets and rising commodity prices.",
        "Among EMEs, Turkey and South Africa remain outliers in an otherwise generalised softening of inflation pressures.",
        "Global trade volumes are finally showing signs of improvement amidst shifts in terms of trade, with exports rising strongly in several EMEs as well as in some AEs whose currencies have depreciated.",
        "11. International financial markets have been impacted by policy announcements in major AEs, geo-political events and country-specific factors.",
        "Equity markets in AEs were driven up by reflation trade, stronger incoming data and currency movements.",
        "Equity markets in EMEs had a mixed performance reflecting domestic factors amidst a cautious return of investor appetite and capital flows.",
        "In the second half of March, dovish guidance on US monetary policy lifted equities across jurisdictions, especially in Asia, as the reach for EME assets resumed strongly, although doubts about the realisation of US policies, Brexit and softer crude prices tempered sentiments.",
        "Bond markets have mirrored the uncertainty surrounding the commitment to fiscal stimulus in the US and yields traded sideways in AEs, while they generally eased across EME currencies initially rose on optimism on the global outlook, but some of them have weakened in recent days with the fall in commodity prices.",
        "Crude prices touched a three-month low in March on rising shale output and US inventories.",
        "Food prices have been firming up globally, driven by cereals.",

        "Agriculture expanded robustly year-on-year after two consecutive years of sub-one per cent growth.",
        "In the industrial sector, there was a significant loss of momentum across all categories, barring electricity generation.",
        "The services sector also slowed, pulled down by trade, hotels, transport and communication as well as financial, real estate and professional services.",
        "Public administration, defence and other services cushioned this slowdown.",
        "To some extent, government expenditure made up for weakness in private consumption and capital formation.",
        "Several indicators are pointing to a modest improvement in the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "Foodgrains production has touched an all-time high of 272 million tonnes, with record production of rice, wheat and pulses.",
        "The record production of wheat should boost procurement operations and economise on imports, which had recently surged.",
        "Rice stocks, which had depleted to close to the minimum buffer norm, have picked up with kharif procurement.",
        "The bumper production of pulses has helped in building up to the intended buffer stock (i.e., 20 lakh tonnes) already fallen below the minimum support price (MSP).",
        "Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), recovered in January from a contraction in the previous month, helped by a broadbased turnaround in manufacturing as well as mining and quarrying.",
        "Capital goods production improved appreciably, although this largely reflected the waning of unfavourable base effects.",
        "Consumer non-durables continued, however, to contract for the second successive month in spite of supportive base effects.",
        "Thus, investment and rural consumption demand remain muted.",
        "The output of core industries moderated in February due to slowdown in production of all the remained in expansion mode in February and rose to a five month high in March on the back of growth of new orders and output.",
        "The future output index also rose strongly on forecasts of pick-up in demand and the launch of new product lines.",
        "The business sentiment is expected to improve in Q1 of 2017-18 on the back of a sharp pick up in both domestic and external demand.",
        "Coincident indicators such as exports and non-oil non-gold imports are indicative of a brighter outlook for industry, although the sizable under-utilisation of capacity in several industries could operate as a drag on investment.",
        "Activity in the services sector appears to be improving as the constraining effects of demonetisation wear off.",
        "On the one hand, rural demand remains depressed as reflected in lower sales of two- and three-wheelers and fertiliser.",
        "On the other hand, high frequency indicators relating to railway traffic, telephone subscribers, foreign tourist arrivals, passenger car and commercial vehicles are regaining pace, thereby positioning the services sector on a rising trajectory.",
        "After three consecutive months of contraction, the services PMI for February and March emerged into the expansion zone on improvement in new business.",
        "After moderating continuously over the last six months to a historic low, retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) turned up in February to 3.7 per cent.",
        "While food prices bottomed out at the preceding meat, fish, milk and processed foods increased, generating a sizable jump in the momentum in the food group.",
        "In the fuel group, inflation increased as the continuous hardening of international prices lifted domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas since July with the programmed reduction of the subsidy.",
        "Adapting to the movements inflation expectations, which had dipped in the December round of the Reserve industrial outlook survey indicates that pricing power is returning to corporates as profit margins get squeezed by input costs.",
        "Excluding food and fuel, inflation moderated in February by 20 basis points to 4.8 per cent, essentially on transient and item-specific factors.",
        "In February, favourable base effects were at work in the clothing and bedding sub-group as well as in personal care and effects, the latter also influenced by the disinflation in gold prices.",
        "The volatility in crude oil prices and its lagged pass-through are impacting the trajectory of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Much of the impact of the fall of US the CPI print in April as its cumulative pass-through occurred with a lag in the first week of this month.",
        "Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has exhibited persistence and has been significantly above headline inflation since September 2016.",
        "With progressive remonetisation, the surplus liquidity in the banking system billion in February and further down to ` 4,806 billion in March.",
        "Currency in circulation expanded steadily during this period.",
        "Its impact on the liquidity overhang was, however, partly offset by a significant decline in cash balances of the Government up to mid-March which released liquidity into the system.",
        "Thereafter, the build-up of Government cash balances on account of advance tax payments and balance sheet adjustment by banks reduced surplus liquidity to ` 3,141 billion by end-March.",
        "Issuances of cash management bills (CMBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) ceased in mid-January and existing issues matured, with the consequent release of liquidity being absorbed primarily through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors.",
        "Accordingly, the average net absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from ` 2,002 billion in January to ` 4,483 billion in March.",
        "The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained within the LAF corridor.",
        "The maturing of CMBs and reduced issuance of Treasury bills leading up to end-March has also contributed to Treasury bill rates being substantially below the policy rate.",
        "Merchandise exports rose strongly in February 2017 from a subdued profile in the preceding months.",
        "Growth impulses were broad-based, with major contributors being engineering goods, petroleum products, iron ore, rice and chemicals.",
        "The surge in imports in January and February 2017 largely reflected the effect of the hardening of commodity prices such as crude oil and coal.",
        "Non-oil non-gold imports continued to grow at a modest pace, though capital goods imports remained sluggish.",
        "With imports outpacing exports, the trade deficit widened in January and February from its level a year ago, though it was lower on a cumulative basis for the period April-February 2016-17.",
        "Balance of payments data for Q3 indicate that the current account deficit for the first three quarters of the financial year narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP, half of its level a year ago.",
        "For the year as a whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted at less than 1 per cent of GDP.",
        "Foreign direct investment (FDI) has dominated net capital inflows during April-December, with manufacturing, communication and financial services being the preferred sectors.",
        "Turbulence in global financial markets set off a bout of global risk aversion and flight to safe haven that caused net outflows of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during November 2016 and improvement in global growth prospects.",
        "FPI flows turned positive in February and welled up into a surge in March, especially in debt markets relative to equity markets (which had been the dominant recipient until February).",
        "This reversal appears to have been driven by stable domestic inflation, better than expected domestic growth, encouraging corporate earnings, clarity on FPI taxation, pro-reform budget proposals and state election results.",
        "The level of foreign exchange reserves 21.",
        "Since the February bi-monthly monetary policy statement, inflation has been quiescent.",
        "Headline CPI inflation is set to undershoot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 in view of the sub-4 per cent readings for January and February.",
        "For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1).",
        "Risks are evenly balanced around the inflation trajectory at the current juncture.",
        "There are upside risks to the baseline projection.",
        "The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the inflation.",
        "Proactive supply management will play a critical role in staving off pressures on headline inflation.",
        "A prominent risk could emanate from managing the implementation of the allowances recommended by the 7[th] CPC.",
        "In case the increase in house rent allowance as recommended by the 7[th] CPC is awarded, it will push up months, with this initial statistical impact on the CPI followed up by second-order effects.",
        "Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST.",
        "The general government deficit, which is high by international comparison, poses yet another risk for the path of inflation, which is likely to be exacerbated by farm loan waivers.",
        "Recent global developments entail a reflation risk which may lift commodity prices further and pass through into domestic inflation.",
        "Moreover, geopolitical risks may induce global financial market volatility with attendant spillovers.",
        "On the downside, international crude prices have been easing recently and their pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products should alleviate pressure on headline inflation.",
        "Also, stepped-up procurement operations in the wake of the record production of foodgrains will rebuild buffer stocks and mitigate food price stress, if it materialises.",
        "GVA growth is projected to strengthen to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 from 6.7 per cent in 2016-17, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",
        "Several favourable domestic factors are expected to drive this acceleration.",
        "First, the pace of remonetisation will continue to trigger a rebound in discretionary consumer spending.",
        "Activity in cash-intensive retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation and unorganised segments has largely been restored.",
        "Second, lending rates post demonetisation should help encourage both consumption and investment demand of healthy corporations.",
        "Third, various proposals in the Union Budget should stimulate capital expenditure, rural demand, and social and physical infrastructure all of which would invigorate economic activity.",
        "Fourth, the imminent materialisation of structural reforms in the form of the roll-out of the GST, the institution of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will boost investor confidence and bring in efficiency gains.",
        "Fifth, the upsurge in initial public offerings in the primary capital market augurs well for investment and growth.",
        "The global environment is improving, with global output and trade projected by multilateral agencies to gather momentum in 2017.",
        "Accordingly, external demand should support domestic growth.",
        "Downside risks to the projected growth path stem from the outturn of the south west monsoon; ebbing consumer optimism on the outlook for income, the general economic situation and employment as polled in the commodity prices, other than crude, hardening further.",
        "transitory effects of demonetisation has been broadly borne out.",
        "While these effects are still playing out, they are distinctly on the wane and should fade away by the Q4 of 2016-17.",
        "While inflation has ticked up in its latest reading, its path through 2017-18 appears uneven and challenged by upside risks and unfavourable base effects towards the second half of the year.",
        "Moreover, underlying inflation pressures persist, especially in prices of services.",
        "Input cost pressures are gradually bringing back pricing power to enterprises as demand conditions improve The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner.",
        "Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored.",
        "At the same time, the output gap is gradually closing.",
        "Consequently, aggregate demand pressures could build up, with implications for the inflation trajectory.",
        "Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in this review while persevering with a neutral stance.",
        "The future course of monetary policy will largely depend on incoming data on how macroeconomic conditions are evolving.",
        "Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete transmission of policy impulses remains, including for small savings/administered rates[1].",
        "It is in this context that greater clarity about liquidity management is being provided, even as surplus liquidity is being steadily drained out.",
        "conditions for bank credit to revive and flow to productive sectors of the economy.",
        "Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision.",
        "The minutes of 29.",
        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on June 6 and 7, 2017.",
        "Core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) continues to be sticky, and its persistence poses upside risks for meeting the medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent.",
        "Other exclusion based measures also remain elevated, although there have been transient declines in the demonetisation period.",
        "There has also been an inching up in the median 3 month and 1 year ahead inflationary expectations.",
        "The recent decline in headline inflation has been driven completely by food inflation and is likely to reverse in the summer months.",
        "A strong upside risk to the inflation trajectory is the HRA implementation of the 7[th] Pay Commission.",
        "This needs to be watched carefully in terms of (i) to what extent higher, depending on tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed.",
        "If the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide, the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full t i i t b k l di t the increase in the centre HRA is matched by state HRAs; and (ii) the extent to which the centre and state HRAs are implemented simultaneously (which means the inflationary effects will be stronger) or is staggered (which means the inflationary effect will be weaker).",
        "While we should see through any statistical effects from an increase in the HRA, the size of the second round effects may potentially be large depending on the extent and manner in which the HRA implementation takes place, in which case, there may be a need for a monetary policy response.",
        "Our focus on meeting the medium-term inflation target should remain laser sharp in light of such risks.",
        "impact of demonetisation on the real economy has been transient.",
        "Importantly, the PMI in services has come out of contraction mode.",
        "The impact of demonetisation on the strategic timing of the MSP helping in this regard.",
        "The performance of the real estate sector listed companies has seen an improvement.",
        "Large and medium industries have also recovered handsomely in terms of demand after demonetisation, although the small and micro sectors continue to be adversely affected.",
        "Overall, the output gap, while marginally negative, is closing gradually leading to the possible building up of inflationary pressures 33.",
        "As I mentioned in the last review, the pace of the ending of the re-investment of principal payments by the US Fed from its balance sheet holdings needs to be the Fed, as well as rises in the Fed funds rate, are disruptive for financial markets.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for keeping the policy repo Committee.",
        "Several factors indicate positive and modest growth in the economy.",
        "The remonetisation drive is progressing well, with the currency in circulation restored to almost 75 per cent of its value by end March of this year, which is expected to support discretionary spending.",
        "Spending in cash-intensive activities such as hotels, restaurants, transportation and the unorganised sectors is also on the rise.",
        "Further, a decrease in bank lending rates due to a delayed transmission of policy rate reductions in the past augurs well for the economy and may enhance consumption and investment spending.",
        "Various measures outlined in the Union Budget 2017-18 are conducive to growth in key sectors including the rural economy, infrastructure and housing, and are expected to have multiplier effects.",
        "The March 2017 round of the Industrial Outlook Survey undertaken by the Reserve Bank also shows improvement in sentiment in the corporate sector.",
        "On the external front, positive signs of growth across Advanced and Emerging Market Economies may boost demand for Indian exports.",
        "This optimism regarding domestic and global economic growth is also reflected in the leading indexes compiled by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York.",
        "On the inflation front, CPI inflation remained soft, primarily due to lower food prices, as vegetable prices declined, possibly due to distress sales as a result of demonetisation.",
        "However, core inflation (excluding food and fuel) continues to be higher, although it moderated slightly to 4.8 per cent in February.",
        "At the same time, upside risks to inflation remain, including remonetisation, rising rural wages, rollout of GST, possibility of _El Nino conditions, higher global commodity prices,_ uncertainty regarding prices of crude oil and exchange rate volatility.",
        "A Survey of Households Inflation Expectations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in March 2017 also indicates a rise in 3-month and 1-year ahead inflation expectations.",
        "indicates some firming in inflation pressures.",
        "The effects of demonetisation on the Indian economy so far have turned out to be transitory and of lower magnitude vindicating our stand earlier.",
        "There are indications of a modest improvement in the domestic macroeconomic performance.",
        "The global outlook for growth, trade and prices has also improved.",
        "It is likely to have a favourable impact on Indian exports and the economy.",
        "The manufacturing sentiments on both the domestic and external demand.",
        "However, the capacity utilisation in industries has remained persistently low indicating at least continuing, if not widening, output gap.",
        "Against this, the headline inflation has been substantially below 4 per cent largely on account of vegetables and pulses.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel (core inflation) has been fairly sticky though has marginally declined to 4.8 per cent in February.",
        "Surplus liquidity in the economy since January 2017 has been steadily declining from ` 8 trillion to ` 4.8 trillion in March 2017.",
        "The core inflation according to my calculations is likely to show a declining trend over the year.",
        "Moreover, the dynamics of pass-through from the non-core to the core inflation is changing such that volatility in the food/fuel prices would penetrate into core less easily than before.",
        "Oil prices according to me are not expected to stay high consistently.",
        "Simultaneous implementation of house rent allowances recommended by the 7[th] CPC by the Centre and all State governments is less likely and consequently its impact on inflation during 2017-18 may not be as high as 1 to 1.5 percentage points.",
        "The rising probability of _El Nino event around July-_ August may adversely affect food production but may not seriously impact the food prices in view of comfortable buffer stocks.",
        "The GST implementation may not substantially impact the headline inflation because of multi-tier rate system.",
        "In view of all this, the inflation projection according to my calculations is an average of around 4 per cent for the first half of 2017-18 and around 4.5 per cent for the second half of the year.",
        "Given the surplus liquidity still floating in the system, any change in the policy rate is not desirable at this stage.",
        "The liquidity position is expected to return to the normal level consistent with the neutral stance soon.",
        "True to projections made at the time of the last meeting of the Committee, inflation is turning up.",
        "It seems to me that it is coming out of the U-shaped compression imposed by demonetisation and is now positioned on the rising slope.",
        "Several factors merit pre-emptive concern.",
        "When inflation rears its ugly head in these items, experience suggests it is likely to stay.",
        "Second, inflation excluding food and fuel has been unrelenting.",
        "It is only in the February reading that there is a small downward movement, but is it sustainable?",
        "I think not: it is item-specific rather than generalised.",
        "If staff's projections are indicative, inflation excluding food and fuel will probably run ahead of headline inflation throughout 2017-18.",
        "The consequence of the firming up of these salient prices is that inflation expectations have reversed and hardened, and not just in the near term but also a year ahead and across all product groups.",
        "Consumer confidence in the price situation has deteriorated.",
        "Firms are regaining pricing power.",
        "Third, high frequency indicators may be indicating that demonetisation affected actual output rather than potential.",
        "With remonetisation, therefore, the output inflation in the months ahead.",
        "These developments suggest to me that momentum is gathering underneath inflation developments, which appear benign at this juncture.",
        "In the second half of 2017-18, favourable base effects fade, and if food inflation rises alongside the stickiness in underlying inflation, it could become a perfect storm.",
        "So much for the ingredients of inflation.",
        "Let me turn to costs.",
        "The most important cost push will emanate from the 7[th] pay commission's house rent allowance.",
        "The first order statistical impact on the CPI may take headline inflation to or beyond the upper tolerance band.",
        "Second order effects will work universities, and onwards.",
        "These effects will occur on top of the first order effect and 6 per cent plus inflation could be here to stay for some time.",
        "The second one is the one off effect of the GST - small relative to the 7[th] pay commission and short lived, it could still last a year and push up inflation.",
        "Finally, let me turn to the elephants in the room, keeping in mind that whether elephants fight or play, the grass suffers.",
        "event is rising and if food inflation gets entrenched as it did in 2009 in the trail of a sub-normal monsoon, there will be second order effects.",
        "The second one is imported inflation, including through bouts of financial market turbulence and the rising tide of protectionism.",
        "and it cannot be that India will be immune to it.",
        "Normalisation of monetary policy has begun in those economies, and it is not just the raising of policy rates/short-term rates.",
        "Normalising overly distended balance sheets can produce tightening of longer rates as well.",
        "To sum up, I believe that a pre-emptive 25 basis points increase in the policy rate now will point us better at the target of 4 per cent to which the Committee has committed explicitly.",
        "It will also obviate the need for back-loaded policy action later when inflation is unacceptably high and entrenched.",
        "On balance, however, I vote for holding the policy rate unchanged in this bi-monthly meeting and await a few more readings of incoming data so that remaining transitory factors have passed and a clearer assessment of domestic and global macroeconomic conditions emerges.",
        "Headline inflation is set to rebound from its recent lows due to the expected (and in the past month, realized) mean-reversion in food inflation, especially in vegetables.",
        "Global inflationary trends have remained on the upside too.",

        "Inflation expectations of households surveyed by the Reserve Bank have already firmed up and any increase in food and fuel prices may further harden these expectations.",

        "Various factors however bode well for the growth process (GST, favourable impact of global growth, incipient turn around in credit growth, pay commission, and bank recapitalization).",
        "More certainty on growth trends will be available in the next couple of months after the release of Advance GDP Estimates and the Union Budget, making it prudent to wait and watch.",

        "Inflation as measured by the CPI recorded an uptick since the previous meeting of the MPC in early October 2017.",
        "This rise was driven by higher food inflation (mainly vegetables and fruits) and fuel prices.",

        "I am not in agreement with the assessment of the RBI for both the CPI inflation and the economic growth prospects in the near term.",
        "I also do not share its over-concerns for the upside risks on inflation and over-optimism on economic growth front.",
        "In my opinion, the inflation situation is under reasonable control and is likely to remain well within the acceptable range during the foreseeable future because after a couple of months favourable base effects will set in.",
        "The real cause of concern right now is the economic recovery and its slow pace.",
        "Fiscal space is more or less exhausted but the space for the monetary boost has fortunately been available now for a relatively long period.",
        "Had the policy rate been cut to 5.75 per cent in June 2017 as I had argued then, the economic recovery would have been far more rapid and we would have been in a much better position.",
        "Although we have missed the bus, it is still better late than never.",
        "In my opinion, we must cut the policy rate by at least 25 basis points to begin with if we want to be on conservative side, because enough space existed all along.",
        "The specific reasons for my recommendation are as follows: shows an increase of about 60 basis points (bps) for inflation one year ahead, overall it shows a substantial decline of about 280 bps over the last year or so.",
        "A very consistent and more reliable result is obtained from the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) latest business expectation survey with more than 2100 responses well below the RBI target of 4 per cent.",
        "The standard deviation for this estimate is also relatively low.",
        "Thus, inflationary expectations are very well anchored and inflation control does not seem to be a major issue in the near future, i.e.",
        "over next 6 to 12 months.",
        "ii) On the other hand, the RBI surveys show that consumer confidence on income, employment and overall economic environment is very low and declining in recent times.",
        "Companies still lack the pricing power and experience squeeze in their profit margins.",
        "iii) Better performing and financially sound companies according to the RBI surveys are investing more in financial assets than in physical assets.",
        "They behave more like savers than investors because the real rate of interest is too high to encourage long term investment.",
        "Even consumers would be discouraged to consume durable goods.",
        "It needs to be noted that the real rate of interest is the difference between nominal rate of interest and expected rate of inflation (and not the observed rate of inflation in the recent past).",
        "iv) Despite the marginal economic recovery, the capacity utilization in Indian industry according to the RBI surveys continues to be at low level of 72 per cent indicating persistent existence of output gap.",
        "Service sector PMI is also declining and in the pessimist zone.",
        "v) The growth recovery expectation of RBI during the June-September quarter of 2017 cent, the growth of real GVA during the quarter turned out to be only 6.1 per cent.",
        "Yet, the RBI has not revised its growth forecast from the earlier 6.7 percent for the year 2017-18.",
        "This implies that RBI now expects a higher growth of 7.0 and 7.8 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of 2017-18.",
        "This is highly improbable to be achieved without any policy rate cut because fiscal space is practically non-existent and the conditions described in points (ii) to (iv) above are posing a big challenge.",
        "Expecting an unrealistically higher growth rates during the 3[rd] and 4[th] quarters creates a false hope of the output gap closing on its own in near future so as to continue with the policy inaction.",
        "vi) On the contrary, since the recovery has been slow and the confidence low, I expect the growth during the year 2017-18 to be much lower at only 6.4 per cent, which implies a growth rate of 6.7 and 7.2 per cent respectively for the 3[rd] and 4[th] quarters.",
        "Moreover, unlike my colleagues on the MPC, I firmly believe that the output gap would not start my opinion, the output gap is going to expand till the middle of the next year.",
        "That, in itself, will put downward pressure on prices and neutralize several upside risks to inflation.",
        "Oil prices in my opinion are not likely to stay significantly higher than the current level for any longer time.",
        "Similarly, although the fiscal slippage is likely in percentage to GDP, it would not be substantial in absolute terms.",
        "The fiscal deficit as percentage of GDP may exceed the target because the nominal GDP would grow much slower than the assumed number (11.75 per cent) in the last budget on account of lower inflation and substantial slowdown in the real growth.",
        "However, the numerator that puts upward pressure on yield rates and prices is not likely to increase substantially in absolute terms and hence the inflationary impact would be limited.",
        "the remaining two quarters of 2017-18 is in the range of 4.3 to 4.7 per cent.",
        "If we exclude the pure statistical effect of revisions in the house rent allowance by the 7th Pay Commission for the government employees, the range of the RBI forecasts of both the headline and CPI excluding food and fuel show the relevant inflation rate hovering around 3.9 to 4.3 per cent over the rest of the year.",
        "Thus, there is a clear space for the rate reduction of at least 25 bps even without considering the output gap.",
        "viii) There are serious implications of keeping the real policy rate substantially higher than most other countries in the world.",
        "Currently, only eleven countries in the world have a positive real policy rate and several of them either are in some crisis or have recently emerged out of a crisis.",
        "Among the rest of the countries, India has the highest real rate.",
        "If the situation is not corrected soon, it has the potential to destabilize the financial markets at home by discouraging domestic investments and encouraging foreign investment in the debt market.",
        "It may involve substantial risks for future.",
        "On the other hand, by cutting the policy rate, the domestic corporate bond market, stock market and hence investment demand could be encouraged and growth can be accelerated to bridge the output gap.",
        "Keeping all these points in mind, I vote for a 25 bps cut in the policy rate in December 2017.",
        "I vote for status quo.",
        "All the upside risks to inflation cited in previous resolutions are materialising.",
        "Moreover, price pressures are no more confined to vegetables alone, as in previous readings; they are getting diffused across petroleum products, services (excluding housing, which is being pulled up independently by statistical effects of the house rent allowance for central government employees), and into underlying inflation.",
        "The risks of inflation getting generalised appear to have increased to a point where they could potentially overwhelm the softening effects of winter arrivals of vegetables and fruits.",
        "Projections indicate that inflation prints are likely to stay above target from here on.",
        "The pressure of input costs may soon force corporations to reflect them in selling prices as their margins get whittled down from absorbing these costs.",
        "Financial markets, especially the bond market segment, are scenting higher inflation in the air.",
        "The slosh of liquidity that marooned markets during the year so far is being steadily drained away by liquidity operations and a position of neutrality may emerge before the end of the financial year, abstracting maturing securities under the market stabilisation scheme and forex operations.",
        "policy rate by 200 basis points - is one of the deepest barring the easing associated with the global financial crisis.",
        "Also, it has been more fully transmitted.",
        "In my view, this phase has matured; it is time now to signal its end and commence the withdrawal of accommodation, consistent with the evolving stance of liquidity management.",
        "It is not that I am sanguine about growth; far from it.",
        "Rather than green shoots, my sense is that the upturn of Q2 occurred on the back of replenishment of inventories, and more incoming data are needed to tell us whether or not it is durable.",
        "The investment temper remains dormant, as evident in the persisting slump in the rate of capital formation.",
        "It awaits reforms that bite the bullet in terms of freeing up product and factor markets, removing barriers to entry and exit, and rekindling productivity and competitiveness all around.",
        "As growth regains solid ground, it could likely sustain inflation above the target.",
        "The time has come for monetary policy to take guard and be ready to go on to the front foot.",
        "The global commodity cycle now seems to have turned with oil prices having also rebounded recently.",
        "This has created significant input cost pressures in the economy, which at some stage may get passed on to retail prices.",
        "Vegetable prices have also firmed up, creating uncertainty around the extent of seasonal winter moderation in prices.",
        "These factors have put headline inflation on a trajectory that will most likely cross the MPC target rate of 4 per cent rather soon and remain above the target in the medium term (even after excluding the HRA impact).",
        "Oil price evolution remains a particular concern.",
        "The shale gas response notwithstanding, improving global demand appears to be playing an important role in shaping balancing elsewhere, whereas lack of such adjustment would imply pressure on domestic inflation (temporarily latent, since the price pass-through at pumps has not been immediate).",
        "The adverse change in overall terms of trade given the commodity cycle upturn has likely also weakened drivers of growth.",
        "Nevertheless, there has been some respite in the last attributable in part to improved credit growth and overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector.",
        "Output gap remains somewhat negative as reflected in present low capacity utilisation and high inventory.",
        "However, gradually improving credit metrics in several distressed sectors should pave way for improved investment over the next year.",
        "This process is expected to be further supported as cases referenced to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) resolve, facilitate consolidation, and restore pricing power.",
        "As public sector banks raise capital, receive recapitalisation from the government, and undertake reforms, credit flows to productive sectors of the economy should improve.",
        "There seems little scope for accommodation or for change of stance at the present juncture.",
        "Hence, I vote to keep the repo rate at 6 per cent with neutral stance.",
        "Incoming data will be key to shape the policy going forward.",
        "I remain keen to (i) understand the impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on price levels as its rollout stabilises; (ii) assess in coming months the robustness of growth revival in GVA manufacturing; and (iii) track the impact of commodity prices on the Indian economy and markets.",
        "In parallel, the Reserve Bank is examining options to improve the transmission of its policy rate actions from banks to borrowers.",
        "The inflation scenario has evolved by and large along anticipated lines even as there was some unexpected firming up of food prices in October.",
        "(I say by and large because prints have been volatile throughout the year.)",
        "Inflation is now projected to be marginally higher, going forward, as the recent increase in oil prices is likely to sustain.",
        "Food inflation, led by vegetables, remains highly variable, while deflation in pulses continues.",
        "The impact of higher house rent allowance (HRA) of central government employees on housing inflation will peak in December.",
        "There are several risks to the projected inflation trajectory.",
        "First, inflation expectations of households for both three-month ahead and one-year ahead periods in the latest round of rise at a faster rate than the current level was the highest since end-2013.",
        "Second, rising input cost pressures across the board for both manufacturing and services have raised the risk of pass-through to output prices, especially because the growth momentum is projected to gain strength in the second half of the year.",
        "Third, fiscal slippage concerns linger on.",
        "Should this risk materialise, it would have implications for the inflation outlook.",
        "These risks to the inflation trajectory could, however, be alleviated to some extent by the expected seasonal moderation in vegetable prices and the pass-through of recent reduction in GST rates on certain goods and services to retail prices.",
        "The acceleration in GVA growth in Q2:2017-18 (as projected in October) is comforting, especially because it was underpinned by a sharp increase in manufacturing.",
        "Growth in gross capital formation continued to recover.",
        "Going forward, lower _rabi sowing_ and lower reservoir level pose a downside risk to agriculture activity.",
        "However, on the manufacturing sector business expectations in Q3.",
        "Various indicators of service sector activity, however, present a mixed picture.",
        "Financial conditions have improved significantly in the recent period as reflected in large capital raised from the primary capital market and a pick-up in bank credit growth.",
        "These perhaps may be indicating a long-awaited (modest) upturn in an investment cycle.",
        "The macroeconomic situation has remained broadly unchanged since the last MPC meeting in October 2017.",
        "However, the recent upturn in crude oil prices has emerged as a source of concern.",
        "Several uncertainties, especially on the fiscal and external fronts, persist.",
        "It is, therefore, important to be vigilant.",
        "Hence, I vote for _status quo in the policy rate, while_ maintaining the stance as neutral; this allows us the flexibility to respond appropriately to incoming data."

        "In light of the benign inflation outlook and a moderation in inflation expectations, as well as the likely headwinds due to the global growth slowdown, I vote for decreasing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and changing the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral.",
        "In the MPC meeting of December 2018, I had argued that given the sudden favourable changes in the macroeconomic environment during November 2018 and their magnitude, it was the most opportune time for the MPC to cut the policy rate.",
        "However, because the MPC had insistently changed its stance from neutral to calibrated tightening with a 5:1 majority vote only in the previous meeting of October stating explicitly that any rate cuts were off the table, it would not be appropriate to cut the rate in the December 2018 policy.",
        "My strong plea to change the stance to neutral was also not accepted by my other colleagues in the MPC, though it was made clear in the subsequent communication that in future the MPC could consider a rate cut if the upside risk to inflation did not materialize.",
        "The subsequent two prints of monthly CPI headline inflation for November and December 2018, which are now available, confirm that the coming down further.",
        "On the other hand, there are concerns about the GDP growth slowing would be appropriate to consider a rate cut not only to correct the past inaction but also provide impetus to growth without materially risking inflation beyond the targeted 4 percent.",
        "Under these circumstances, I think space has opened up for a substantial rate cut of about 50 to 60 bps going forward.",
        "There is, therefore, an immediate need to change the stance formally from calibrated tightening to neutral and cut the policy rate by 25 bps to begin with.",
        "More specific reasons for my vote are as follows: i) The implicit volatility in the oil prices was unusually high during November 2018, but now, during December 2018 and particularly January 2019, has significantly come down to almost its long-term average.",
        "There is an expectation of oil prices stabilizing at current basis have substantially receded.",
        "exercise of forecast undertaken by the RBI staff in consultation with the subject matter experts.",
        "iii) Inflation ex-food and fuel is also predicted to fall from its current level of about 5.9 percent in Q3 of 2018-19 to about 5.1 percent in Q3 of 2019-20.",
        "It may fall even more if the current spike in health and education price index turns out to be only one off phenomenon.",
        "Thus, the core (or ex-food and fuel) inflation also shows a declining trend.",
        "This is quite consistent with the finding of my study with a co-author published in EPW inflationary expectations and as a result the core inflation is also declining.",
        "iv) As a result of all this, the headline inflation forecast one year ahead by RBI staff has turned out to be less than the target of 4 percent for the first time.",
        "With the policy rate of 6.5 percent, this implies the real policy rate of about 2.6 percent, which is one of the highest in the world as I have been arguing.",
        "We do not need such a high real policy rate.",
        "It only discourages private investment and impedes growth and employment.",
        "There is an urgent need to correct the situation by bringing down the real policy rate to a more ahead is within the target of 4 percent.",
        "v) It is important to note that the inflationary expectations in the economy have also been falling now at least for the last three survey rounds.",
        "Median household inflationary expectations 3 and 12 months ahead in the RBI surveys have shown considerable decline of about 120 and 130 bps and business expectations of headline CPI inflation 12 months ahead in the IIMA surveys have shown 53 bps decline.",
        "Moreover, the absolute number in the latter is 3.8 percent, which is almost the same as the RBI forecast.",
        "This provides more comfort for our quantitative assessment going forward.",
        "vi) Recently announced budget of the Central Government shows no fiscal slippage from the path of fiscal and debt consolidation during 2018-19 when we consider the first revised estimates of GDP published on 31st January 2019.",
        "The slippage during 2019-20 without additional resource mobilization (since it was an interim budget) also turns out to be less than 20 bps from the fiscal consolidation path.",
        "In all probability, in the regular budget to be presented after the general election, such a minor gap may be covered with additional resource mobilization.",
        "It may not, therefore, have any significant inflationary impact on the economy and a very limited impact on the real interest rates in the system.",
        "With the institutional reforms in the recent past, significant fiscal slippage from the states side taking place is also not very likely.",
        "vii) With the latest revisions in the GDP and unemployment estimates over the recent past there is a need to have a serious relook at the estimates of potential output and potential output growth in the economy.",
        "My views expressed earlier on the issue and estimates given by renowned scholars with rich policy making experience in the country need to be considered seriously.",
        "Accordingly, the potential output growth for the Indian economy going forward seems to be in the range of 8 to 8.5 percent and not 7 to 7.5 percent as was implicitly assumed now for quite some time.",
        "If we consider this more plausible estimate, the output gap is widening rather than closing.",
        "Generally, as the economic policy reforms are implemented, the potential output growth rises because it opens up new opportunities growth forecast for the next 3 4 quarters, therefore, suggests that a substantial output gap is likely to open up exercising downward pressure on wage growth and inflation.",
        "viii) The experience of this MPC corroborates a negative correlation between the real policy rate (as measured by the excess of the actual policy rate over the projected inflation one year ahead at the time of the policy announcement) and the real GDP growth.",
        "One cannot reject the hypothesis that the recent slowdown in the real GDP growth in India is on account of high real policy rates among other factors.",
        "If so, now is the ripe time to correct the real interest rates and create policy space for future actions if required.",
        "Given all these reasons, in my view this is the time to act decisively by changing the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral and cutting the policy rate by 25 bps to begin with.",
        "The future rate actions may be data driven particularly with respect to the target of 4 percent headline inflation sustaining over time and the direction and magnitude of output gap.",
        "My sense from recent readings is that inflation is troughing and its path over the 12 months ahead horizon is likely to be one that rises from current lows.",
        "Given that inflation excluding food and fuel is elevated but sticky (fuel inflation is easing and its weight in the CPI is small relatively speaking), the future trajectory of headline inflation will be determined essentially by the momentum of food price changes, especially in the first half of 2019-20 when typically, there is a pre-monsoon firming up.",
        "The critical judgment call is: will the momentum of food prices revert to the typical pattern from the unusually subdued pace observed in 2018-19 (April-August), or, will it take some time for large excess supplies in several food items to balance out before the usual momentum takes hold?",
        "My sense is the latter, given that the prices of some items like pulses and sugar are sluggishly emerging out of a deep cyclical downswing, while those of oils and fats are muted by the turning down of international commodity prices, and other prices such as those of fruits, vegetables and milk are experiencing irregular and unusual softness.",
        "The outlook for cereal prices has also turned benign, with prospects of drawing down of sizable excess buffer stocks in the months ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, outside the food group, upside risks to the headline inflation path from crude prices have also ebbed considerably and the recent upsurges in prices of education and health could possibly be short-lived.",
        "In an inflation targeting framework, the forecast becomes the intermediate target because are invisible.",
        "The forecast indicates that headline inflation is likely to course below 4 per cent up to the third quarter of 2019-20, thus securing the target over a one-year ahead time horizon.",
        "surveyed households, businesses and professional forecasters have made sizable corrections in their inflation expectations over the next twelve months; consumers are more sanguine about the evolving price situation than before; and cost pressures are moderate with delayed and incomplete pass-through to selling prices.",
        "The key insight is provided by the direction of these adjustments, not their levels.",
        "achieved on a reasonably lasting basis, it opens up some headroom to address the objective of growth.",
        "The MPC will need to closely monitor the evolution of these disparately driven price movements and calibrate the monetary policy stance accordingly.",
        "If the momentum of food price changes in the next few months indicates that inflation is likely to rise above 4 per cent and persist in the upper reaches of the tolerance band, pre-emptive action will be warranted to ensure that the primary objective of maintaining price stability is defended and achieved lastingly.",
        "Turning to the outlook for growth, domestic activity remains resilient, but it appears to be shedding some speed in the second half of 2018-19.",
        "Dark clouds seem to be gathering over the horizon.",
        "High frequency indicators suggest that the pick-up in investment in the first half of 2018-19 may have lost some strength in the second half and considerable uncertainty shrouds the capacity utilisation in manufacturing is straining above trend in view of the still weak capex cycle.",
        "weakening of global growth in the second half of 2018 may prolong into coming quarters; global trade and investment may be impacted by ongoing trade tensions; and tail risks from policy uncertainties in systemically important economies may crystallise.",
        "Should a deeper than currently anticipated global slowdown take hold, domestic activity could be dragged down by retarding impulses transmitted through the channels of exports and investment.",
        "In this scenario, it is prudent to preserve sufficient policy space to insulate the economy from adverse external shocks and boost the domestic economy in an opportune manner rather than deplete it in haste.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for a 25 basis points reduction in the policy rate and a pre-emptive shift to a neutral policy stance.",
        "Since the December monetary policy meeting, food inflation prints have continued to be soft, mainly due to vegetables and fruits witnessing healthy domestic production combined with imports (in some cases).",
        "In fact, several food groups are now in deflation, continuing with the momentum of recent food inflation prints that were available at the time of the December policy.",
        "Fuel inflation has eased due to a drop in international Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices.",
        "Headline inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated somewhat due to a fall in crude oil past three prints, with inflation in health and education components showing a spike in December due to unexpected rise in prices of medicines and private tuition costs.",
        "The RBI headline inflation projections were already revised substantially downward from projection horizon.",
        "The additional downside surprise relative to December projections has been small, around 10 bps on a quarterly basis.",
        "Inflation expectations of households as measured by horizon, possibly reflecting the adaptive nature of household expectations in response to the softness of recent inflation prints; importantly, they too indirectly confirm the ground reality and revision in inflation perceptions, especially in food and fuel categories.",
        "the next 12 month horizon have been further revised downward and imply headline inflation steadily rising but remaining below the target rate of 4%.",
        "My understanding of composition effects and risks around these projections is as follows: 64.",
        "One, inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated and persistent, so it seems crucial to understand if the sharp increase in momentum observed in health and education components is one-off or not.",
        "While it seems reasonable to treat it as one-off for now, if it does sustain then it could push inflation excluding food and fuel into uncomfortable territory.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no decisive way to resolve this issue other than to wait for and analyse a few more prints.",
        "Second, international Brent crude prices have stabilised in the short run.",
        "Nevertheless, it is too early to forget or rule out the wild gyrations from geopolitical risks, as were observed over the past six months.",
        "Given our oil imports and the implied current account deficit effects, headline inflation responds particularly adversely to upside risk from crude oil prices.",
        "Third, the recent low momentum in food prices is assumed to have a structural component over the next 12-month horizon as there appears to be a supply glut in several food items at both domestic and international levels.",
        "Vegetable prices, however, are vulnerable to sudden reversal from their deflationary momentum.",
        "More importantly, the assumption of sustained low momentum in food prices leads to a consideration of the risk of agrarian distress.",
        "Such distress will necessitate a political-economy response in the form of fiscal support to the agrarian economy in the short run; effects of such fiscal support may play out partly over the next 12 months and partly beyond.",
        "Besides stimulating rural demand and restoring rural wages, such a response could get generalised into headline inflation; this could arise, for example, by aggravating the input cost push arising in the financing of the real economy from fiscal and quasi-fiscal financing, especially from national small savings fund (NSSF) into bank deposit rates and from fiscal/quasi-fiscal market borrowings into corporate bond yields.",
        "Our counterfactual exercises suggest that such upward pressure on headline inflation would require commensurate policy rate action over the next 12 months.",
        "In other words, the assumption of particularly benign food inflation in the short run imparts significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, at the short- and/or medium-term horizons, from the fiscal adjustments that would be necessary to address resulting agrarian distress and to boost rural demand.",
        "Fourth, while inflation expectations have moved downward in the most recent survey, when compared to the December 2017 survey, they remain higher at 3-month horizon.",
        "In other words, anchoring of inflation expectations of households is still an ongoing process and it is somewhat early to assume its sustenance going forward based on the most recent adjustment.",
        "On balance, I remain concerned about (i) the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel; (ii) upward risks that could emanate from oil prices and fiscal implications of sustained food deflation; and, (iii) lack of adequate and sustained downward adjustment in household inflation expectations over the past 12 months.",
        "Turning to growth, concerns around global growth, especially in major advanced economies and emerging markets embroiled in tariff wars, have gathered momentum.",
        "In response, several central banks have decided to be patient with their rate hike plans and/or have revised growth projections downwards.",
        "My assessment is that unless these concerns turn into recessionary risks, they could in fact be positive for the Indian economy as a reduction in aggregate global demand keeps Brent crude oil prices under check.",
        "performance in Q3 of 2018 19 was stable; capacity utilisation absolute or seasonally adjusted has remained robust and close to or above 75 for past two quarters; PMI manufacturing and services continue to remain in expansion mode at healthy levels; and consumer sentiment surveyed by the RBI has improved.",
        "The primary weak coincident economic indicators have been auto sales and production.",
        "Our internal research suggests that this weakness reflects in part the lagged impact of high fuel prices during Q2 and part of Q3 of 2018-19, an effect that should gradually reverse, as well as due to one-off policy changes such as in emission standards and third-party insurance requirement.",
        "Traditional measures of the output gap suggest some opening up, i.e., realised output below the potential output; however, my preferred measure, the finance-neutral output gap, remains positive, i.e., realised output is slightly above the potential output, as it captures the healthy aggregate credit growth and stable stock market performance.",
        "This is also consistent with the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Combining my inflation and growth assessments, and given the Monetary Policy future dates based on incoming data, but to hold the policy rate at 6.5%.",
        "Given the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel, our counterfactual exercises do not suggest any room for over the medium term.",
        "In my view, a rate cut decision now would be heavily dependent on the assumption of sustained weak momentum of food prices all through the next 12 months, which, as I explained, must be viewed as coincident with significant upside risk from fiscal measures needed to address agrarian distress.",
        "It seems better to me, in times of presently healthy levels of growth, to wait till the next policy by when uncertainties I have highlighted, especially around one-off surprises in health and education inflation, oil prices, and global recessionary risks, could resolve.",
        "The growth print for Q3 would also be available by then for understanding any soft spots in the domestic real economy and their drivers.",
        "Finally, recall that I did vote for a rate cut in August 2017; at that point of time, all components of inflation had experienced downward trends, upside risks to inflation had reduced, and growth was weaker.",
        "That constellation of parameters gave me greater comfort to cut the policy rate than at the present juncture.",
        "Should a similar situation evolve in the next two months, I would have greater clarity for future policy action.",
        "The CPI inflation print of December at 2.2 per cent continued to surprise on the downside.",
        "The overall food group continued to remain in deflation with the decline in food significantly mainly due to a sharp decline in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel also moderated, dragged down mainly by the decline in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices.",
        "Housing inflation continued to edge down.",
        "However, inflation in household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education firmed up in December 2018. excess domestic supply conditions in many food items.",
        "The lower prices in the international markets in food items also limit the avenues for exports to address the domestic surplus.",
        "This will be an important factor in keeping the overall inflation low.",
        "Soft crude oil prices augur well for keeping the petroleum product inflation under check and this will help in containing the input costs for goods and services.",
        "Inflation expectations of households have declined significantly in the last round, which is a welcome development.",
        "CPI inflation is projected at below four per cent is a need to guard against some uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook such as (i) abrupt reversal in vegetable prices; (ii) haziness in the oil price outlook; (iii) the recent unusual spike in the prices of health and education, which calls for vigilance; and (iv) the impact of several budget proposals on the aggregate demand, though the full effect of the measures will materialise over a period of time.",
        "Looking further ahead, there are signs of domestic growth slowing down indicators point to investment demand losing some traction, with production of capital goods and import of capital goods contracting in recent months.",
        "High frequency indicators also suggest moderation in demand (passenger cars, consumer durables, motorcycles and tractor sales).",
        "On the supply side, rabi sowing so far has been marginally lower than the previous year, with shortfall across crops.",

        "As anticipated by the MPC, inflation turned up in February 2019, lifted by food prices emerging out of five months of deflation.",
        "Three features of the upturn are noteworthy.",
        "First, the January and February readings of inflation that became available after the MPC met last in February have undershot the projection made in that meeting.",
        "It is reasonable to expect that the March reading - that will become available on April 12 - may reveal that food prices are out of deflation, but headline inflation is still softer than the February meeting projection.",
        "I belabour this point because it informs the error correction process that is concurrently taking place.",
        "Second, the entire inflation projection path of the MPC's April 2019 meeting has important in a forward-looking sense because as intermediate variables that provide a first glimpse of monetary policy's unseen and moving targets, the projections are indicating that likely remain at or below target over the 12-month horizon for which forecasts are available.",
        "Third, the one year ahead projection of inflation seems to be validated by incoming data.",
        "Survey results indicate that households, businesses and professional forecasters have become more optimistic on the inflation outlook than before over the same time horizon.",
        "In the case of households, there is also evidence of the anchoring of expectations.",
        "Consumer confidence in the inflation outlook remaining benign over the year ahead is rising.",
        "Signals extracted from all this information would argue that if the primary target for monetary policy is likely to be achieved on a durable basis, some space opens up for policy attention to the objective of growth as enjoined by the RBI Act.",
        "Given this headroom, the dilemma is two-fold: (1) with growth expected to accelerate from 7 per cent in 2018-19 to 7.2 per cent in 2019-20, is policy support really needed?",
        "(2) even if the case is admissible, is it the right time to steer monetary policy in defence of growth?",
        "Why not exercise prudence and wait and watch for durable signs of underlying pressures on inflation other than food or fuel easing, and/or indications that the slowdown in growth is not a soft patch but a cyclical downswing?",
        "This may avoid wasting ammunition.",
        "To speak to these questions, the baseline projection of growth is subject to downside per cent in the second half of 2018-19, not 7 per cent.",
        "Even if the horizon is extended to incorporate the projections for the first half of 2019-20, real GDP growth is still expected to be sub-7 per cent.",
        "Second, the drivers of growth are fading.",
        "Data that have arrived since the slowing down, with the weakening of sales of fast moving consumer goods implying that consumption spending may be losing steam.",

        "This suggests that the current pace of growth could be difficult to sustain if the capex cycle does not start up soon.",
        "Given the limited fiscal space, the support from government final consumption in 2017-18 (as against the headline GDP growth of 7.2 per cent) and 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 down of global growth and trade imparting downside risks.",
        "Non-oil non-gold imports have contracted, indicative of weakening domestic demand.",

        "Global growth estimates and projections are being marked down as incoming data confirm the loss of momentum that is underway.",

        "Monetary policy has a overarchingly domestic orientation.",
        "With inflation being quiescent and growth at risk, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 25 basis points while maintaining a neutral policy stance.",
        "I will, however, remain watchful about the upturn in food prices that usually precedes the onset of the monsoon.",
        "In the minutes of the February 2019 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had provided several reasons for why I had voted to keep the policy rate at 6.5% and the stance at neutral.",
        "Since then, the headline inflation prints have revealed further softening of inflation in January, followed by a pick-up in February.",
        "Notably, inflation excluding food and fuel softened unexpectedly in January, while reverting somewhat in February; nevertheless, it remains uncomfortably close to 5.5%.",
        "Food inflation, in contrast, has behaved more in line with the expectations; fuel inflation has remained unusually weak.",
        "As per my assessment, these outcomes combined with a further softening of household inflation expectations and a marginal opening up of the output gap (traditional measure), would have justified a rate cut of 25 basis points from 6.5% to 6.25% at the April meeting.",
        "In particular, the softening of inflation excluding food and fuel gives greater durability to the inflation path remaining around the target rate of 4% in the medium term even if the policy rate were to be reduced from 6.5% to 6.25%.",
        "However, given that the MPC had already cut the policy rate to 6.25% at its February meeting, the relevant decision now for me was whether to reduce the policy rate further from 6.25%.",
        "I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged at 6.25% for similar reasons as echoed in my February meeting statement, with some additional uncertainties that I flag below.",
        "First, oil prices have marched upwards by an additional 10% since the February policy.",
        "This rise has taken the Brent Crude price closer to $70 per barrel.",
        "Its momentum cannot be taken lightly given the uncertainty witnessed last year on oil prices and the pressure it puts on inflation, the external sector and financial markets.",
        "While the pass-through to consumers remains somewhat incomplete at present, it will eventually hit the pump prices and generalise through transportation fares into non-fuel components of headline inflation.",
        "Second, food deflation has attendant fiscal risks, as I explained in detail in my February meeting statement.",
        "Fiscal responses to deal with agrarian distress resulting from low food prices can impart a significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, an uncertainty that may get partly resolved in the coming months.",
        "Third, let me reiterate that inflation excluding food and fuel remains uncomfortably close to 5.5%, _i.e., at elevated levels as through most of the past twelve months.",
        "This is_ confirmed also in rising staff costs in the formal sector.",
        "Conversely, it is only the benign food inflation that is allowing the monetary policy to not respond to the discomforting elevated levels of inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "An important observation on food inflation is in order; in all of recent years, even as the level of food inflation has trended downward, it has remained highly volatile within each year; peak-to-trough cycle in food inflation typically tends to be of around 8 months duration, and the month of February has already shown some seasonal uptick in prices of several food items.",
        "Hence, soft food inflation may not persist for long, a scenario in which the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel would steer the headline inflation away from the target rate of 4%.",
        "This can risk hardening of inflation expectations of households.",
        "Fourth, professional forecasters are pegging inflation trajectory somewhat higher than that of the Reserve Bank; this is due to their factoring in some fiscal slippage for this year as well as post-election, as gathered from their qualitative responses.",
        "Dissaving induced by such fiscal slippage also creates a rather weak transmission of monetary policy to the private and household sectors of the economy as bank deposits compete with small savings and corporate bonds with government securities.",
        "These factors, combined with mixed news regarding the prospects of a normal monsoon suggest to me that this is a particularly inopportune time to reduce the interest rate.",
        "interest rates in a clear direction, upward or downward or simply staying put, depending on how the risks play out.",
        "In the meantime, efforts could be made to improve the financial system structurally for better transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, especially as there are headwinds to such transmission from the rise in overall public sector borrowing requirement.",
        "On the growth front, signals from the domestic economy are mixed.",
        "Capacity utilisation continues to improve which augurs well for future investment, and services growth remains robust; however, consumption demand shows signs of weakness.",
        "Global growth is exhibiting a synchronised slowdown; as I have contended in my past statements, mild moderation of global growth benefits India through a downward pressure on oil prices; it is extreme moderation that hurts India and more so through the financial flows channel rather than the trade channel, the latter having been largely insensitive to external prospects in recent years.",
        "Aggregate flow of financial resources to the commercial sector remains robust with banks substituting for the weak credit growth of non-banks; bank credit growth continues to be above nominal GDP growth; equity markets have been buoyant; foreign portfolio flows have reversed into India following the dovish stance of advanced country central banks; together, these imply that the finance-neutral output gap, my preferred measure of output gap which accounts for financial cycles, continues to remain closed.",
        "On balance, therefore, notwithstanding signs of weakness in growth evinced in high frequency economic indicators, I am inclined to wait for some more time for incoming data to resolve several important uncertainties that will shape the Indian economy in the coming one for achieving headline inflation target of 4% on a durable basis in the medium term; continuing oil price rise or fiscal impulses or seasonal uptick in volatile vegetable prices would likely require some tightening down the road; only a substantial collapse in global growth, which seems unlikely at present given proactive responses of central banks in advanced economies and China, would justify a rate cut at this point.",
        "Hence, I am erring on the side of caution, choosing to be patient, rather than supporting another rate cut on the back 78.",
        "Since the last policy in February 2019, there has been further weakening of domestic Inflation has continued to surprise on the downside.",
        "CPI inflation for January and February averaged 2.3 per cent as against projection of 2.8 per cent for the January-March quarter of 2019 in the February policy.",

        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated from 5.6 per cent in December to 5.4 per cent in February.",

        "With this, inflation expectations have declined cumulatively by as much as 160 basis points for the three-month ahead and 170 basis points for one-year ahead horizons in the last four survey rounds.",
        "In comparison with the February policy, CPI inflation projection is now revised however, is subject to several uncertainties, especially from crude oil and food prices.",
        "More precisely, the uncertainties/risks include: (i) the highly uncertain outlook for oil prices, which are vulnerable to both upward pressure due to continuing OPEC production cuts, as well as downward pressure due to further slowing down of the global economy; (ii) the risk of an abrupt reversal in vegetable prices, which may get accentuated due to deficient monsoon further from the present levels if the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity intensifies.",

        "dovish, tending towards easing of rates.",
        "On the domestic front, economic activity has softened due to muted consumption and investment activity, and inflation is benign.",
        "While considerable liquidity easing has already occurred and cumulative rate cuts of 75 basis points have been undertaken in the last three MPC meetings (between February and June 2019), along with a change in stance in June from neutral to accommodative, there is still policy space for a further cut in the policy rate, given the weak global and domestic economic scenario and a benign inflation outlook.",
        "The weighted average call money rate (WACR) has remained broadly aligned with the policy rate, indicating transmission of the reduction in the policy rate.",
        "Policy rate reductions of 75 basis points to other money market rates and G-sec yield have also transmitted fully.",
        "At the same time, though the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh loans of banks has improved from 21 basis points in February and March to 29 basis points during February to June, it was partial, possibly due to transmission lags associated with monetary policy.",
        "Nevertheless, the significant monetary policy easing since February 2019, along with surplus liquidity, are likely to enable more transmission to lending rates, and eventually to the real economy.",
        "Further, in view of the shadow banking stress, the importance of surplus liquidity has increased.",
        "In this regard, measures taken by the government and the RBI to encourage flow of credit to shadow banks are important confidence building steps.",
        "It is also important to recognize that, while monetary policy can impact cyclical factors, it has its limitations with respect to significantly impacting structural factors.",
        "Therefore, investmentfocused fiscal policy and active continuation of structural reforms are imperative at this juncture to complement the already substantial easing that has been delivered since February 2019.",
        "In this context, the directional shift in the Budget towards a lower fiscal deficit target may also contribute towards lowering the cost of capital and boosting investment driven growth.",
        "Overall, given that the headline inflation is projected to remain below target in 2019-20, I vote for a pre-emptive rate cut of 25 basis points to enhance consumer confidence and improve investor sentiment.",
        "On a cumulative basis, this denotes a policy rate cut of 100 basis points since February 2019, which is sufficient at this point in time.",
        "I also vote to keep the stance as accommodative.",
        "After the last meeting of MPC in June 2019, several important events have occurred.",
        "Inflation readings for May and June 2019 were almost as per the RBI projections.",
        "While the Economic Survey 2018-19 provided a growth assessment very similar to the one by RBI, the Union Budget 2019-20 assumed a substantially higher growth rate for the current fiscal year.",
        "Monsoon is likely to be normal.",
        "Tariff war tensions have further escalated.",
        "Oil prices have continued fluctuating within the range I had mentioned in my earlier statements.",
        "Growth impulses are, however, weak on the whole and not significantly picking up for substantial revival.",
        "It is well recognized in the literature and reiterated by the Economic Survey 2018-19 that investment is a primary driver for economic growth and employment creation.",
        "In order to boost investment activities, positive sentiments and business-conducive environment need to be enhanced.",
        "It requires carrying out several economic reform measures in the land and labour markets, tariffs of electricity and other resources, and taxation of income and goods and services, besides urgently correcting prevailing high real interest rates in India.",
        "While most of these measures are not within the purview of the monetary policy, correction of high real interest rates to a certain extent is.",
        "Since I do not see any major threat to inflation in the foreseeable future, I would like to vote for a 35 bps i) RBI surveys have found that the corporates are now investing more in the financial assets than in the physical assets.",
        "Thus, they are turning savers rather than investors.",
        "This provides indirect evidence of the adverse impact of high real interest rates prevailing in the economy.",
        "Economic reform measures would be more effective if the necessary incentives in terms of costs are there.",
        "ii) Fiscal slippage is not a matter of serious concern for the rest of the year, because the Union Budget has maintained the target given in the fiscal consolidation path and the state budgets put together are also not likely to show any serious divergence from the path.",
        "iii) The fiscal policy as indicated by the Union Budget 2019-20 on the contrary is on a tighter side rather than expansionary side.",
        "The budgeted fiscal deficit this year and projected for the next two years in the medium term strategy paper are very much on the fiscal consolidation path notwithstanding current slowdown and emergence of substantial negative output gap.",
        "As I had argued in my statement in the previous MPC meeting, adhering to the fiscal deficit target during a downturn of the business cycle amounts to a tight fiscal policy.",
        "It is also corroborated by the increased taxation and maintaining expenditure relative to GDP in the budget.",
        "The monetary policy has to, therefore, do its bit to provide the boost to the economy however short-lived it may be, because currently iv) Globally, central banks have not only been dovish in their stance but have also cut their policy rates.",
        "v) Inflationary expectations one year ahead by households have been declining and the latest round shows about a 20 bps fall over the previous round.",
        "If one outlier city is excluded, the fall is much larger.",
        "Similarly the business expectations about headline CPI inflation one year ahead by the IIMA survey shows the expectation of about 3.7 percent, which is very close to the RBI prediction as well.",
        "vi) Thus, there is enough policy space to cut the policy repo rate to correct the high real interest rate in the economy.",
        "The transmission of the policy rate cuts in the current cycle is likely to take some time because of the lags involved on account of the nature of the banking business.",
        "However, under prevailing circumstances, the immediate transmission should be considered not so much in terms of the bank deposit and lending rates but more specific rates influencing new investments such as housing loans, vehicle loans and long term bonds.",
        "Given that there is a significant policy space to correct the real rate of interest and thereby helping the economic activities to recover, it is prudent in my opinion to cut the policy rate somewhat aggressively but cautiously keeping some space for future exigencies.",
        "As far as the general practice of taking 25 bps as a unit for cutting or raising the policy rate is concerned, there is no logic or scientific basis for it, particularly when we measure inflation rate, GDP growth rate, fiscal deficit percentage, etc.",
        "Ideally, there is a case for considering the unit to be 10 bps for cutting or raising the policy rate.",
        "I would, therefore, like to cut the policy rate by 40 bps, but I do not mind going with majority opinion of cutting the rate by 35 bps this time, and maintaining the accommodative stance.",
        "Since the MPC met in June, the macroeconomic outlook appears to have darkened, denting business and consumer confidence.",
        "This deterioration is getting reflected in inflation outcomes: (a) a pre-monsoon food price build-up was anticipated and it is tracking the seven-year average prices are actually stabilising; have been no unruly spikes; moreover, they fall in the remit of supply management policies, since they either reflect sectoral imbalances or cost push factors and nimble steps assume priority in order to prevent price pressures from accumulating; (c) the dynamics of inflation excluding food and fuel warrant concern, especially its broad based and persisting softness because it seems to be mirroring the weakening of domestic demand.",
        "In terms of the technology of monetary policy, the intrinsic link between underlying some recent loss of faith.",
        "This validates the policy actions and a shift in the stance since February 2019.",
        "Turning to the state of the economy, virtually every indicator of activity is turning down.",
        "Global growth flattered in Q1 of 2019 only to deceive in Q2.",
        "Global trade is in contraction.",
        "In India, high frequency indicators have focused the narrative on the slowdown in investment, the silence of the animal spirits embodied in the flattening of capital goods production, the absolute decline in capital goods imports and the deceleration in construction activity.",
        "What is worrisome though is that other components of aggregate demand could be joining investment in the loss of speed.",
        "Private consumption, the bedrock of domestic demand (57 per cent of GDP), is losing momentum in both urban and rural areas.",
        "Meanwhile, the deceleration in external demand on account of trade and geopolitical tensions has muted exports and sunk imports into contraction.",
        "The fiscal stimulus from the 7[th] Pay Commission award and one rank one pension (OROP) is fading (0.9 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 and 0.3 per cent in 2018-19); this was expected as the stimulus was in the form of revenue expenditure and the revenue multiplier in India is less than unity.",
        "The key issue is: what is the extent of the downturn?",
        "This is hard to decipher at this stage projections of growth are being repeatedly marked down.",
        "The number of central banks that have becoming visible.",
        "In India, negative gaps have opened up in respect of both output and inflation, warranting an appropriate policy response.",
        "The issue is: how is the policy headroom to be used?",
        "Monetary policy has been proactive and front-loaded as the first line of defence.",
        "From here on, the space for monetary policy action has to be calibrated to the evolving situation, especially as the nature and depth of the slowdown is still unravelling and elbow room may be needed if it deepens.",
        "A more broad-sided response involving all levers of policy acquires the highest priority now.",
        "The overarching goal is to reinvigorate domestic demand and the time to do it is now.",
        "On these considerations, I vote for a 35 basis points reduction in the policy rate while persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "The inflation trajectory has evolved since the June 2019 policy on the expected lines.",
        "Among the components, food inflation has turned up, while inflation excluding food and fuel has shown distinct moderation.",
        "Reflecting the weak demand conditions as well as lower input costs, the CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, has seen a moderation of around 100 bps since March 2019.",
        "This moderation is broad based.",
        "Food inflation on the other hand registered a sharp increase to 2.4 per cent in June from 0.7 per cent in March largely due to a pick-up in prices of vegetables and pulses.",
        "Significant inflation pressures continued in meat and fish.",
        "Headline CPI inflation in the June 2019 policy.",
        "The three-month ahead inflation expectations of households based on the ahead inflation expectations have moderated by 20 bps.",
        "Global growth has weakened, and several central banks have adopted more accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "Domestic growth is also slowing down.",
        "A worrisome aspect of the recent growth slowdown is the moderation in private consumption which constitutes the largest segment of aggregate demand.",
        "Rural demand indicators like tractor and motorcycle sales continued to contract in May-June.",
        "Urban demand indicators, like passenger vehicle sales, contracted for the eighth consecutive month in June.",
        "Commercial vehicle sales also contracted during June.",
        "Construction activity indicators weakened with contraction in cement production and slower demand conditions in Q2.",
        "Cumulative repo rate reduction of 75 bps effected since February 2019 has so far resulted in 29 bps reduction in weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks on fresh rupee loans.",
        "This is considered inadequate even though the transmission is expected to improve, going forward.",
        "The projected inflation path suggests that headline inflation is expected to remain below 4 per cent for the next four quarters up to Q1:2020-21.",
        "GDP growth projection for 2019-20 has been successively revised down from 7.4 per cent (in February 2019) to 7.2 per cent (in April 2019), 7.0 per cent (in June 2019) and to 6.9 per cent in the 3rd bi-monthly policy of August 2019.",
        "Given the benign inflation outlook that is expected to continue for the rest of the year and up to Q1:2020-21, I am of the view that there is a need for monetary policy action to support economic activity and close the output gap.",
        "I, therefore, vote for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 35 bps and also keep the stance of monetary policy as accommodative.",
        "Economic activity has shown signs of further weakening since the last MPC meeting in June 2019.",
        "Several high frequency indicators have either slowed down or contracted in recent months.",
        "Headline CPI inflation has evolved broadly along the projected lines; CPI inflation excluding food and fuel continued to soften, while food inflation has edged up.",
        "Global economic activity has been losing pace, weighed down by intensifying trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty.",
        "GDP numbers for Q2:2019 in respect of some major advanced and emerging market economies have been subdued.",
        "Central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies have been increasingly resorting to more accommodative stances of monetary policy.",
        "On the other hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated for the fourth consecutive month to 4.1 per cent in June, caused by a broad-based softening across groups, particularly clothing and footwear; household goods and services; and transport and communication.",
        "This reflects subdued input cost pressures relating to both agriculture and industrial raw materials and further weakening of domestic demand conditions.",
        "Inflation in the fuel and light group also decelerated in May-June, despite the uptick in liquified petroleum gas survey moderated further by 20 basis points for the 1-year ahead horizon, though they remained unchanged for the 3-month ahead horizon.",
        "Cumulatively, inflation expectations of households have declined significantly by 180 basis points for the 3-month horizon and 190 basis points for the 1-year horizon in last five survey rounds.",
        "This suggests that inflation expectations of households are gradually getting better anchored.",
        "Overall, the inflation situation remains benign.",
        "Turning to economic activity, total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago, with significant catching up taking place in recent weeks.",
        "Industrial activity continued to be weak in May 2019, impacted mainly by manufacturing and mining.",
        "In terms of use-based classification, growth of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated.",

        "Merchandise exports and imports contracted in June.",
        "Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation moderated to 74.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.6 per cent in Q3.",
        "Based on early results of listed companies, demand conditions in the manufacturing sector remained weak in Q1:2019-20, with sales of manufacturing companies contracting by 2.4 per cent (y-o-y), caused mainly by petroleum, automobile and iron and steel companies.",
        "On the positive side, the Reserve PMI rose in July, supported by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead.",
        "Several high frequency indicators for May-June also suggest weakening of services sector activity.",
        "Two key indicators of rural demand, _viz., tractor and motorcycle sales, continued to_ contract.",
        "Among indicators of urban demand, while passenger vehicle sales contracted in June, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of contraction.",
        "Two key indicators of construction activity, _viz., cement production and steel_ consumption, also contracted/slowed down.",

        "The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of banks has declined by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far (February-June 2019).",
        "The transmission to bank lending rates has been inadequate, though it is expected to improve in the coming weeks and months.",
        "Credit growth has 74.",
        "Overall, there is clear evidence of domestic demand slowing down further.",
        "Investment activity has been losing traction.",

        "Private consumption, which has been the mainstay of domestic demand, has also decelerated.",
        "The slowing down of domestic demand is also reflected in significant moderation in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel; and contraction in merchandise imports.",
        "In view of weakening of domestic growth impulses and unsettled global macroeconomic environment, there is a need to bolster dwindling domestic demand and support investment activity, even as the impact of past three rate cuts is gradually working its way to the real economy.",
        "With headline inflation projected to remain within the target over the next one-year horizon, supporting domestic growth by further reducing interest rates needs to be given the utmost priority.",
        "Given the current and evolving inflation and growth scenario at this juncture, it can no longer be a business as usual approach.",
        "The economy needs a larger push.",
        "I am, therefore, of the view that a reduction in the policy repo rate by conventional 25 bps will be inadequate.",
        "On the other hand, a 50 bps rate cut might be excessive and indicate a knee jerk reaction.",
        "A policy rate adjustment of 25 bps or multiples thereof may not always be consistent with the evolving macroeconomic situation.",
        "Hence, at times it is apposite to calibrate the size of the conventional rate adjustment.",
        "Considering these aspects, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 35 basis points and for continuing with the accommodative stance of monetary policy.",
        "The calibration of the size of the rate cut is expected to reinforce and quicken the impact of (i) the past cumulative rate reduction of 75 basis points; (ii) change in the stance from neutral to accommodative; and (iii) injection of large surplus liquidity in the system."

        "Macroeconomic adjustments of saving-investment balance will be critical as global interest rate cycle changes in face of tapers and lift offs.",
        "While we are very close to growth having revived, its durability is still not entirely clear.",
        "On the other hand, inflation has come back below upper tolerance level for the last four months and while the upside risks exist, the baseline affords some comfort that inflation should stay mid-way between the target and the upper tolerance band in H1:2022-23.",
        "If one were certain about a broad-based durable growth revival, monetary policy could have acted now to pre-empt the possibility of inflation resurgence.",
        "However, the key question is whether the economy can entail the output sacrifice it may bring at a time when the recovery is nascent.",
        "Therefore, it will be best not to risk strengthening stagflationary impulses that already are being policy normalisation may be sufficient now and one can decide to shift to a tightening monetary policy cycle at a point when it is clear that demand revival has acquired resilience and pandemic risks to growth have diminished or alternatively if inflation diffusion persists in near months which then can result in inflation getting generalised and persist next year, especially if inflation expectations get unanchored.",

        "Clearly, financial conditions are highly fragile, vulnerable to volatile shifts and not conducive to a strong and broad-based recovery.",
        "Consequently, markets and analysts get increasingly certain that inflation may remain elevated through the greater part of 2022 and growth will slow further absent policy action to unclog supply bottlenecks.",
        "Some evidence of this happening is already there.",
        "Finished goods inventories are piling up as shown in PMIs of several advanced countries and promises of discounts, sales and faster deliveries are getting louder.",

        "The economic recovery after the pandemic shock of 2020 remains uneven and incomplete, and the renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country has increased the downside risk to the growth momentum.",
        "On the other hand, inflation rates have been consistently well above the mid point of the target zone and is forecast to remain elevated for some time.",
        "This is a difficult situation, but I believe that the balance of risk and reward is in favour of monetary accommodation.",
        "Therefore, I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level, and I also support the accommodative stance.",
        "The question that remains is about the time based forward guidance (first provided in October 2020) that is expiring now as we have already entered the new financial year.",
        "From my perspective, the principal motivation for the forward guidance was to reduce long term yields in the backdrop of an excessively steep yield curve.",
        "Unfortunately, forward guidance has failed to flatten the yield curve, and I see little merit in persisting with it any more.",
        "As the popular quote (often misattributed to Albert Einstein) says: insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.",
        "A flattening of the yield curve remains an important goal but, I think it must be pursued using other instruments which largely lie outside the remit of the MPC.",
        "There is another reason why time based forward guidance is no longer appropriate.",
        "Experience of the last several months indicates that in the aftermath of the pandemic, forecasting has become more difficult.",
        "It is apparent that some economic and statistical relationships have tended to break down in the current exceptional environment.",
        "Consequently, model risk has now become an important issue as evidenced both in large realized forecast errors and in the dispersion of forecasts from different models.",
        "Model risk presents a far less tractable problem than the well defined statistical prediction error of any single model.",
        "In this situation, I think it is not prudent to repose excessive faith in forecasts.",
        "Instead, the MPC must have the agility and flexibility to respond rapidly and adequately to whatever surprises new data may bring in future.",
        "Time based guidance is inconsistent with this imperative.",
        "Both these considerations weigh in favour of state contingent guidance that reaffirms the sustain growth on a durable basis while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "The Central Government, in consultation with the Bank, retained the inflation target and the tolerance bands for the next five years.",
        "At the outset, I wish to acknowledge this, both from the viewpoint of the sage counsel exercised and the accountability it imposes on the MPC going forward.",
        "Over the first five-year period of practicing inflation targeting, the headline inflation averaged 4.3 per cent compared with the situation when the CPI inflation was averaging around double digits for six years before this framework was conceived.",
        "[1] The retention of the target will go a long way in preserving the macro-economic stability and the credibility of the framework.",
        "However, the success of this framework has not been unfettered.",
        "The volatility of inflation has remained high as manifested in higher coefficient of variation.",
        "However, this is largely reflection of supply disruptions during the pandemic period at a time where the growth collapse warranted monetary policy to prop up demand.",
        "Better supply management and greater recognition that growth-inflation trade-offs dissipate in long-run can help lower inflation volatility ahead.",
        "Let me now turn to business at hand.",
        "The five significant differences since we last met in early February are: (i) the sudden resurgence of the Covid-19 infections; (ii) emergence of incipient signs that the recovery is beginning to lose some steam; (iii) return of inflation after a short-lived decline to the target; (iv) asset prices facing resistance after a runaway rally from the pandemic lows a year ago; (v) some indications of the path of fiscal consolidation going forward that still needs further clarity.",
        "The current account has also slipped back into a small deficit, but I will not judge this as material to our decision in this policy.",
        "Let me briefly discuss all of these.",
        "After a remarkable decline in Covid-19 incidence during mid-September 2020 to mid February 2021, daily new confirmed cases have spiked back to about 100 thousand.",
        "More than half of these new cases have come from Maharashtra that accounts for about 9.0 per cent of the if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon.",
        "This is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort.",
        "While the countrywide dispensation is still quite supportive of production activity, this can change if the virus spread, hitherto contained to few States, might transmit across country.",
        "Learning effects on calibrating stringency of restrictions may keep economic costs of the second wave much lower than the first but still retard full normalisation by a quarter or two.",
        "Ramping up vaccination, testing and treatment holds the key to protecting economic recovery and health policies have become the first line of defence.",
        "Monetary and fiscal policies can only play a second fiddle.",
        "Going forward, the GDP growth in Q4: 2020-21 is likely to surpass its implied growth in in 2021-22 with a baseline projection of 10.5 per cent; but this high growth will essentially be on account of an all-time low base.",
        "The realisation of the projected growth will translate to only a meagre average growth rate of 0.85 per cent in two years following 2019-20.",
        "This provides investment need to be stimulated.",
        "Capacity utilisation rate at 66.6 per cent in the latest RBI survey is well below the long-term average of 73.6 per cent and though there is evidence of some small ticket investments reflected in pick up in short cycle capital goods, an upturn in capex cycle will require larger public investments that can crowd in private investments.",
        "Consumption needs support from removing credit frictions and more redistributive policies.",
        "Recovery is beginning to lose some steam.",
        "The IIP returned to the contraction zone in January and will remain so in February.",
        "The output of the eight core industries, in February, 1 Headline inflation measured by All Groups combined CPI averaged 4.3 per cent for the period October 2016 to which headline inflation was not computed and imputed back-prints were made available later.",
        "The annual average CPI-Industrial Workers inflation had touched double digits or stayed just underneath for the last six years 2008-09 to 2013-14, prompting Reserve Bank to revise and strengthen its monetary policy framework.",
        "But for the extra day in leap year 2020, the contraction would have been smaller with growth at (-)1.2 per cent instead of (-)4.6 per cent.",
        "Extrapolating February output for 31-days as in January, the month-on-month growth would have been (+)2.0 per cent instead of (-)7.8 per cent.",
        "The sequential improvement in high frequency indicators of real activity witnessed some loss of momentum in January with bulk of normalisation getting completed.",
        "In February, almost half of the indicators did not improve.",
        "This again may have lot to do with the peculiarity of the February month, but the second wave can entrench this trend.",
        "Inflation rose back to 5.0 per cent in February after receding close to target at 4.1 per cent in January 2021.",
        "The momentum was somewhat above average, especially driven by core and fuel.",
        "Furthermore, the momentum in WPI was markedly above average.",
        "In each of the last four months, WPI prices have increased for larger number of commodities than ever in any of the months since October 2013.",
        "Therefore, momentum pressures for CPI may exacerbate in near term if producers hitherto absorbing a large part of cost push pressures decide to passthrough the price pressures to retail level.",
        "So far, this is not much seen in the CPI with lower-than-average CPI items witnessing price increases over last three months.",
        "Global commodity prices, both energy and non-energy, have surged since June 2020.",
        "The increases have been marked in case of crude oil, metals and food.",
        "The FAO food price index is higher by 27.5 per cent, while that for edible oils by 89.4 per cent.",
        "Imported commodities have a weight of about 22 per cent in CPI.",
        "Some price pressures may arise as a rise in global non-food commodity prices by 10 per cent is expected to increase CPI core goods inflation up to 50 bps.",
        "However, the passthrough to headline inflation is low.",
        "Therefore, despite the emerging risks and price pressures it should be possible to keep inflation within the band.",
        "Asset prices are seemingly facing resistance after a runaway rally from the pandemic lows a year ago.",
        "Mundell has just left us, but his legacy will continue to haunt monetary policy as it manages the impossible trinity through surges and stops of capital flows.",
        "During February and March, EM equities have weakened slightly as global bonds faced a sell-off with US 10-year yield hardening 67 basis points.",
        "Benchmark yields in most emerging markets rose more sharply over the same period but in India the rise was contained to 26 bps.",
        "Indian rupee till now has remained stable and bucked the global trend of depreciating EM currencies.",
        "There is risk in too much focus on asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Credit channel that works in tandem with interest rate channel is far more important than the asset price channel for effective monetary transmission.",
        "Countries have certainly relied on negative nominal or real rates in an attempt to avert deep recessions.",
        "In part they have helped limit job losses and scarring.",
        "However, these benefits have to be weighed against the low interest rates fuelling K-shaped recoveries with increased inequalities and inflicting financial repression for savers.",
        "Also, there are added macroeconomic risks for countries where inflation is not as dampened as in Advanced Economies that are resorting to unconventional policies.",
        "It is equally important to understand that while increasing fiscal space to the extent possible is desirable, any revision in fiscal targets should be consistent with medium-term debt sustainability and should not impinge on conduct of monetary policy, such as requiring direct monetisation that has been eschewed even by countries with low inflation.",
        "Lastly, the current account deficit in small size as expected is least of a worry, but going forward, with wide fiscal gaps, large twin deficits must be avoided over the medium term.",
        "While we had moved towards calibrated exit from extra-ordinary supportive measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 as the curve was flattening, we have already made considerable adjustments in exit dates for these measures.",
        "The extant priority is now to continue supporting growth from the possible shock from the second wave.",
        "I, therefore, vote for retaining the policy rate at present level and continue with the accommodative stance as spelled out in resolution.",
        "I as per judgment based on scientific facts.",
        "I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to maintain an accommodative stance as waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations; moderation in several high frequency sentiment indicators; global risks and spillovers.",
        "Monetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure footed and its sustainability assured.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation middled the tolerance band in December and January and aligned with the target; although it has risen in February, it is expected to remain within the corridor over a 12month horizon.",
        "Longer term inflation expectations remain broadly stable in spite of high volatility in food and fuel prices.",
        "Demand pull is still weak.",
        "The inflation print of February reflects pandemic retail margins and increased costs of doing business as supply chains are still mending.",
        "Accordingly, I would continue to look through the recent elevation in inflation and remain focused on reviving the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth.",
        "An integral part of this approach would be to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and volatility so that congenial financial conditions continue to support growth.",
        "Economic activity and inflation developments over the past two months have been largely along the anticipated lines.",
        "The curve of active cases of COVID-19, which was on a downward trend till mid-February, has changed its course with a surge in several parts of the country.",
        "Experience of other countries suggest that this new surge can be more infectious due to several mutations of the virus.",
        "Rapidly rising cases of COVID-19 is the single biggest challenge to ongoing recovery in the Indian economy.",
        "Learnings of last one year should, however, help us in managing the crisis as it unfolds.",
        "Global growth is gradually recovering, even though it remains uneven across countries, reflecting the substantial differences in the infections trajectory, the speed of vaccination drives, and the size of fiscal stimulus.",
        "International organisations are gradually scaling up their global investment demand.",
        "At the same time, global financial markets have turned volatile over inflation fears in advanced economies and rising commodity prices, posing risks to the domestic outlook.",
        "In the domestic economy, there are clear signs of revival of growth.",
        "The agricultural sector has been resilient throughout the pandemic period.",
        "Manufacturing and services activities continue to normalise as reflected in key high frequency indicators such as mobility data; issuance of eway bills; GST revenue; wholesale dispatches of automobile; registrations of passenger vehicles and construction equipment vehicles; rail and water cargo; highway toll collections; and electricity generation.",
        "These indicators represent a wide range of sectors that are maintaining their pace, which we had noticed in the previous round of MPC deliberations as well.",
        "While there was a slight dip in industrial production during January, PMI manufacturing remained resilient.",
        "Manufacturing companies assessed further strengthening of production, order books and employment during Q4:2020-21 according to a survey conducted by the RBI.",
        "Forward looking surveys suggest further improvement in production and overall business situation during 2021-22.",
        "Capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector recovered further.",
        "A revival in real estate and residential construction activity also seems to be underway as reflected in stamp and registration duty collections in select states in February 2021, backed by revival in domestic demand were discernible in the current account balance which swung into imports have attained their pre-pandemic levels in Q4:2020-21.",
        "Foreign direct investment flows have been running higher than the previous year.",
        "While strong domestic fundamentals and healthy level of foreign exchange reserves shall bode well for the external sector, the speed of domestic vaccination drive will be key in containing short-term risks to domestic economic recovery and mitigating spillovers from global shocks.",
        "All these indicators suggest that the real GDP is evolving on the lines of the February MPC resolution.",
        "Improving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the Government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects.",
        "The recent jump in COVID-19 infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully.",
        "Headline inflation registered significant softening in January 2021 to move close to the target rate from levels that were substantially above the upper tolerance threshold.",
        "A sharp correction in food inflation helped to bring about this rapid disinflation.",
        "In February, however, headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent from 4.1 per cent in January, primarily due to volatility imparted by adverse base effects.",
        "On the other hand, core inflation remained elevated.",
        "Going ahead, sustenance of key factors like the bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21; mitigation of price pressures through timely supply-side measures on key food items such as pulses and edible oils; and coordinated reduction in taxes on petroleum products by centre and states can help assuage cost pressures on inflation.",
        "On the other hand, a combination of high international commodity prices and logistics costs may push up input price pressures across manufacturing and services.",
        "The projection of inflation rate at 5 per cent for the full year 2021-22, with 5.2 per cent for the first half and 4.8 per cent for the second half, takes into account both the upside and the downside pressures.",
        "The April 2021 MPC meeting was the first after the Government notification of March 31, 2021 retaining the inflation target at 4 per cent with the lower and the upper tolerance levels of 2 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, for the next five years (April 2021-March 2026).",
        "The successful implementation of the flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework since 2016 has resulted in better anchoring of inflation expectations, especially those of financial market participants, around the 4 per cent target rate.",
        "It has also improved transparency of monetary policy process.",
        "The resultant increase in monetary policy credibility has helped the MPC to respond effectively to the growth-inflation trade-offs posed by an exceptional shock like the COVID-19.",

        "This would help create pre-conditions in financial markets that support a durable economic recovery.",
        "The secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0, where the RBI has committed upfront a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities is a step in this direction to ensure congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction.",

        "The need of the hour is to effectively secure the economic recovery underway so that it becomes broad-based and durable.",
        "The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook.",

        "World merchandise trade continues to recover as external demand resumes, though elevated freight rates and container dislocations are emerging as constraints.",
        "CPI inflation is firming up in most AEs, driven by release of pent-up demand, elevated input prices and unfavourable base effects.",
        "Inflation in major EMEs has been generally close to or above official targets in recent months, pushed up by the sustained rise in global food and commodity prices.",

        "Urban demand has been dented by the second wave, but adoption of new COVID-compatible occupational models by businesses for an appropriate working environment may cushion the hit to economic activity, especially in manufacturing and services sectors that are not contact intensive.",
        "On the other hand, the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector.",
        "Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and supportive of economic activity.",

        "In this backdrop the projected growth of GDP in 2021-22 at 9.5 per cent, revised downward from the 10.5 per cent, projected in April 2021 will require continued fiscal and monetary policy support, besides other measures to enable expansion of economic activities and keeping the population safe from the pandemic.",

        "This may be partly due to low capacity utilization.",
        "They have not passed on a fall in wages and many other costs such as travel.",

        "First, as a baseline, inflation is expected to stay elevated from the target but below the upper tolerance level through the year.",
        "However, the probability distribution indicated in the fan chart shows that risks of breaching the upper tolerance level are not insignificant.",
        "But for the extra-ordinary circumstances that prevail, we would have moved to a neutral stance long back.",
        "I had earlier in my statements starting October 2020 stated that output gap will close towards the end of 2021-22.",
        "The second wave is likely to push back normalisation a bit but not a lot.",
        "A range of filtering techniques still suggest closure of output gap as a ratio of level of potential GDP by the end of this year but we cannot rely on them mechanically as these techniques have high dependence on the end points.",
        "Therefore, we need to make some allowance for the uncertainty around that.",
        "We can continue to support growth for now as the flexible inflation targeting framework allows temporary deviation from the target so long as inflation is expected to be within tolerance bands.",
        "There are risks to inflation as there have been general price pressures at the WPI level and its inflation as well as its momentum is at its highest for the index with the current base.",
        "However, the passthrough of cost-push inflation at the retail level has stayed muted amid demand deficiency.",
        "Also, credit growth remains anaemic and nominal broad money growth as well as money multiplier adjusted for reverse repo remain low.",
        "So, support to growth can continue at this juncture.",
        "In my view, clear signs of generalisation in CPI inflation setting in could be a tipping point where growth-inflation dynamics could alter.",
        "Also, with a further rise in elevated inflation expectations, policy may need to respond if these expectations are becoming unhinged.",
        "While the odds are that we can avert this as inflation softens back in H2, the uncertainties ahead provide a rationale to avert any time-based guidance, especially as transmission lags exist.",
        "Secondly, we need to consider the policy trade-off between leaving policy rate unchanged and correcting it at some point for the negative real rates that have persisted for a spectrum of interest rates thus taxing savers.",
        "The frontier of the macroeconomics, especially in terms of Heterogenous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models provide a good reason to think that not all savers may necessarily be worse off when central banks push down the interest rates.",
        "These models capture additional effects that are heterogenous.",
        "As demand increases with monetary expansion, firms ramp up production.",
        "This improves their survival rate amid a deep shock like the pandemic.",
        "It also protects job losses and pushes more wages and salaries in the hands of households most of whom may get more than compensated for a drop in their interest incomes on saving.",
        "With a large proportion of low income and other liquidity constrained households in India, these indirect second-round effects could turn very significant.",
        "Furthermore, low interest rates create space for and liquidity accommodation.",
        "My judgment is that the policy has worked well in dampening scarring, limiting job losses, generating wealth effects from higher asset prices, thus supporting incomes and consumption under some very difficult circumstances.",
        "Its continuation for long, though carries the hazard of unintended consequences as incomes may instead fall in real terms worsening its distribution as well.",
        "Monetary accommodation, when coordinated with expansionary fiscal policy has a greater impact on output gap but may also cause slope of the Phillips curve to turn steeper over time.",
        "Nevertheless, retail inflation is not yet predominantly demand-driven and to accept output sacrifice at this stage may not be the best policy choice.",
        "Taking full cognisance of these policy trade-offs, I judge that withdrawing support to growth at this stage may be premature as it may dampen second-round effects.",
        "I, therefore, vote for retaining the policy rate at present level and continue with the stance as spelled out in resolution.",
        "I vote to maintain status quo on the policy rate and on the stance of policy.",

        "Unlike in the first wave, supply conditions have remained relatively resilient in the second wave, but aggregate demand barring net exports has been dented and needs counter-pandemic policy support.",
        "Even the turnaround in net exports is fragile and heavily dependent on the strength of the vaccinationpropelled revival in external demand, which may be partially offset by the terms of trade loss on account of the rise in international commodity prices, particularly crude oil.",
        "price pressures on some constituents of the food category may remain benign in the near-term in spite of the usual pre-monsoon upturn.",
        "Input pressures will work towards keeping core inflation elevated, while some food prices will reflect persisting demand-supply imbalances, but in the absence of strong demand, the pass-through to retail inflation is likely to be incomplete and delayed, especially with respect to prices of services.",
        "The outlook for energy inflation is the main upside risk, especially as the timing and magnitude of reflation of global demand to pre-pandemic levels is uncertain.",
        "This warrants close and continuous watching, with preparedness to take countervailing action in the form of duty/tax reductions.",
        "The recent initiative of a Group of Ministers monitoring supply conditions with greater intensity is a welcome step in the right direction and should be matched by proactive actions as necessary to deflect imported input costs from adding to inflationary pressures.",
        "The MPC has created the necessary conditions for supporting growth by maintaining the policy rate at its lowest level ever.",
        "It has also provided credible forward guidance matched by actions, committing to a path for future short-term interest rates that should re-engineer the recovery that was dented by the impact of the second wave of COVID-19, given the limited headroom from inflation remaining aligned with the target in April and forecast to stay within the guidance on an ongoing basis by ensuring congenial financial conditions across the system as well as for specific sectors, instruments and institutions.",
        "With credit growth remaining subdued despite monetary transmission being reasonably full, the Reserve Bank is galvanising market-based channels of financing as well as off-market channels such as refinancing institutions.",
        "It is also proactively engaged in operations that convey the monetary policy stance directly across the term structure of interest rates.",
        "By keeping the policy rate unchanged and by persevering with the accommodative stance in this meeting, the MPC creates the space for further easing of financial conditions by the Reserve Bank.",
        "When we last met in early April, the second wave of COVID-19 infections had started increasing but was still restricted to a few states.",
        "In the subsequent weeks, however, the surge in new infections turned severe and broad-based both in its spread across states and in the intensity of the increase, putting enormous pressure on the health system with heavy toll on human lives.",
        "The lockdown restrictions and containment measures undertaken by the states have led to a significant moderation of new infections and active cases; at the same time, it has taken some toll on the economy, as reflected in high-frequency economic and mobility indicators.",
        "We have now started seeing a phased relaxation of the restrictions in some states and can expect activity across the country to normalise from the beginning of July, if this trend persists.",
        "The indicators of rural as well as urban demand suggest that economic activity was normalising and gaining a strong foothold in Q4:2020-21 with broad-based recovery driven by revival in real estate, manufacturing, construction and trade and financial services.",
        "With decline in infections, there were nascent signs of revival in the capex cycle during Q4:2020-21 as reflected in indicators like steel consumption; cement production; imports and production of capital goods.",
        "The recovery also got reflected in the strong print of the real gross value added (GVA) growth for the same quarter.",
        "This momentum in activity got abruptly disrupted with the onset of the second wave.",
        "The infection containment efforts this time around were localised and calibrated, which allowed manufacturing and industrial activity to operate in varying degrees across states during this period.",
        "At the same time, businesses and supply chains have increasingly adapted to working in the pandemic and restricted environment.",
        "Also, the reverse migration of labour to villages has been muted relative to last year and inter-state movement of goods continues smoothly.",
        "Overall, it is expected that the loss in momentum of activity could be temporary and restricted to the first quarter of 2021-22.",
        "Going forward, agriculture is expected to be the bright spot in the current year as well after remaining the fulcrum of growth during 2020-21.",
        "The upward revision of monsoon forecast with good spatial distribution augurs well for this expectation.",
        "Further, exports have exhibited resilience destinations, it is anticipated that net exports would remain a propellant of growth in the current year.",
        "Enhanced and targeted policy support to exports can buttress this process further.",
        "The central government capex, which is budgeted to expand at a robust pace for 2021-22 (overall capital expenditure is budgeted to increase by 30.5 per cent within which capital outlay is budgeted to increase by 63.4 per cent) along with infrastructure pipeline, should reignite investment cycle once restrictions are eased.",

        "Headline inflation moderated to 4.3 per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in March.",
        "Large base effects played a crucial role and inflation sobered across food as well as core groups.",
        "A softening inflation print provides some relief and policy space enabling the Reserve Bank to step up liquidity infusion into of reviving and sustaining growth on a durable basis.",
        "Moreover, the fragile demand conditions could help limit the pass-through of input cost pressures across manufacturing and services to output prices.",
        "Going forward, CPI inflation for 2021-22 is projected to be at 5.1 per cent, which is watch on the evolving trajectory considering the uncertainties, both on the upside and downside, to the baseline path.",
        "Given the predominant role of supply side factors in the recent inflation movements, active and timely supply side policy measures with regard to petrol and diesel, edible oil and pulses, among others, would be critical to bring about a durable softening of price pressures.",
        "Overall, the second wave of COVID-19 has altered the near-term outlook, and policy return to normalcy.",
        "The dent on economic activity due to the second wave of the virus has necessitated the continuation of monetary measures to support the process of economic recovery to make it durable.",
        "I therefore vote for a pause on the repo rate.",
        "At the same time, there is a need to strengthen forward guidance by stressing the aspect of revival of growth.",
        "Thus, the emphasis should be to continue with accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while unambiguous commitment of the MPC to revive and sustain the growth process.",
        "In fact, focus on revival and sustenance of growth is the most desirable policy option while of course remaining watchful of the inflation trajectory.",

        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent.",

        "Research shows that while temporary commodity spikes are looked through, a persistent rise tends to affect inflation expectations.",

        "Expectations also fell later in November.",
        "This cycle may repeat, since the uncertainty associated with expectations rose sharply in May 2020 with the onset of Covid-19 and has remained high since.",
        "These aspects and the June softening in inflation momentum indicate it is better to wait and watch inflation, inflation expectations and growth outcomes.",
        "Inflation has been above target for many months but the rise is due to multiple supply shocks associated with the prolongation of Covid-19.",
        "Sustained rise above the tolerance band has not yet exceeded the three quarters time given to the MPC.",
        "The reputation and responsiveness of an inflation targeting regime, as well as supply-side support from the government, may be adequate to prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations despite these multiple shocks.",
        "Therefore, I vote for status quo on the repo rate and policy stance.",
        "Whenever normalization starts, it should be very gradual and aligned to growth recovery and inflation paths.",
        "Since stance affects only repo rate actions, other MPC does not vote on liquidity actions.",
        "In 2009 it was decided to first reduce excess liquidity and this is what markets expect.",
        "But in its normalization, the US Fed stopped helping recovery.",
        "Since excess liquidity is absorbed at the reverse repo, M3 growth cannot be excessive unless demand revives.",
        "A rise in the price of money can restrain its growth.",
        "The definition of the stance is consistent with some durable liquidity surplus continuing in a tight/neutral stance.",
        "India had excessively tight financial conditions in much of the past decade.",
        "Some slack is required to lubricate the economy so payments percolate to low income segments.",
        "Banks are now unable to adequately supply the needs of an increasingly diverse financial sector, so schemes targeting liquidity to different sectors need to continue.",
        "Moreover, India is subject to large negative liquidity shocks from rise in currency holding, government cash balances and foreign capital outflows[1].",
        "Surplus durable liquidity can help to absorb and counter these, especially as the US Fed exits accommodation.",
        "Some G-SAP support may also have to continue until fiscal consolidation is adequate.",
        "But this consolidation is happening faster than expected as tax revenues are buoyant.",
        "Despite a rise in short-rates, long-term spreads may still fall with less than anticipated government borrowing and as there is more conviction on the inflation target.",
        "Government cash balances are already large.",
        "If, however, expected inflation raises G-secs rates by 1%, and the public debt GDP ratio is about 100%, government interest payments will rise by 1% of GDP.",
        "Compared to that, a cut in fuel taxes would sacrifice about 0.5% of GDP in revenues and have many other benefits such as anchoring inflation expectations, reviving demand as well as enabling a fair sharing of the burden of oil price shocks.",
        "In the last several meetings, my statements have expressed the belief that the balance of risk and reward is in favour of monetary accommodation.",
        "As the pandemic continues to mutate, it appears to me that the balance of risk and reward is gradually shifting, and this merits a hard look at the accommodative stance.",
        "First, Covid-19 is beginning to look more and more like tuberculosis which kills a very large number of people every year without inflicting major damage to the economy; in other words, it is beginning to resemble a neutron bomb.",
        "The ability of monetary policy to mitigate a human tragedy of this nature is very limited as compared to its ability to contain an economic crisis.",
        "Related to this is the lengthening of the time horizon of the pandemic.",
        "Global experience (particularly countries like Israel which are witnessing rising case counts despite very high levels of vaccination) suggests that vaccination is insufficient to stamp out the pandemic though it might reduce its severity.",
        "The possibility that Covid-19 will haunt us (though monetary policy highly accommodative for such a long horizon is very different from doing so for what was earlier expected to be a relatively short crisis.",
        "Second, monetary policy has very broad effects on the entire economy, and this was appropriate in the early phase of the pandemic which caused generalized economic distress.",
        "More recently, however, the ill effects of the pandemic have been concentrated in narrow pockets of the economy.",
        "At the industry level, contact intensive services have suffered heavily, while many other industries are now operating above pre-Covid levels.",
        "At the firm level, MSMEs have suffered severely, while large businesses have prospered.",
        "At the household level, the pandemic has been devastating for weaker sections of the society, while the affluent have weathered it reasonably well.",
        "Geographically also, the pandemic has done its worst damage in around 100-200 districts spread across a relatively small number of states.",
        "Monetary policy is much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief to the worst affected segments of the economy.",
        "Indeed, monetary accommodation appears to be stimulating asset price inflation to a greater extent than it is mitigating the distress in the economy.",
        "Third, inflationary pressures are beginning to show signs of greater persistence than anticipated earlier.",
        "There are indications that inflationary expectations may be becoming more widely entrenched.",
        "Most worrying of all, there is now a reduced degree of confidence that demand side inflationary pressures would remain quiescent.",
        "After averaging above 6% in 2020-21, inflation is forecast to be well above 5% in 2021-22, and is not expected to drop below 5% even in the first quarter of 2022-23 according to RBI projections.",
        "While there is some comfort that inflation is forecast to be below the upper end of the tolerance band, it is important to emphasize that the inflation target for the MPC is 4% and not 6% or even 5%.",
        "The tolerance band is designed to allow for forecast errors, implementation shortfalls and measurement issues.",
        "Treating 5% as the target would significantly increase the risk of inflation targeting failures.",
        "(While I have seen some commentary suggesting that there may be a case for raising the inflation target during the pandemic, that decision clearly lies with the government and not with the MPC.)",
        "In this context, I believe that the current level of the reverse repo rate is no be restricted to the policy rate or the repo rate.",
        "Unfortunately, the monetary policy statement of this meeting (as in the past several meetings) contains the line: fall within the remit of the MPC, then the announcement of this rate should be in the favour with the rest of the MPC.",
        "Hence, I have no choice but to express my disagreement with the level of the reverse repo rate.",
        "A gradual normalization of the width of the corridor is warranted.",
        "In my view, a phased normalization of the corridor would increase the ability of the MPC to keep the repo rate at 4% for a longer period, and this should in my view be a greater priority for the MPC than maintaining an ultralow reverse repo rate for some more time.",
        "At a time when the economic recovery is still nascent, it is extremely important that monetary policy serves as an anchor of macroeconomic stability.",
        "That would reduce the inflation risk premium as well as the term premium and help stabilize long term interest rates.",
        "As I have argued in my past statements, a low long term interest rate is more important for inducing an investment led growth than a low short term rate.",
        "In this light, I fear that the forward guidance and monetary stance are becoming counter productive.",
        "By creating the erroneous perception that the MPC is no longer concerned about inflation and is focused exclusively on growth, the MPC may be inadvertently aggravating the risk that inflationary expectations will be disanchored.",
        "In that scenario, rising risk premia could cause long term rates to rise.",
        "Easy money today could lead to high interest rates tomorrow.",
        "On the other hand, by demonstrating its commitment to the inflation target with tangible action, the MPC will be able to anchor expectations, reduce risk premia, and sustain lower long term interest rates for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery.",
        "For these reasons, I am not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and vote against the accommodative stance.",
        "On the other hand, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 4% for the following reasons.",
        "Economic growth was unsatisfactory long before the pandemic, and even if the economic ill effects of the pandemic abate to some extent, substantial monetary accommodation is warranted.",
        "Persistent high inflation means that the monetary accommodation has to be somewhat restrained, and, therefore, I argued above for raising money market rates towards the repo rate of 4% from the current ultra-low l l f 3 35% Th t f 4% d t ti l t i th is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral.",
        "Needless to say, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future.",
        "The policy trade-offs that I highlighted at the June MPC meetings are no less relevant today.",
        "However, the policy balance needs to be reviewed after appraising the recent information on inflation and growth.",
        "The trepidation reflected in my June MPC statement, when I stated that the risks of breaching the upper tolerance level are not insignificant, materialised in its dreaded form when May inflation data was released in June.",
        "There were three important facets of that data.",
        "First, the headline inflation crossed the upper tolerance level, raising the prospects that inflation could stay above the tolerance band for most normal for the month.",
        "Third, price increases were generalised across commodities that month.",
        "Of the 299 commodities for which item-level price data is made available by NSO on a monthly basis, as many as 240 commodities witnessed price increase during the month, which was the highest ever for the flexible inflation targeting period.",
        "The latest available CPI numbers for June released in July, however, turned out to be antithetical, telling a very different story.",
        "First, the headline inflation surprised on the downside and stayed at 6.3 per cent with price levels dropping for several groups.",
        "It showed that May price spike may have been caused by fresh have been biased upwards contaminated by data collection difficulties.",
        "Second, the momentum in June with a m-o-m increase of just 0.56 per cent was distinctly below the average momentum seen for the month.",
        "Third, the general increase in prices seen in May did not sustain in June and fewer items witnessed price increases during the month than is witnessed on an average.",
        "Moreover, the momentum in WPI that was exceptionally high during February-April 2021 has also receded during May-June 2021 reducing the risks of high passthrough ahead by producers to consumers at a retail level.",
        "Interpreting inflation trends have turned difficult with these mixed trends and some fuzziness in data.",
        "However, going forward, three considerations are important.",
        "First, in terms of baseline forecast, post the correction in price levels witnessed in June, inflation is projected to stay above the target, but within the tolerance bands.",
        "Second, with inflation averaging 6.23 per cent since December 2019 and breaching the upper tolerance level in 13 of those 19 months, inflation persistence remains a concern even though the supply-side shock in May could have large transitory component.",
        "Even though the nature of inflation is cost-push, persistence of inflation is worrisome, especially as inflation expectations are getting impacted partly by the adaptive expectations but also in part due to inertial element in this inflation that needs to be closely watched.",
        "The third aspect, that can have an overriding consideration in policy decision at hand, is that this inflation is not from the demand side.",
        "Aggregate demand remains sub-normal and fragile.",
        "The extended price pressures are emanating from second round effects of a very large cost-push shock which to a sizable part has been passthrough from global commodity prices across duty on petrol and diesel was hiked by 44 per cent and 69 per cent, respectively and has not been reversed in face of fiscal constraints.",
        "Model based estimates suggest adding to cost push inflation.",
        "Growth recovery remains fragile accentuated by the dent caused by the second wave and continued uncertainties about pandemic driven by distance to herd immunity and virus mutations.",
        "Risks that recovery can falter ahead remain on number of counts.",
        "First, at the start of our meetings, cumulative rainfall deficiency in monsoon, has been just 1 per cent.",
        "However, the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon this season has been sub-par.",
        "While sowing deficiency that was large in early July has been largely bridged, some adverse impact on yields and outturn can emerge.",
        "These risks can magnify if climate changes cause a repeat of weather disruptions as has often happened of late with unseasonal rains affecting some horticulture crops.",
        "Second, the IIP in Q1 of 2021-22 is likely to remain below the prepandemic average for fiscal year 2019-20 as is already known to be the case for the output level of eight core industries with its June levels still 3.8 per cent below the pre-pandemic fiscal year average for 2019-20.",
        "Third, the high frequency indictors also have similar story.",
        "Over two-thirds of high frequency indicators remain below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Fourth, services sector is particularly vulnerable.",
        "Services PMI at 45.4 in July remains in contraction zone implying two months after the second wave, services activity is still perceived to be falling m-o-m. Fifth, informal sector particularly requires policy support, with emerging evidence of added scaring from the second wave.",
        "Sixth, capacity utilization rates are still abysmally low with OBICUS seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation rate of 67.6 per cent in Q4 not only being markedly lower than the long-term average (from start of the survey in Q1:2008-09 till the pre-pandemic period ending Q4:2019-20) of 74.6 but is also below the all-time pre-pandemic low.",
        "In Q1:2021-22, the second wave of Covid-19 infections would have again brought the capacity utilisation rates further down from this low as is also the indication from the Industrial Outlook Survey.",
        "It is not unusual for central banks to set policies based more on current conditions than forecasts in times of crisis or extreme uncertainties.",
        "Currently, risk of policy errors on either side remains given the large uncertainty on growth and inflation as well as policy trade-offs attached to it.",
        "Relying exclusively on forwardlooking policies increases these risks, especially with extant wide probability distribution attached to inflation forecasts and lack of good information on distributional aspects of growth that affects the bottom of the pyramid disproportionately, the importance of which I explained in my last MPC statement.",
        "Inflation is currently elevated above target and as a baseline is expected to recede.",
        "However, the probability distribution of the projections over a one-year horizon, as provided in the resolution fan charts, even at 50 per cent confidence level leaves the possibility of inflation breaching the upper tolerance level or falling below the lower tolerance level.",
        "In these circumstances, policy can respond with agility should need arise.",
        "If newer supply-side disturbances or elongation of imported commodity price inflation occurs it can impel a reassessment.",
        "However, currently these risks seem to have diminished, though not waned, with Kharif sowing deficiency getting bridged and global commodity price cycle showing signs of thawing on back of anticipated cyclical slowdown of the Chinese economy and possibility that the US economy, dented by the third wave, may not overheat.",
        "On the other side, the possibility of prolonged disinflationary impulse on back of sustained demand weakness cannot be ruled out altogether.",
        "Getting the timing and sequence of policy change wrong and inviting policy reversals later can result in costly increase in output and inflation volatility.",
        "Therefore, at this stage status quo would be better option awaiting further clarity from near-term incoming data.",
        "Changing repo rate at this stage will not be effective and apt from sequencing viewpoint.",
        "So, I vote for keeping repo rate unchanged and continuing the accommodative stance.",
        "Policy focus to revive growth on a durable basis needs to continue and should entail consideration to avoid inflation risks that may emanate when credit demand improves, likely ahead of output gap closing.",
        "This arduous task needs to be carried without endangering sustainable recovery in growth.",
        "Narrative economics plays an important role in difficult times as even animal spirits are characterised by fat tails and can produce endogenous business cycle movements.",
        "However, averting markets becoming opiated to slush liquidity designed as temporary crisis measure is critical to facilitate unwinding when the time comes.",
        "Gradual adjustments that are non-disruptive are possible within the accommodative stance.",
        "Therefore, I vote with the resolution.",
        "With infections plateauing and vaccination underway on a national scale, people are stepping out of isolation and workplaces are filling up.",
        "Power consumption is recovering, freight traffic has shown pandemic-proofing, air travel is rebounding, and all payment modes have registered an uptick in volumes.",
        "In my opinion, these indicators are foretelling a revival of business and consumer confidence.",
        "This window must be utilised to reinvigorate the interrupted recovery even while preparing for a possible third wave.",
        "Absorptive capacity of the economy is rising again, and this is reflected in higher imports and utilisation of capital flows from abroad to supplement domestic saving and push up the investment rate - gross capital formation has risen to 31.3 per cent in January-March 2021, with two-thirds of net foreign capital inflows received by India during that quarter being absorbed domestically.",
        "Yet, even as nearterm prospects have brightened, aggregate demand conditions are taking more time to heal.",
        "Amidst the extreme uncertainty encircling the path of the pandemic, monetary policy authorities have sought to impart some certainty by a commitment to a stance of accommodation extending into the future.",
        "With the upsurge of inflation worldwide, this effort to anchor expectations is under scrutiny.",
        "In some countries, markets have warrant a change in the policy stance.",
        "In others, central banks have pre-emptively edge dilemma and responding to it, in my view, involves a judgment call that puts both foresightedness and inflation fighting credibility on the line.",
        "My vote in this meeting is to maintain the policy rate at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as adopted so far.",
        "In my view, monetary policy has an inherently domestic orientation and the stance of policy is predominantly shaped by country-specific exigencies.",
        "In India, my assessment is that headline inflation may persist at current elevated levels at least through the second quarter of 2021-22 before easing in the third quarter when the _kharif harvest arrives in markets.",
        "There_ are demand-supply mismatches as in the case of protein-rich food items, edible oils and pulses which are being addressed by specific supply measures and there are core inflation may remain stubborn for longer due to disruptions caused by the pandemic, overlaid with increases in margins and taxes.",
        "The high flux in elevated international crude prices remains a risk to inflation and to the terms of trade.",
        "It is important to cushion the economy from this volatility through policy interventions.",
        "The economy is struggling to regain the momentum that had gathered in the second half of 2020-21.",
        "As mentioned earlier, a solidly entrenched increase in aggregate demand is yet to take shape.",
        "Although it seems meaningful to compare progress with a pre-pandemic year, it needs to be noted that in 2019-20, a cyclical downturn had matured over 2 and a half years, taking down real GDP growth to its lowest in the 2011-12 based series of national accounts.",
        "Thus, there is substantial slack in resource utilisation in the economy which needs to be drawn in to get economic activity back to normalcy.",
        "The highest priority now is to revive growth along a sustainable trajectory that becomes compatible with the inflation target as the pandemic recedes.",
        "The price that has to be paid for this policy choice is inflation in the upper reaches of but within the tolerance band in this exceptional, pandemic ravaged year of 2021-22, as against the overshoot above the upper tolerance band in 2020-21.",
        "So far, inflation outcomes are tracking this projected path.",
        "Since the outbreak of the pandemic, all the meetings of the MPC have been held under challenging circumstances.",
        "This one was no less, given the nuancing as there is a sharp spike in inflation almost across the globe.",
        "The MPC has prioritised revival of growth and mitigation of the impact of the pandemic while ensuring that inflation expectations remain anchored, as its guiding principle.",
        "Last year, when inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, our assessment pointed to exogenous and largely temporary supply shocks driving the inflation process.",
        "Under these conditions, the MPC decided to moderate irrational expectations building up at that time of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance through time-specific guidance.",
        "The MPC took a call to look through the supply shocks driven inflation and sought a convergence of expectations all around that monetary policy would continue to remain accommodative in support of growth and not respond to the supply side pressures on inflation.",
        "In hindsight, our prognosis turned out to be correct as inflation ebbed to around 4.1 per cent by January 2021 and was at an average of 4.9 per cent in Q4:2020-21.",
        "The forward guidance given during October-February 2020-21 was helpful in anchoring market expectations; navigating the recovery from the crisis; and strengthening the pace of monetary policy transmission.",
        "The resurgence in inflation in May and June above the upper threshold has reignited the debate on the appropriate monetary policy response.",
        "The gains in monetary policy credibility since the adoption of inflation targeting have helped the MPC to respond effectively to growth-inflation trade-offs posed by an exceptional shock like the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework allows adequate flexibility to the MPC to deal with unanticipated shocks to the takes approach, bolstered by careful guidance on all aspects in the conduct of monetary policy, has been an important facilitator for the cusp of recovery that we are witnessing at the present juncture.",
        "Our own assessment of the resurgence in inflation in India since the June 2021 policy is that it is driven largely by adverse supply-side drivers impinging on food, fuel and core groups due to multifarious disruptions caused by the pandemic.",
        "Many of current price shocks are likely to be one-off or transitory.",
        "Weak demand conditions and low pricing power are limiting the extent of their pass-through to output prices.",
        "The inflation forecast given by the MPC shows that headline inflation will economy is slowly returning back to normalcy from the biggest shock in 100 years.",
        "that the size of the economy in 2021-22 will be moderately higher than 2019-20.",
        "There is still considerable slack in the economy.",
        "Domestic demand is picking up, but at a slow pace.",
        "Several supply side measures have been taken by the Government to deal with the inflationary pressures; however, more needs to be done.",
        "The daily new COVID-19 infections are sticky at around 40,000 cases per day.",
        "Possibility of a third wave looms somewhere in the horizon.",
        "On the whole, the economy still requires support in terms of maintaining congenial financial conditions and fiscal boosters.",
        "At such a critical juncture, can we really pull the rug and the let the economy tumble?",
        "The need of the hour is twofold: first, continue the monetary policy support to the economy; and second, remain watchful of any durable inflationary pressures and sustained price momentum in key components so as to bring back the CPI inflation to 4 per cent over a period of time in a non-disruptive manner.",
        "Managing the economy and the financial markets since the beginning of the pandemic has thrown up several challenges with crosscurrents and conflicting objectives.",
        "Under such circumstances, macroeconomic policies have to be carefully nuanced by making judicious policy choices.",
        "Continued policy support with a focus on revival and sustenance of growth is indeed the most desirable and judicious policy option at this moment.",
        "I, therefore, vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as spelt out by the MPC in its June 2021 meeting.",
        "In parallel, close monitoring of the inflation dynamics will have to continue so as to anchor the inflation expectations.",
        "The twenty seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from February 3 to 5, 2021.",

        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent.",
        "- The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "The global economic recovery slackened in Q4 (October-December) of 2020 relative to Q3 (July-September) as several countries battle second waves of COVID-19 infections, including more virulent strains.",

        "of 50 per cent.",
        "After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020), CPI inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in December on the back of easing food prices and favourable base effects.",
        "Food inflation collapsed to 3.9 per cent in December after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three months (September-November) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside supply side interventions.",
        "On the other hand, core inflation, i.e.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December with marginal moderation from a month ago.",
        "softened further over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations, however, remained unchanged.",
        "Systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in December 2020 and January 2021, engendering easy financial conditions.",
        "Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y-o-y (on January 29, 2021), led by currency demand.",
        "Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent end-March 2020.",
        "With the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in December bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory will shape the near-term outlook.",
        "The bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the months ahead.",
        "On the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses, edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure.",
        "Furthermore, there could be increased pass-through to output prices power.",
        "International crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus.",
        "The crude oil futures curve has become downward sloping since December 2020.",

        "The MPC notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated.",
        "Pump prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs.",
        "An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures.",

        "The recent data suggests that the incidence of new infections has declined.",
        "However, the experience in several countries suggests that there is need to be cautious on this score and the decline in new infections and mortality cannot be taken for granted, especially in view of the new strains of the Corona virus.",
        "Availability of vaccines has provided much needed confidence that the pandemic would give way to restoration of normal economic life, even if gradually.",
        "The ongoing recovery, based on the perceptions of decline of new infections, will require all measures to sustain this decline in reality.",

        "The MPC must of course continue to be data driven and must continue to monitor future developments carefully.",
        "The MPC call to hold policy rates despite inflation staying elevated above the upper tolerance level during H2 of 2020 was based on the assessment that inflation will recede going forward.",
        "This was a difficult call given the observed persistence in inflation.",

        "Given the long and variable transmission lags, we now need to focus on carefully assessing not just the baseline inflation trajectory but also the risks to it, the nature of inflation and its internals going forward.",

        "From the DCA data till January it looks that food prices are at near bottom and though they may start firming up from Q1:2021-22 with some price build up aided partly from firming food and non-food international commodity prices, high food inflation like last year is unlikely to 2 See Goyal, Ashima and Parab Prashant 2020.",

        "However, cost-push increases may come from higher crude oil prices that will feed into costs, especially fertiliser prices and as they get factored in MSPs.",
        "Second, some upside risk to inflation comes from core inflation stickiness and its persistence at elevated levels that may make the task of keeping the headline at the 4 per cent target a challenging one.",
        "There is evidence that firms are able to pass on cost push increases by raising retail prices.",
        "Early corporate results for Q3:2020-21 suggests that margins are rising steeply in automobiles and components, metals, chemicals, capital goods, health care services, telecommunication and real estate.",
        "Not all of this is through cost saving.",
        "Price hikes have been reported in items of iron ore, steel, automobiles, yarn, textiles, chemical and chemical products, rubber products besides oilseeds and edible oils, some of which may get reflected in next three months in WPI and CPI indices.",
        "Mineral oil prices have also witnessed increases.",
        "There is a significant probability that global oil prices may turn out to be markedly higher than the current prevailing prices given the possibility of a large US dollar depreciation this year and signals sent last month by the largest OPEC oil producer by announcing additional supply restraint.",
        "Even though the relationship between dollar movements and oil prices has relatively weakened in recent years, the large dollar invoicing of global commodities trade can not only cause an upswing in commodity prices but through financial market interdependencies may cause ripple effects in asset prices, inflation and business cycles.",
        "Effect on equities of changes in global nominal and real bond yields and financial market spillovers to EMEs may particularly cause macroeconomic shifts.",
        "How the challenges of trilemma amid capital flow volatility are handled with less than corner solutions will influence the monetary policy and inflation outcomes, though a weaker dollar ceteris paribus also means stronger rupee, which will somewhat offset the effect of firmer global oil prices.",
        "However, one can draw considerable comfort from the fact that the core inflation stickiness is embedded in our baseline projections and fully accounts for the trend in momentum.",
        "Also, empirical exercises suggest that while the passthrough from 1 per cent change in WPI non-food manufactured products inflation to CPI core goods inflation is likely to be about 0.20 per cent, the passthrough is much less for overall CPI core inflation and even lesser to headline CPI inflation.",
        "However, this passthrough is time varying and depends on output gap.",
        "When IIP output gap is positive, the passthrough on an average is about double that when it is negative.",
        "Though strong momentum in core goods CPI has taken its inflation to 6.9 per cent, some solace comes from the fact that ex-gold, petrol.",
        "diesel and liquor, the core goods inflation is only at 4.9 per cent.",
        "Also, as contact services may take long to normalise, core services inflation is unlikely to surge in near term.",
        "So, as of now the risks of headline inflation coming back are, therefore, contained in line with our projections.",
        "So, let me turn to growth.",
        "I will just make two points.",
        "First, faster than anticipated, most manufacturing and rural high frequency indicators have already normalised past pre-pandemic levels.",
        "However, services sector indicators such as commercial vehicle sales, registration of transport vehicles, three-wheeler sales, domestic and international air passenger traffic, international cargo, railway passenger traffic, retail and recreation and foreign tourist arrivals are languishing much below those levels.",
        "Second, hysteresis is visible to some degree with anecdotal evidence of some micro-enterprises and informal unincorporated household enterprises having permanently closed production shops.",
        "Quantitative estimates using a range of methods show that even without further disruptions, output gap is unlikely to close before 3Q:2021-22 and more likely only by the end of the next fiscal year.",
        "As growth is still fragile, support to it need to be extended into Q1:2021-22 and longer if necessary, though with risk of a re-calibration in some scenarios such as one in which core inflation momentum picks up further.",
        "Since this is not the baseline and the announced exit dates for various measures are planned at a very gradual pace, the process of change in policy can be non-disruptively achieved.",
        "In my October statement, I had stated that as fiscal authorities have a first mover advantage in the game of chickens, monetary policy will naturally have to factor this to avert Nash equilibria.",
        "With the second successive year of very large gross market borrowing, this is even more important.",
        "Monetary policy will need to lean against the wind to keep interest rates low to the extent possible.",
        "If central bank open market operation purchases are moderate, it entails the risk of crowding out of private investment; if they are large, it carries risk of reengineering inflation.",
        "However, with capacity utilisation rate currently at 63 per cent in Q2:2020-21 and likely to be about 70 per cent by end of the year, capex funding need of private sector are currently limited and the monetaryfiscal coordination to support a larger public investment that can crowd-in private investment can work so long as it is followed by an unflinching commitment to strong fiscal consolidation thereafter.",
        "In conclusion, going forward, while efforts should continue to extend output expansion and close output gap, a necessary concomitant for monetary policy is to secure price stability.",
        "With headline inflation having already corrected as supply shocks have substantially faded, keeping inflation around the target is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fortify and sustain growth.",
        "In my statement, I have focussed more on risks than the baseline.",
        "In my view, the baseline is still consistent with supporting growth through accommodative policy stance in near term.",
        "Therefore, I vote to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "I also vote for retaining the accommodative stance and accompanying forward guidance.",
        "Macroeconomic configurations have shifted and brightened the outlook.",
        "Estimates/projections indicate that GDP growth may have attained positive territory in the second half of 2020-21, mainly on the back of a surge in government expenditure but contractions in private consumption spending are also easing and net exports are finally emerging out of a long retrenchment.",
        "Foreign investment flows are already scenting the imminent upturn.",
        "On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities are clearly demonstrating resilience in the face of the pandemic, and manufacturing activity is gradually limping back to growth on the back of recovery in sales.",
        "This is also evident in rising capacity utilization.",
        "With stronger demand conditions and still moderate costs, operating profits are improving across the board.",
        "Some categories of services such as information technology, construction, real estate, finance, domestic trade and transport are slowly healing from the deep scars left by the virus but several other categories of services remain deeply wounded due to their contact-intensity.",
        "Consumer and business confidence is either cautiously returning to expansion or already in it.",
        "These developments vindicate the stance of monetary policy.",
        "The most heartening feature of the recent shifts is the large fall in inflation, taking it closer to the target after 6 months of persisting outside the tolerance band.",
        "If the sharp disinflation in vegetable prices extends into the spring, headline inflation can ease further, empowering the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Meanwhile, mending of supply chains and normalization of activity is underway, especially recouping of lost incomes by both households and businesses, and that is keeping mark-ups and blue-collar wages elevated.",
        "It is worthwhile to note that households have current inflation perceptions and expectations three months ahead have declined, those for a year ahead remain flat amidst considerable uncertainty.",
        "Upside risks to the outlook for inflation persist.",
        "First, core inflation remains stubborn and will warrant close monitoring as it has the potential to render the recent fortuitous improvements in the macroeconomic outlook stillborn.",
        "Second, rising international commodity prices are being watched the world over with concern as heralding the return of inflation.",
        "For India, the relentless hardening of international crude prices is worrisome, especially as their impact on inflation is amplified by disproportionately high excise duties.",
        "Third, crude and other commodity prices are translating into higher inputs costs, especially in an environment in which demand is recovering.",
        "Pricing power could gain bite as normal demand flows gather traction.",
        "Fourth, the flush of capital flows favouring emerging market economies, including India, has imparted volatility to asset prices and increased the risks of imported inflation.",
        "Overall, the near-term outlook for inflation appears less risky than the near-term challenges for growth which warrant continuing policy support, at least until the elusive engine of investment fires and consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand in India, stabilizes.",
        "Tradeoffs facing the conduct of monetary policy may become sharper in the near-term, however.",
        "First, shocks to economic activity from the winding down of exceptional pandemic measures will have to be balanced against the persuasive incentive to continue with them but with the risk of becoming immobilized in liquidity traps.",
        "Second, concerns about financial stability have risen.",
        "The recent new highs scaled by equity markets could be driven by irrational exuberance; it is difficult to tell in an environment of exceptionally low interest rates all around, large corporate profits but still no capex to write home about, and high levels of market borrowings.",
        "Banks have stronger capital could intensify as the camouflage of moratorium, asset classification standstill and restructuring fades.",
        "Capital infusion and innovative ways of dealing with potential loan delinquencies need to occupy the highest policy attention so that the embryonic recovery in credit growth can be nurtured into a more durable trajectory that also fuels the macroeconomic recovery.",
        "Strong complementarities are emerging between financial and macroeconomic stability.",
        "The best results will obtain when monetary policy ensures that the nominal anchor is firmly moored.",
        "Against this backdrop, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and for maintaining the accommodative stance of policy.",

        "These outcomes, along with the sharp reduction in COVID-19 infections in the country and the rollout of the vaccination programme, have brightened the outlook even though some uncertainties remain.",
        "The Union Budget 2021-22 has given further impetus through a qualitative shift in expenditure which will boost overall investment with multiplier effects on growth.",
        "Foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment to India have surged in recent months, reposing faith in an impressive recovery of the Indian economy.",
        "On the global economy front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its January 2021 update, has revised upward its projection of global growth for 2021 which augurs well for our external demand and exports.",

        "Around 90 per cent of this fall in headline inflation in December was on account of sharp movement of vegetables into double-digit deflation as prices crashed from highly elevated levels supported by robust winter arrivals and favourable base effect.",
        "This trend is likely to be further buttressed by an expected bumper _kharif_ harvest and the rising prospects of a good _rabi crop.",
        "Further softening in food_ price pressures that are currently seen in pulses, edible oils, spices, and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December, due to inflationary impact of rising crude oil prices and high indirect tax rates on petrol and diesel, and pick-up in inflation of key goods and services, particularly in transport and health categories.",

        "Going ahead, market participants need to factor in the forward guidance with respect to the two-phase normalisation of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which opens up space for a variety of market operations to inject additional liquidity through instruments like open market operations (OMOs), among others.",
        "Consistent with the accommodative stance of the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank remains committed to ensure the availability of ample liquidity in the system to foster congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction.",
        "Growth, although uneven, is recovering and gathering momentum, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country.",
        "The growth momentum, however, needs to strengthen further for a sustained revival of the economy and for a quick return of the level of output to the pre-COVID trajectory.",
        "The sharp correction in food inflation has improved the near-term headline inflation outlook, although core inflation pressures persist.",
        "Given the sharp moderation in inflation along with a stable near-term outlook, monetary policy needs to continue with the accommodative stance to ensure that the recovery gains greater traction and becomes broad-based.",

        "Some of these differences in the nature of economic recovery are reflected in the present uneven pattern of growth.",
        "While return to the pre-pandemic level of economic activity is to be expected when the restrictions on the supply side are liberalised, pace of this return to normalcy would depend on the factors affecting supply as well as demand.",
        "On the supply side, in the presence of adequate demand, expansion may be constrained by the supply of inputs, rise in the prices of inputs besides the need for new investments to do business in the new environment.",
        "If the pace of this recovery is slower on the supply side, prices would rise if demand grows more quickly.",
        "If the supply rises more quickly, price rise may be muted, although in both the cases, the exogenous price shocks from the external sector including crude oil and commodity markets impart upside risks to the outlook.",

        "In the case of urban demand, domestic air passenger traffic, passenger vehicles sales and consumer durables sales show divergent trends.",
        "While some of this pattern is related to supply side restrictions (air traffic) or supply chain disruptions (automobile sector), the recovery of overall consumption demand to the pre-pandemic levels is uneven.",

        "But this proportion is lower than the survey results a year back.",
        "The concerns exhibited in the consumer sentiments appear to mirror the assessment of spending more now than a year back, but the improvement is in spending on in unemployment rates and increase in the labour force participation rates in the rural and urban areas from the peak levels seen in May 2021, as brought out by the surveys of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).",

        "Broader recovery in economic activity is reflected in the steady rise in railway freight traffic, pickup in port traffic, air cargo, e-way bills and GST collections.",
        "Non-food credit has continued modest expansion although below the rate of expansion in bank deposits.",
        "The overall trends point to emerging growth momentum, some of it from the relaxation of administrative restrictions imposed in the face of the pandemic as vaccination drive is gaining acceleration across the country and reduction in the number of active cases of infection.",
        "One of the key drivers of the aggregate demand in 2021-22 so far has been the exports, both merchandise and services.",
        "Imports have also increased reflecting pick-up in domestic demand.",
        "Revival of external demand on the back of pick-up of economic growth in the advanced economies has been an important factor supporting export performance.",
        "The supply chain constraints and persistence of pandemic conditions globally, particularly in some of the advanced economies are a concern.",
        "With the present growth momentum, GDP in 2021-22 is expected to exceed the level achieved in 2019-20.",
        "The uneven pace of ongoing recovery across sectors highlights that the protection against the Covid infections through vaccination, practice of Covid appropriate behaviour and availability of health services to mitigate any fresh wave of the infections would be essential to achieve a broad based sustained growth.",
        "Revival of economic growth has also been accompanied by inflationary pressures.",
        "Sources of inflation include price pressures from international markets and also domestic markets.",
        "Restricted supply conditions have added to the price pressures in the domestic markets.",
        "Sharp price increases in a few critical items of production and consumption also have cascading effects.",
        "The present outlook for CPI inflation has been driven by the rise in petroleum fuel prices, and international commodity prices leading to increase in raw material costs, transportation costs and energy costs, even when the recovery in demand conditions has been modest.",
        "The government have helped in reducing the potential impact of price impulses from external markets.",
        "But fuller capacity utilisation, new investments to improve productivity are needed to meet the rising aggregate demand without further price pressures.",

        "Core CPI inflation in June-August 2021 was 5.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent in the same period in 2020.",
        "Besides the spill over effects from food and fuels, core inflation is affected by the prices of transport fuels and transport services that are directly affected by the crude oil price shocks.",
        "Improving efficiency of logistics services and reduction in indirect taxes would play an important role in easing such exogenous shocks on the cost of transport services and overall inflation.",
        "Going forward, external factors such as international commodity prices including petroleum crude would play an important role in the evolution of CPI.",
        "Improved demand conditions would also mean upward pressure on the price front unless supply expands with improved productivity.",
        "The projected CPI inflation rate for Q2, Q3 and Q4 in FY 2021-22 are 5.1, 4.5 and 5.8 per cent, respectively, with an average of 5.3 per cent for FY 2021-22 considering the actual rate of 5.6 per cent for Q1.",
        "This projected inflation rate for 2021-22 is lower by 40 basis points compared to the projected 5.7 per cent in August, still above the target but within the tolerance September 2021 provides a median forecast of 5.3 per cent for FY 2021-22, taking actual rate of 5.6 per cent for Q1.",
        "A clear driver of this decline in projections is the food inflation.",
        "Reduction in the core CPI inflation rate from the present level will require, inter alia, reduction in petroleum fuel prices.",
        "Taking into account the recent trends in output the GDP growth for FY 2021 22 has been retained at 9.5 per cent.",
        "The projections of yoy GDP growth for Q2 have been revised upward from 7.3 per cent in the MPC meeting of August to 7.9 per cent, Q3 from 6.3 to 6.8 per cent, with the Q4 growth remaining unchanged at 6.1 per cent.",

        "The projected moderation in the headline inflation rate and unchanged GDP growth rate for FY 2021-22 reflect improving underlying macroeconomic conditions.",
        "However, in the context of the uncertainties in the external demand and price conditions and an uneven sectoral growth pattern an accommodative monetary policy stance and broader policy support are necessary at this juncture for strengthening the growth momentum and reducing inflation pressures.",
        "Accordingly, I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "We have navigated a difficult year well so far with strong recoveries.",
        "Headline inflation is also softening towards the target.",
        "The theory that temporary Covid-19 related supply shocks are largely responsible for inflation seems to have held out well, although repeated commodity price shocks are an issue.",
        "There is some pass through to other items but it is not generalized as yet.",
        "In addition to oil prices, inflation is higher for electronic goods and consumer durables affected by Covid-19 global shortages and supply chain issues; retail perishables supply chains were able to resolve faster.",
        "Inflation, as well as household and business inflation expectations rose during peak waves and fell thereafter.",
        "Global price shocks have turned out to be more persistent, contributing to sticky core inflation.",
        "Tax cuts on petroleum products are essential to break the upward movement that could impart persistence to domestic inflation.",
        "Government initiatives have contributed to the fall in food inflation.",
        "This, and relative fiscal conservatism, enables monetary policy to remain accommodative, keeping the real interest rate well below the growth rate, stimulating the recovery and reducing public debt ratios.",
        "The transmission to output growth from low real rates combined with surplus liquidity is well established.",
        "Causality is normally from core inflation to headline but this need not be so if rise in core inflation is due to reversible supply shocks.",
        "There is large uncertainty built into current prices because of the speculative element that seeks to profit from aggravated shortages.",
        "Large sudden falls are therefore possible.",
        "Oil prices have shown high volatility.",
        "The climate change activism that is partly responsible for current spikes will also reduce oil demand in the future.",
        "There are signs of container prices softening as exports from China reduce.",
        "Policy has to be data based, since inflation may fall faster than guidance, or supply-side issues may cause new spikes.",
        "Demand is also uncertain beyond pent up demand and the festival season.",
        "Some slowdown in global growth and more surprises from Covid-19 are possible, although vaccination is progressing well.",
        "Data lags mean we do not as yet know the extent of scarring in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), contact intensive services and in employment.",
        "The current situation warrants that monetary-financial conditions remain accommodative.",
        "In times of great uncertainty it is important that policy remains steady and supportive.",
        "Therefore, a pause in the repo rate and an accommodative stance is required and I vote for these.",
        "Even so, policy has to continuously adapt in line with changing circumstances.",
        "Over-stimulus as after the global financial crisis, with delay resulting in sharp adjustment, has to be avoided.",
        "What is the quantity of excess liquidity required?",
        "Large inflows have led to a rise in liquidity over the past two months.",
        "In advanced countries exit normally starts by stopping fresh injections of liquidity although existing levels are only allowed to reduce slowly and naturally as securities mature.",
        "The experience is markets react well to transparent changes in policy rates that follow the data.",
        "For example, if rates rise as growth is well-established, stock markets continue to do well.",
        "India, however, has an informal sector as well as a modern sector that are differently served by existing arrangements for short term liquidity.",
        "Only banks have access to repo and reverse repo windows.",
        "There are also large shocks from foreign flows, government cash balances and currency leakages.",
        "Therefore, liquidity needs to be kept in sufficient surplus to absorb these shocks even as the excess is reduced allowing the reverse repo to rise gradually and arrangements for non-banks remain in place.",
        "A higher fixed reverse repo rate for banks could be linked to raising their i t t t d it t Th ECB h d thi 45.",
        "With some growth recovery, but more to go, and one year ahead inflation expected at about 5%, a real policy rate of about -1% is appropriate.",
        "As the LAF band was widened last year short rates fell much more than long rates.",
        "Spreads widened for 10-year G-secs, although rates fell to their lowest in many years.",
        "Market expectations in current forward rates see short rates rising over the next year with little change in 10-year G-secs rates.",
        "As uncertainty reduces, the inflation target is well internalized, and government borrowing requirements reduce, spreads should fall further.",
        "Long rates are important for investment and as benchmarks for private borrowing.",
        "The yield curve is likely to flatten, although oil price uncertainty is a risk.",
        "India is well placed to absorb any volatility as advanced economy central banks begin their exit or if financial shocks spread from China.",
        "It is important that policy remains aligned to the domestic cycle and any external shocks are smoothed.",
        "Several of the arguments that I made in my August statement continue to be valid, and I will summarize them quickly without repeating the detailed analysis underpinning them.",
        "First, the Covid-19 pandemic has mutated into a human tragedy rather than an economic crisis, and monetary policy is not the right instrument to deal with this.",
        "Second, the ill effects of the pandemic are now concentrated in narrow pockets of the economy, and monetary policy is much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief to the worst affected segments of the economy.",
        "Third, inflationary pressures are beginning to show signs of greater persistence than anticipated earlier.",
        "Since August, I have become increasingly concerned about two other risks that have become salient globally in recent weeks.",
        "The first is that the ongoing transition to green energy worldwide poses a significant risk of creating a series of energy price shocks similar to that in the 1970s.",
        "This means that the upside risks to long term inflation and to inflation expectations are now more aggravated.",
        "My second recent concern is about the tail risk to global growth posed by emerging financial sector fragility in China reminiscent of Japan of the late 1980s.",
        "Both of these risks one to inflation and the other to growth - are well beyond the control of the MPC, but they warrant a heightened degree of flexibility and agility.",
        "A pattern of policy making in slow motion that is guided by an excessive desire to avoid surprises is no longer appropriate.",
        "For these reasons, I am not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and vote against the accommodative stance.",
        "Raising effective money inflation target, help anchor expectations, reduce risk premia, enhance macroeconomic stability, and allow lower long-term interest rates to be sustained for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery.",
        "On the other hand, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 4% for the following reasons.",
        "Economic growth was unsatisfactory long before the pandemic, and even if the economic ill effects of the pandemic abate to some extent, substantial monetary accommodation is warranted.",
        "The repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral.",
        "Needless to say, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future.",
        "Since we last met, real economic activity is on track to gradual normalisation, inflation spike has turned out to be transitory, fiscal position appears to be back on budgetary track and external balance remains under control.",
        "In short, macroeconomic conditions have improved and the economy looks stable.",
        "However, this should not lull us into assuming a goldilocks scenario.",
        "Significant headwinds have started blowing from the shifting global macro-economic conditions.",
        "Rising geopolitical risks complicate the scenario further.",
        "The expectations of a red piping-hot recovery have been belied.",
        "Global growth expectations are getting scaled down on account of likely taper, China slowdown, scaling back of US fiscal stimulus on back of uncertainties surrounding infrastructure bill and debt ceiling and adverse impact on activity of gas and energy shortages in Europe and elsewhere.",
        "These can have significant spillovers and spillbacks running through trade, financial and market expectations channels.",
        "They can alter the domestic macroeconomic balances and cause spells of volatility clustering over a year or more, even though the buffers so assiduously built in the recent past are likely to see the economy through without any growth collapse.",
        "How do we frame monetary policy in the backdrop of the emerging new challenges?",
        "First and foremost, we need to remain data dependent.",
        "Financial markets are characterised by multiple equilibria.",
        "Capital flows can turn volatile in either direction if taper paths come with surprises.",
        "Within the flexible inflation targeting framework, we need to be conscious about exchange rate dynamics originating from exogenous shocks and incorporate those in risks though not in baseline.",
        "Amid these uncertainties, policies will need to respond with alacrity and should be untangled from any pre-commitments.",
        "If at all some guidance is needed at this stage, it has to be a soft one; with the Reserve Bank preparing markets that while policy stance is likely to remain accommodative till growth is revived on a durable basis, liquidity levels will be adjusted dynamically to appropriate lower levels that are still consistent with accommodative stance.",
        "Second, we need to reinforce our commitment to the assigned inflation target guided by data inflows on growth, inflation and other parameters.",
        "The central bank needs to remain committed to goal dependence and instrument independence as it has a statutory foundation and is also consistent with general worldwide practice amongst inflation targeting central banks.",
        "Third, we need now to focus more on risks to both inflation and growth and calibrate policies as the situation evolves.",
        "Considerable uncertainty about output gap in pandemic times remains, with filtering techniques guiding much faster closure than structural models that capture scarring better.",
        "However, in my judgement, if no new disruptions to growth emerge, output gap will close sometime in 2022-23 and monetary policy should start to gradually reposition to lowering underlying inflation and inflation expectations next year, especially if inflation edges up from the energy be kept on commodity prices and we need to consider different scenarios according to which we can calibrate our policies.",

        "After an encouraging sequential improvement in high frequency indicators in July, there was a loss of momentum in August, when only about three-fifths of the indicators registered improvement over the preceding month.",
        "As of now, only about half the indicators have normalised to pre-pandemic levels and only a fifth of indicators to levels achieved in March 2021 before the second wave derailed the normalisation process.",
        "However, the activity levels can normalise faster in H2:2021-22 and reach pre-pandemic levels before fiscal year-end on back of vaccinations ramp-up and considerable re-opening of the economy with removal of most Covid-related movement restrictions.",
        "Investment intentions, as revealed by the phasing details of projects financially assisted by the financial intermediaries or funded through oversees borrowings or equity raising, show investment retrenchment in 2020-21 and a rather weak pipeline for 2021-22 with a 47.5 per cent year-on-year drop.",
        "Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation rate that was at 66.6 per cent in Q4:2020-21 had dipped to 61.7 per cent in Q1:2021-22 marred by the second wave, but the dip was much lower than in the first wave when the rate had dropped to 48.9 per cent.",
        "Investment demand is lagging consumption demand but has started to look up.",
        "Net responses of Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) shows that capacity utilisation rebounded in Q2:2021-22 and further improvement is expected.",
        "While in recent years capex has been essentially led by power and roads, there are signs that true investment may be getting somewhat understated given the recent spurt in intangible investments that are not getting fully reflected in national accounts.",
        "There are also signs that on the back of PLI scheme investment will get more broad-based in near-term.",
        "Monetary policy has already lowered the hurdle rates since 2019-20.",
        "Fiscal policy has cut the effective corporate tax rates by nearly 39 per cent in September the same year.",
        "This means that the user cost of capital has dropped markedly.",
        "However, investment has not responded much till now because of huge pandemic related uncertainty that has affected consumer and business confidence, depressed aggregate demand and posed execution and cash flow difficulties.",
        "Corporates chose to deleverage, and their investment intentions have fallen.",
        "Consumer confidence improved sequentially in Q2:2021-22 but remains gap down compared to normal levels pre-pandemic.",
        "Debt/Equity ratio of corporates has already declined from above 60 per cent in 201516 to around 35 per cent in 2020-21.",
        "Once structural policies work and animal spirits revive on back of reduced uncertainties, investment will turnaround.",
        "In the interim, the current accommodative policy is helping in shoring up consumption demand.",
        "With rising global uncertainties, at this juncture, it important that we preserve macrofinancial stability, so as to be able to nurture growth rebound.",
        "Coming to inflation, while one expects further disinflation in near months, the baseline reverses thereafter despite base effects being moderately on the favourable side.",
        "The momentum is expected to pick up in H2:2021-22 and there are upside risks and stickiness of core that warrant attention.",

        "Unless cooperative solutions are found, the underlying gas shortages in Europe are going to get worse in the winters and as they might enervate climate change commitments.",
        "The increased dependence on fossil fuels can structurally lift energy inflation and its passthrough to general price level.",
        "High imported coal prices are already affecting power generation in some coastal plants in India Chips delivery time has gone up to 21 weeks from 12 weeks in the pre general, supply constraints persist and if demand revives fast, it can add to inflation.",
        "So, managing supply side will be critical.",
        "While there are some signs that price rise broadened during August CPI, the spread is moderate at best and not reflective of generalisation of price rise.",
        "Inflation expectations remain high but are not unanchored solace, further dampening of inflation expectations will be needed as output levels gets normalised.",
        "Interestingly, some recent research from an influential central bank has casted scepticism over long-run inflation expectations being an important factor driving inflation dynamics.",
        "To my view, introducing such new paradigms in monetary policy is playing with fire and carry dangers that central banks will lose control over inflation as the economies recover.",
        "In sum, we have broadly been right in averting premature tightening and allowing economy to recover.",
        "With complementary actions in calibrating liquidity, negative real rates to savers can now be corrected in period ahead.",
        "Considering the above, I vote for keeping the stance unchanged and for keeping policy rate unchanged in line with the resolution.",
        "The assessment made in August 2021 that inflation would ease in the third quarter of 2021-22 has been happily overtaken by actual outcomes in the form of a decline in food inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, specific supply measures are working to address demand-supply mismatches in this category.",
        "With agricultural production prospects looking bright, further easing of food inflation may take down the headline in the third quarter more than initially expected.",
        "On the other hand, the formation of inflation is being buffeted by repeated shocks that have taken fuel inflation to an alltime high and turned core inflation persistent, with risks to the upside.",
        "Accordingly, it is important to remain on guard about second order effects from these transitory perturbations that gives these components of inflation a resistant character by their recurring incidence.",
        "At this time, however, pressures from wages and rentals remain muted.",
        "Staff costs in the organised sector are rising again as hiring and normal work processes resume.",
        "There is also some evidence forming that cost pressures may not be able to be absorbed any longer and selling prices may turn up.",
        "Thus, while the trajectory of inflation may undershoot the projections made in August, it is likely to be uneven, sluggish and prone to interruptions.",
        "Beginning in August, various indicators are suggesting that the economy is negotiating a potential gravitational swing-by from the retarding forces unleashed by COVID-19.",
        "Pre-pandemic levels of output are being sighted.",
        "Agriculture and allied 2019-20 levels; and contact-based services are healing fast.",
        "Exports can become a force multiplier that accelerates the pace of growth.",
        "They provide the avenue for the economy to break out of the limits imposed by the size of the domestic market which is still struggling with pent-up demand becoming more durable.",
        "By the end of September, the half-way mark of an ambitious export target for the year is about to be crossed.",
        "Even as domestic macroeconomic configurations are improving, the risks from global developments are rising and warrant a close watch as they could stifle the recovery that is underway in India.",
        "Exports are directly at risk from logistics bottlenecks, shortages of containers and personnel in international shipping, and are needed urgently to prevent global trade from choking.",
        "More broadly, global growth is losing steam, circumscribing the strength of the recovery with shortages of key intermediates such as chips and semi-conductors.",
        "And inflation is now everywhere and raging, with implications for the revival of consumption demand.",
        "This is precipitating diverse monetary policy actions which are accentuating the fissures in the global economy.",
        "Recent financial developments amidst a sea of froth highlight the excesses of indebtedness and the potential contagion for the real economy, macroeconomic prospects are global and they could materialise suddenly.",
        "In this milieu, I vote to maintain the policy rate and the accommodative stance of policy unchanged, awaiting stronger evidence on demand-led inflationary pressures.",
        "Until then, congenial financial conditions need to be in place.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented crisis, that led to record output and employment losses combined with bouts of financial market volatility and supply disruptions, has rendered the job of central bankers across the globe even more challenging.",
        "In India also, we had to deal with sharp meltdown in growth, rise in inflation and threat to financial stability, all at once.",
        "Given the complexity of the challenges, the policy responses had to be geared not just towards short-term stabilisation, but also to potential long-term implications.",
        "During the last eighteen months, therefore, our priority has been to revive growth and preserve financial stability, even as we remain steadfastly committed to keep inflation closer to the target.",
        "The global economy now is on a more difficult tangent of slowing growth momentum with entrenching inflationary tendencies.",
        "As the classical trade-off that central banks face between slowing growth and higher inflation is getting edgier, their actions have been in response to their domestic macroeconomic circumstances.",
        "As per our assessment, while the recovery is gaining traction and aggregate demand is rebounding, the economy still operates below the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Despite the projected 9.5 per cent GDP growth for 2021-22, there is still slack in the economy as the level of GDP will only be moderately above its pre-COVID level of that the real GDP in Q1:2021-22 was well below the Q1:2019-20 level as well as the Q1:2018-19 level.",
        "We expect to exceed the pre-pandemic level of output only in Q3:2021-22.",
        "The second wave amplified the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on contact-intensive activities and the informal sector.",
        "With increased pace of vaccination, however, contact-intensive activities which were earlier lagging in recovery are now catching up.",
        "Informal sector is likely to take even longer to recoup as the impact of the second wave on this sector was relatively more pronounced.",
        "The remains high partly reflecting persisting weakness in the informal sector.",
        "Durable recovery in manufacturing and services sectors should support revival in the informal economy.",
        "The future trajectory of growth, however, is strewn with many challenges, most notably from how the pandemic will evolve.",
        "Overall, growth remains critically dependent on policy support and needs nurturing for sustained recovery.",
        "In its August 2021 meeting, the MPC was faced with the challenges posed by headline inflation exceeding the upper tolerance threshold for the second successive month.",
        "The MPC then judged the inflation spike during May-June as transitory, driven expected it to ease in the subsequent months.",
        "The actual inflation outcomes for JulyAugust, with inflation registering a substantial moderation to move within the MPC was faced with a similar dilemma in September-October last year due to food price shocks; and its judgement to see them as transitory and to look through it had proved to be right.",
        "Such an approach has been contributing significantly to the economic recovery and stability in the financial markets.",
        "Thus, the medium-term focus of the MPC has successfully moderated undue expectations of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance and is helping anchor expectations in the right direction, while navigating the economic recovery from the crisis.",
        "The more than expected softening of inflation in July and August this year was underpinned by the significant lowering in food price momentum, especially in August.",
        "Several factors have contributed to this.",
        "The summer seasonal vegetable price build-up this year was unusually low, close to a third of historical patterns.",
        "Supply side measures announced by the Government in recent months to meet the demand-supply gaps have helped to stabilise food prices.",
        "Core inflation, _i.e., CPI_ excluding food and fuel, however, remained elevated and sticky primarily on account of persistent inflationary pressures in transport and communication, health, clothing and footwear.",
        "Going forward, if there are no spells of unseasonal rains, food inflation is likely to register significant moderation in the immediate term, aided by record _kharif_ production, more than adequate food stocks, supply-side measures and favourable base effects.",
        "Volatile crude oil prices, particularly the resurgence since midSeptember, is pushing pump prices to new highs, raising risk of further spillover of high transportation cost into retail prices of goods and services.",
        "On balance, the outlook on inflation has improved and inflation projection for 2021-22 has been revised downward by 40 bps to 5.3 per cent.",
        "Against this backdrop, it is felt that continued monetary support is necessary as the economic recovery process even now is delicately poised and growth is yet to take firmer roots.",
        "The external environment, which had been supportive of aggregate demand over the past few months, may lose momentum for a variety of reasons such binding shortage of key inputs like semi-conductors; and the spike in gas prices.",
        "Given an ever evolving and dynamic environment, with the outlook overcast by several uncertainties including the fact that the pandemic is far from over, we need to ensure that the nascent revival of economic activity shows signs of durability and sustainability.",
        "At this critical juncture, our actions have to be gradual, calibrated, welltimed and well-telegraphed to avoid any undue surprises.",
        "We are reaching the shore after sailing through a very turbulent journey, and we cannot afford to rock the boat at this crucial stage.",
        "We must ensure that we reach safely to begin the journey beyond the shore.",
        "I, therefore, vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as spelt out by the MPC in its August 2021 meeting.",
        "In parallel, we remain laser-focused to bring back the CPI inflation to 4 per cent over a period of time in a non-disruptive manner."

        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Since the MPC met in May 2020, global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies.",
        "While the uneasy and differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival.",

        "At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent.",
        "It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May, 2020 require more clarity.",
        "At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) costpush pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges, rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand.",
        "Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels.",
        "Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads.",
        "Financing conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse.",
        "Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy.",
        "unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "Since the last review, the economy has seen a gradual rebound in economic activity.",

        "I therefore vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target, going forward.",
        "After the last MPC meeting in May 2020, changes in the economic environment were along the expected lines except the official announcement about the headline CPI and implicit inflation numbers during April, May and June.",
        "These high inflation prints coupled with the apprehensions about GDP growth likely to be negative both in real terms and nominal terms would imply that the economy is not caught up in recession with deflation but in a deep stagflation, which occurs when the adverse supply shock is more severe than the demand expansion and growth recovery, which is expected under recession with deflation.",
        "I have strong reservations in accepting the implicit inflation numbers for April and May announced by the NSO.",

        "Thus, the imputed CPI and inflation rates implied by them do not seem to be consistent with the alternative measures not only in terms of the magnitude but also in the direction of change.",
        "ii) Moreover, I have been expressing serious concerns over the mismeasurement of inflation in our country (see The Report of the Sixth Central Pay Commission, 2008; and my article in Economic and Political Weekly, Nov.17, 2018) by the fixed baseweighted index with limited number of consumption items instead of the chain-base weighted index method followed in the developed countries.",
        "In an extreme situation created by the nation-wide lockdown for months, the consumption pattern in the country has significantly and substantially changed.",
        "This would simply not be reflected in the measurement of our headline inflation based on the fixed base-weighted index even if all price quotations were available; and would provide an unrealistic measurement of inflation.",
        "iii) Imputation of the headline inflation numbers ignoring all such limitations when used in forecasting models and policy simulation exercises may misrepresent and provide misleading signals.",
        "It is, therefore, prudent to ignore them and wait for more reliable measurements and estimates.",

        "Although the present circumstances are truly exceptional, the primary mandate given to MPC for inflation targeting at 4 percent with the upper tolerance limit of 6 percent has to be respected.",
        "In fact, the confusion and uncertainty created by the imputed CPI-C and implied inflation estimates needs to be cleared by more of regular readings on inflation rates.",
        "Since the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the money, bond and credit markets has been commendable but not complete, there is no harm in taking a pause at this juncture.",

        "Growth estimates for 2020-21 are difficult to arrive at the current juncture, but there could be a downward bias to the present consensus estimates when the final data becomes available.",
        "Inflation, on the other hand, may have an upward bias.",
        "The recovery path is inextricably linked to the course the pandemic might take and complete normalisation will be difficult till pandemic is overcome.",

        "Recovery in GST, including through E-way bills, railway freight, port cargo, cement production and petroleum consumption has been particularly encouraging.",
        "However, with the notable exceptions of electricity and tractors, all other indicators remained in red in June with levels at least 15 per cent below that in February.",

        "Anecdotal evidence from industry sources suggest that activity levels might improve only marginally in July.",
        "This signals that it may be hard to recover the last 10 per cent of the production given that the Covid-19 curve has not flattened yet.",
        "The disruption caused by it will leave hysteresis, implying some permanent damage to potential output even after pandemic recedes, although speedy policy action has contained this impairment.",
        "In these circumstances, the MPC has been rightfully mindful of growth as well within the flexible inflation targeting framework.",
        "It has taken actions with a view to prevent output collapse that could otherwise have had lasting impact.",
        "Inflation statistics in the pandemic period have elements of fuzziness.",
        "Statistical authorities had to resort to imputation method in face of lockdown and had not released the headline inflation for the month of April and May.",

        "However, the June data shows that inflation is above the upper tolerance level when the markets coverage in price statistics had improved to 88 per cent of the usual coverage, up from 52 per cent in April.",
        "Quotations coverage could be relatively lower.",
        "It is not clear if the full coverage would have made a difference to the headline number.",
        "However, the best judgment that I can exercise with available information is that non-monetary factors may have led the headline inflation persisting above the acceptable band for most of the months since December, but monetary factors may also be contributing to the elevated inflation.",
        "Ex-food and fuel, inflation was at 5.4 per cent in June.",
        "However, this core component itself has been driven high by certain elements that may not be contributing to true inflation.",
        "For instance, gold that enters into personal care and effects segment may have contributed about 34 bps to the headline inflation if one were to proximate it by gold prices in the market.",
        "Ex-food, fuel and estimated gold, inflation was likely in the vicinity of 5.1 per cent.",
        "Consumption of gold had dropped but the CPI index is driven by Laspeyres or base-year consumption weights and not Paasche or current consumption weights.",
        "The bias on this count, however, could be non-material as high food inflation may have been accompanied by higher current consumption of food in the overall basket.",
        "The question relevant for the policy is how long food inflation might stay high and are we seeing signs of generalisation.",
        "Food inflation should soften as food stock levels are well above norms, monsoon is shaping normal, reservoir levels are reasonable and kharif sowing has been brisk.",
        "However, the drivers of food inflation include protein-rich food sub-groups and as is evident from retail price data from the Department of Consumer Affairs also Moreover, rise in food prices, even though predominantly caused by supply disruption, runs the risks of generalisation to keep headline inflation higher than is being anticipated.",
        "The incipient signs of generalisation have also been aided by higher excise and VAT on petroproducts.",
        "Higher diesel prices have implications for transportation costs.",
        "Risks to inflation arise from price stickiness and supply chain disruptions, high costs of rebuilding or modifying supply chains and less than competitive markets under lockdowns, translating into higher retail margins.",
        "As such, it remains to be seen how much inflation falls later in the year due to demand destruction, base effects and improved agriculture supplies.",
        "In my view, with considerable policy rate reduction effected since February 2019 and liquidity and credit easing getting frontloaded since March 2020, a breather is necessary awaiting greater clarity.",
        "The transmission of rate cuts has picked up in the preceding quarter.",
        "Liquidity infusions have reduced financial market spreads on corporate paper of various tenors and credit quality, especially of corporate bonds whose issuance has risen.",
        "During July, the All-India financial institutions and Housing Finance Companies have been able to raise money through Commercial Papers at a weighted average rate below the reverse repo rate and corporates and NBFCs at below repo rate.",
        "Further rate reductions may come in the way of smoothening of interest rate movements unless durable reduction in path of inflation materialises.",
        "While markets and fundamentals seldom do a tango, a disconnect between the two carry the risks of disruptive market corrections.",
        "Policy needs to be mindful of the space that may be needed to deal with possibility of increased stress that may resurface later with loan defaults and recognition of bad loans.",
        "Impact of fiscal actions and space also need to be closely observed for demand management.",
        "Growth is at risk over the medium term if we sacrifice macro-financial stability for short-run expediency.",
        "Moreover, there is sound rationale that monetary policymakers should do less under uncertainty.",
        "While pausing, it is best to retain the accommodative stance as long as the baseline suggests that inflation will soften to well within the tolerance band keeping in view the need to avoid frequent directional changes even as policy remains data dependent.",
        "Also, confidence levels are currently fragile and monetary transmission of earlier rate reduction is still in pipeline.",
        "Considering all of above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged and maintaining accommodative stance as communicated in the resolution, that emphasises need for continued support to growth, while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space so as to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "From the time of the outbreak of the pandemic, the setting of monetary policy by the monetary policy committee (MPC) has involved the assignment of a more than proportionate weight to growth relative to inflation.",
        "The severe contractions in various sectors of the economy in the first half of 2020-21 so far vindicate this weighting scheme.",
        "Disappointingly, however, inflation surprises of recent months are undermining the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.",
        "The unanticipated concoction of imputations of the consumer price index (CPI) for April and May 2020, supply disruptions and unrelenting cost push interventions in price formation that have reared up outside the ambit of monetary policy has complicated its conduct, especially as the inflation levitation seems to show persistence.",
        "Amidst the high uncertainty characterising the near-term outlook, two outcomes are possible, drawing from precedents alone.",

        "There is one widely expected to record its deepest contraction in history.",
        "There is also an important lesson They can and do get persistent and generalised into wider macroeconomic instability.",
        "At the current juncture, with inflation prints above the upper tolerance band, technical considerations under the monetary policy framework warrant a pre-occupation with dealing with the conditions of failure.",
        "All this, after a period of four years of uninterrupted success in keeping inflation well within the tolerance band and in fact, closely aligned with the target, which has earned the country credibility in monetary policy conduct, investor confidence and the anchoring of expectations!",
        "Consequently, monetary policy is forced into a standstill even when there is space available to persevere with its commitment to reinvigorate growth momentum and alleviate the effects of COVID-19.",
        "In fact, if inflation persists above the upper tolerance band for one more quarter, monetary policy will be constrained by mandate to undertake remedial action, including an immediate and more than proportionate response to head off the build-up of inflation pressures and prevent it from getting generalised.",
        "The question is: can the economy withstand it in this virus-ravaged, debilitated state?",
        "The MPC has already signalled its concern in its stance by resolving to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "It has also expressed the unanimous view that for the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series.",
        "The outlook is grim; even when it improves, the expectation is one of slow, hesitant recovery, with the situation likely to worsen before it gets better.",
        "The upticks that easing of lockdowns yield are likely to be ephemeral and vulnerable to flattening out due to lack of underlying vigour.",
        "A durable revival of the economy depends on sustained policy support to resuscitate activity in various sectors, restore employment and livelihood to the displaced and dispossessed, continue to assure health support and pursuit of the vaccine, ease financial stresses facing households, businesses and financial intermediaries, instil confidence and anchor financial stability before it slips away.",
        "This underscores the urgency of unshackling monetary policy from extraneous non-pandemic constraints, emerging out of inadequate and lagged reactions in terms of supply management.",
        "In the absence of this coordinated strategy, monetary policy will be left with no option but to adhere to its primary mandate of the MPC, which is after all, achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "At this juncture, therefore, I vote for _status quo on the policy rate.",
        "I reiterate that,_ abstracting from the exogenous shocks to inflation mentioned earlier, the state of the economy warrants that the MPC should continue to maintain its accommodative stance, while ensuring that inflation returns to the target.",

        "Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand.",
        "CPI inflation remained subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and compression in demand amidst lockdowns, while food inflation picked up due to supply disruptions.",
        "Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which has extended over the past two months.",
        "High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments.",
        "Electricity consumption has plunged, while both investment activity and private consumption suffered precipitous declines, as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and non-durables in March.",
        "High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March.",
        "The only silver lining was provided by agriculture, with the summer sowing of rice, pulses and oilseeds in the country progressing well, with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 43.5 per cent so far, and the _rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record_ procurement.",
        "Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, moderated for the second consecutive month in March 2020 to 5.8 per cent after peaking in January.",
        "In April, however, supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the softening of food inflation, which surged to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in March.",
        "Prices of vegetables, cereals, milk, pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as pressure points[1].",
        "The Reserve Bank remained in pro-active liquidity management mode, expanding its array of measures, both conventional and unconventional, to augment system-level liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints.",

        "The inflation outlook is highly uncertain.",
        "As supply lines get restored in the coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown, the unusual spike in food inflation in April is expected to moderate.",
        "The forecast of a normal monsoon also portends well for food inflation.",
        "Given the current global demand-supply balance, international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from the recent depressed levels.",
        "Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms.",
        "Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation (excluding food and fuel), although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook.",
        "However, volatility in financial markets could have a bearing on inflation.",
        "These factors, combined with favourable base effects, are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation below target in Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21.",
        "Turning to the growth outlook, economic activity other than agriculture is likely to remain depressed in Q1:2020-21 in view of the extended lockdown.",
        "Even though the lockdown may be lifted by end-May with some restrictions, economic activity even in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary shortage of labour.",
        "Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives.",
        "For the year as a whole, there is still heightened uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to remain in place and consequently, downside risks to domestic growth remain significant.",
        "On the other hand, upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained, and social distancing measures are phased out faster.",
        "The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated, and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress.",
        "The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression.",
        "Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood and health are severely affected.",
        "Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy, it is necessary to ease financial conditions further.",
        "This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits.",
        "With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdown-related supply disruptions are mended, the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy, even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold.",
        "Accordingly, all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",
        "Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Janak Raj, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps, while Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps.",

        "Several high frequency indicators point to dire growth outcomes in the near the economy.",
        "The economy needs to be opened up smartly.",

        "The main growth challenge is that the top six industrialized COVID.",
        "Despite the dire growth outcomes, why have I voted for a 25 bps cut, and not a larger amount?",
        "_First, it is not entirely clear to me that Covid-19 constitutes a large disinflationary_ shock.",
        "Inflationary pressures fall with economic slack (the output gap), but rise with expected future inflation and factors related to production costs.",
        "Both 3-month ahead and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations have spiked spike reverses a relatively flat trajectory for inflationary expectations over the past six rounds of surveys.",
        "It also reflects a sharp rise in food inflation in recent months.",
        "In April, food inflation rose to 8.6% from 7.8% in March, and will likely remain elevated in the coming months.",
        "I continue to be concerned about declining market arrivals of food commodities because of COVID related supply side bottlenecks and their inflationary impact.",
        "When the economy turns to the upside, the recovery in demand will be swift.",
        "There has already been a severe dislocation in domestic and global supply chains.",
        "It will take some time to for these to get resolved, and it is therefore likely that demand will recover faster than supply.",
        "Currently, core inflation (inflation excluding food and fuel) continues to remain moderate, with the April readings (not released by the CSO) likely to have been similar to the March readings, or around 4%.",
        "Lower oil prices have not been passed on to consumers at the pump because of a sharp hike in Central excise duties and increases in VAT rates on petrol and diesel across States, cancelling out any beneficial effects of lower oil prices on core inflation.",
        "_Second, as I mentioned in the last review, in a demand deficient economy, a_ large rate cut is akin to pushing on a string.",
        "For rate cuts to work, banks have to lend.",
        "Despite the large number of steps taken to improve the liquidity and functioning of credit markets, as of April 24 (the most recent data available), non-food credit growth on a y-o-y basis was at 6.5% on May 8, 28.",
        "_Third, rate cuts should be seen as part other measures that have already been_ taken with respect to liquidity policy, social insurance policy, and fiscal policy in dealing with the crisis.",
        "Since the last review, a comprehensive fiscal stimulus has been announced, part that increases discretionary spending via fiscal policy is however around 1% of GDP.",
        "An ambitious Keynesian fiscal stimulus was always going to have to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis: if the government spent too much on the discretionary part of the stimulus, the yield curve would have gotten thrashed, banks would have booked losses, and our credit rating would have gotten a downgrade.",
        "It would have also signalled that the government is giving up on its commitment to controlling inflation.",
        "If it spent too little, it risked a worsening of growth.",
        "To navigate the middle path, the government has focussed on much needed structural reforms.",
        "The measured approach to the stimulus recognizes the government cannot spend its way to prosperity without implications for financial instability.",
        "Despite the small Keynesian component of the stimulus however, taking into account the relaxation in state government borrowing limits, the combined state-centre markets will shrug this off.",
        "That means transmission to credit markets will suffer, making a large rate cut pointless.",
        "What compounds this is the rising risk aversion in the financial system will get exacerbated by a looming spike in NPAs because of the loan and mortgage holidays announced.",
        "This will hinder transmission even more.",
        "_Fourth, since the last review, a variety of high frequency indicators have_ declined sharply.",
        "There has been a broad based and deep contraction in the March IIP (Index of Industrial Production) which fell to -16.7% from 4.6% in March.",
        "Passenger vehicle sales have plummeted.",
        "Consumer non-durables have fallen by -16%.",
        "Indicators of fixed investment have tanked: finished steel consumption has declined by -90.9%, and IIP Capital goods (which proxy for machinery and equipment) have also fallen by -35.6%.",
        "PMI manufacturing declined to 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March due to a sharp contraction in output and new export orders.",
        "The services PMI dropped to 5.4 in April from 49.3 in March due to a sharp fall in business activity.",
        "Exports have also fallen drastically by -60.3%.",
        "While these have no doubt resulted in a large negative output gap, it is also true that potential output has also fallen.",
        "The only silver lining is the agriculture sector.",
        "The current Rabi crop has done well.",
        "And the current summer sowing of crops (for rice, pulses, coarse cereals, and oilseeds) is higher by 43.7% over last year.",
        "The strongest argument for a big rate cut would therefore be the dire growth outcomes because of COVID.",
        "However, such rate cuts should be saved for when the economy starts reviving, and not when we are in a lock-down.",
        "Rate cuts, assuming that there is transmission and banks lend, works most effectively when the economy is on the upside.",
        "The MPC should keep some gunpowder dry.",
        "_Fifth, the reverse repo rate has been cut thrice in succession to 3.35%.",
        "The_ idea behind the asymmetric cuts is to use the LAF corridor as an instrument of monetary policy.",
        "For all practical purposes the reverse repo rate is now the effective policy rate.",
        "I worry that the current quantum of liquidity will be difficult to unwind when markets, but lender of last resort policies, as is widely recognised, are not useful outside a crisis, and thus should not be viewed as part of normal monetary policy.",
        "Given the above reasons, I vote to cut the policy rate by 25 bps this time.",
        "I will continue to watch the incoming growth-inflation data carefully, and remain data dependent.",
        "I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative.",
        "The nationwide lockdown over the past two months due to the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted domestic economic activity, yielding a grim prognosis for the economy.",
        "This unprecedented and extraordinary economic and health crisis has also gravely affected the global economy with acute intensity and spread.",
        "On the domestic inflation front, headline CPI inflation fell from 6.6 per cent in February 2020 to 5.8 per cent in March.",
        "For the month of April, only partial information has been released, providing the numbers for food inflation, which rose from 7.8 per cent in March to 8.6 per cent in April, with prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oils, milk and cereals being the prime drivers.",
        "However, low crude oil prices, soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials, and weakening aggregate demand are expected to soften inflation, although supply disruptions may impact inflation adversely.",
        "Overall, headline inflation is expected to ease in the second half of FY:2020-21 and fall below target.",
        "This also conforms with the May 2020 round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India that shows higher inflation expectations for the three-months-ahead forecasts compared to forecasts for the one-year-ahead horizon.",
        "On the domestic output front, the evolving pandemic has had serious ramifications for domestic growth, which is crippled by a near-standstill in economic activity due to the lockdown and social distancing, leading to demand compression as dramatically in March 2020.",
        "A similar dismal picture emerges in indicators of rural sharply in the same period.",
        "Indicators of fixed investment also fell, with a sharp drop in finished steel consumption in April and cement production in March, reflecting a slowdown in construction activity.",
        "Moreover, capital goods production (as per the usebased classification of IIP) declined by 36 per cent in March, along with a significant drop in capital goods imports during March and April.",
        "While the data for the March print of IIP has been compiled with limited sample due to the institution of the lockdown from March 25, the preliminary data indicates a drop in IIP by almost 17 per cent, with manufacturing falling by more than 20 per cent, infrastructure/construction goods by almost 24 per cent and electricity by 6.8 per cent.",
        "its lowest level of 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March, partly due to contraction in output and new exports orders.",
        "The PMI for services dropped dramatically to an unprecedented level of 5 4 in April from 49 3 in March due mainly to a drop in business activity, new business orders and new export business.",
        "High frequency indicators of the services sector, in addition to those mentioned above (passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic), and including foreign tourist arrival, railway freight traffic, and commercial vehicle sales, contracted in March/April.",
        "Fortunately, growth in agriculture has held up, with the total area under summer crops including rice, pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds up by 43.7 per cent as on advance estimates of crop production for 2019-20, production of foodgrains (kharif and rabi) in 2019-20 is 3.7 per cent higher than the final estimates of the previous year.",
        "The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in May 2020 also paints a grim picture, showing that the overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low, while the Future Expectations Index reflects high pessimism for the year ahead.",
        "Thus, consumer sentiment has plunged to abysmally low levels.",
        "At the global level, the global manufacturing PMI plunged to an eleven year low in April 2020, while the global services PMI sharply declined to a record low.",
        "with exports falling by 60.3 per cent in April 2020, while imports dropped by 58.6 per cent.",
        "The economic situation is thus extremely gloomy.",
        "While the COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian and health crisis, the related lockdown has precipitated a collapse in economic activity, which has come to a near standstill.",
        "Other than in the agriculture sector, economic activity may continue to remain sluggish even after the lifting of the lockdown, due to social distancing and shortage of labour as a result of the migration of workers to their native places.",
        "In fact, GDP growth in FY:2020-21 is expected to remain in negative territory, with some respite in the second half of the fiscal year.",
        "The way forward in terms of restoration of economic activity thus depends on the speed with which the pandemic is contained, how quickly the Indian economy opens up, and how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives.",
        "It will also depend on the impact of the combined stimulus from fiscal, monetary, social and administrative measures that have been implemented to create conditions conducive to survival in the crisis, as well as for revival in growth.",
        "Over time, some reprioritisation in government expenditure towards health infrastructure and capital expenditure may also be desirable for promoting economic revival.",
        "The Government has outlined a comprehensive package in five tranches covering, amongst other measures, rural employment creation, infrastructure creation, focus on MSME sector and creation of an enabling business environment.",
        "The package also includes relief measures for poorer sections of society and for resource constrained state governments by increasing their borrowing limits.",
        "The measures also encompass a number of major structural reforms, which are more long-term in nature.",
        "The Reserve Bank of India has used conventional monetary policy measures as well as unconventional monetary policy tools that supplement the conventional measures in order to ease financial conditions and stimulate growth in the economy.",
        "It has also undertaken several measures to improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy, and provide relief on debt servicing.",
        "Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Indian economy, the policy repo rate had already been reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 in response to the slowdown in economic activity.",
        "Since the advent of the pandemic, the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting, amounting to a total cut of 210 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020.",
        "The t li t i i t l di t f b k h i d ith 90 b i points decline in the one-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 114 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020 with a fall of 43 basis points in March itself.",
        "Given the severity and depth of the crisis, the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated.",
        "Thus, in order to revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, it is important to ease financial conditions further.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for cutting the policy rate by 40 basis points.",
        "This brings the total reduction in the policy rate since the start of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to 115 basis points with the magnitude of cut in the easing cycle that started in February 2019, (up to May 2020) being 250 basis points.",
        "In the current scenario, with heightened uncertainty and a near-standstill in economic activity, this may not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in borrowing, but should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment, going forward.",
        "I also vote to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",
        "Continuing lockdown in the geographical areas that contribute a major share in the Indian economy and worsening global economic situation due to COVID-19 has now created a distinct possibility of the real GDP growth in India during 2020-21 to be in the negative zone for the first time in the last 40 years.",

        "The government has provided a major fiscal boost through a series of announcements.",
        "The role of the monetary policy under such circumstances should be to supplement and support the fiscal efforts to bring the economy out of the unprecedented crisis.",
        "Without exhausting all the space for policy rate cuts, in this meeting I, therefore, vote for a 40 bps cut in the policy Repo Rate and maintaining the accommodative stance.",
        "More specific i) Under the lockdown, measurement of consumer inflation and a survey of household inflationary expectations are likely to quite problematic.",
        "The samples would be truncated and undesirable biases may enter the estimates making them unreliable and non-representative.",
        "Under such circumstances, I feel, the model based forecasts provide a better guide.",
        "A very carefully carried out forecasting exercise provides an estimate of headline CPI inflation around 2.8 percent for Q4 2020-21.",
        "Even accounting for uncertainties, a very conservative of 4 percent does not seem to be any concern for the policy right now.",
        "ii) Although the real policy rate in most other comparator countries is zero or negative, in India it is not only positive but relatively very high at around 1.2 to 1.6 percent.",
        "I believe that the real policy rate needs to be kept positive but not so high under the present conditions.",
        "iii) The fiscal boost given by the Central government in several instalments is likely to result in further slippage of the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of only 150 bps.",
        "Similarly, all states together may raise their fiscal deficit to GDP ratio by about 150 bps.",
        "Thus, the impact on the combined fiscal deficit to GDP ratio may be confined to about 300 bps, which in my opinion is quite prudent under such extreme conditions.",
        "It may not be inflationary and may result in growth recovery.",
        "iv) Once the situation returns back to normal and the fiscal and monetary boost measures start generating impacts, the recovering economy in my opinion may require some further boost.",
        "It is prudent to preserve some space for the future.",
        "Considering all these factors, I vote for a 40 bps reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance.",
        "The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity has turned out to be much more acute than initially expected with the nation-wide lockdown having been extended from initial 3 weeks to 9 weeks.",
        "There is still uncertainty as to when the epidemiological curve will flatten and this will continue to cloud the macroeconomic outlook for some more time.",
        "Be that as it may, we are staring at a huge negative growth in the current quarter and overall negative growth for the year as a whole.",
        "Both demand and supply sides of the economy have collapsed.",
        "However, I believe that supplies would recover much faster than demand.",
        "This is because capacity to produce goods and services by and large remains intact, though non-availability of labour may temporarily hamper production for a few months.",
        "On the other hand, however, there has been a substantial loss of demand.",
        "A large number of daily labourers/wage earners have been rendered jobless because of lockdown.",
        "Though a part of the unemployed work force will get back to work, still there are some sectors which have been hit hard and many people working in these sectors may have lost their jobs permanently.",
        "This will adversely affect private consumption.",
        "Otherwise also, consumer confidence has been dented and consumers are likely to cut down on discretionary spending.",
        "Within aggregate demand, while private consumption is likely to slowdown from the pre-COVID-19 levels, what worries me more is investment demand, which is likely to be impacted severely for a variety of reasons.",
        "First, given the collapse in demand, excess capacity is likely to be created in many sectors.",
        "This, combined with huge uncertainty about future demand, both domestic and external, is likely to hamper new will also be a challenge.",
        "Third, the focus of government spending, both by the Centre and the States, will also be on revenue expenditure than on capital expenditure.",
        "For all these reasons, investment activity, which contracted in last two quarters, is expected to be severely hit, going forward.",
        "Moving on to inflation, the NSO has released data only on the food and housing groups for April 2020.",
        "Food inflation rose to 8.6 per cent in April from 7.8 per cent in March.",
        "However, these numbers need to be interpreted with a caution as the rise in food prices in April was caused by a disruption in supply lines and is transitory.",
        "The wedge between CPI inflation and WPI inflation for food in April widened sharply by more than 500 bps.",
        "While CPI food inflation increased by close to 80 bps in April, WPI inflation declined by 190 bps from 5.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent, suggesting an increase in margins at a retail level due to supply bottlenecks.",
        "Should monsoon be normal, as it has been forecast, it should also have a salutary effect on food inflation.",
        "I, therefore, feel that risks to food inflation, other than in pulses, are minimal at this stage and overall food inflation is expected to resume its downward trajectory from May/June.",
        "Though the print of CPI fuel inflation was not available for April, data from oil market companies suggest that domestic LPG and kerosene plunged in April in line with a decline in global prices.",
        "Finally, we also do not have core inflation (excluding food and fuel) print for April.",
        "The fall in international crude oil prices has not been passed on to domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel.",
        "Though this makes domestic pump prices vulnerable to any rise in international prices, on the current demand supply balance, oil prices are likely to remain soft.",
        "Given the collapse in domestic demand, core inflation should soften significantly from the current levels over the medium term.",
        "Input cost pressures are also likely to ease due to a sharp decline in global commodity prices.",
        "Housing inflation at less than 4 per cent during March-April was the lowest in the series.",
        "Gold prices are expected to remain firm due to a flight to safety.",
        "On the whole, however, core inflation is expected to remain benign over the next few quarters.",
        "Even though there is expected to be a V shaped recovery, the economy will still be left with a considerable slack, which will keep core inflation under check.",
        "To sum up, economic activity is expected to contract in 2020-21.",
        "While supply lines are likely to be restored as lockdown is relaxed, demand would take far longer to revive to pre-COVID levels.",
        "Even as some support will be provided by government expenditure, overall consumption is likely to slow down due to a slump in private consumption.",
        "More than private consumption, however, it is investment demand which is expected to be hit hard in this uncertain environment and may be a huge drag on economic activity in the near future with attendant implications for potential growth.",
        "Therefore, concerted efforts need to be made to revive investment demand.",
        "Overall, inflation over the medium term is expected to be benign.",
        "Monetary policy has been eased significantly since February 2019 and the Government has also taken several measures, which will help mitigate deleterious impact of COVID-19 on aggregate demand.",
        "However, an unprecedented collapse in demand calls for further easing of financing conditions.",
        "With the likely contraction in economic activity and the inflation outlook remaining soft, the policy space has opened up.",
        "I, therefore, vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points and keeping the stance accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",
        "Given the long transmission lags with which monetary policy operates, it is important to create enabling financing conditions so that economic activity takes off swiftly as soon as normalcy is restored.",
        "Should the inflation trajectory turn out as expected, some more policy space may open up, going forward.",
        "For monetary policy actions to transmit fully to the credit market, it is important that banks remain well capitalised.",
        "Only banks with strong balance sheets could be expected to support lending activity as and when credit demand picks up.",
        "In my view, the destruction of economic activity by COVID-19 and ensuing lockdowns is much more deleterious in terms of loss of basic livelihood, economic security, health and confidence than the range of estimates/projections of GDP and other macroeconomic aggregates suggest.",
        "In India, as in the rest of the world, external consumption is tenuously holding on to positive territory, but spending patterns have altered drastically away from the discretionary and to the essential.",

        "potential output has been pushed down, and it will take years to repair.",
        "In the deliberations of the MPC, my view is that the threats to growth have to be addressed frontally and aggressively or risk a more dire outlook 64.",
        "Meanwhile, the prolonged lockdown has thrown supply into disarray and interrupted the easing of inflation that had gotten underway after the January 2020 peaking.",
        "Contemporaneous information suggests that the momentum in the prices of several food items, especially perishables, may be ebbing, with favourable implications for the evolution of headline inflation going forward.",
        "This suggests that the food price spike has very little persistence and dispersion (except in April 2020 when the lockdown started producing wider effects), and can be looked through for policy purposes.",
        "The sustained loss of momentum of seasonally adjusted GDP growth over eight consecutive quarters is depressing the underlying momentum of core inflation, and this is likely to continue in the near term, as aggregate demand would take time to return to pre-COVID levels.",
        "Relative prices tend to adjust within the budget constraint.",
        "For setting monetary policy, however, it is the absolute level of prices and its prospective movements that matter.",
        "This warrants a careful assessment of aggregate demand.",
        "Apart from the unidirectional loss of speed in real GDP growth, monetary conditions are also reflecting the fragile state of demand.",
        "While reserve money adjusted for the first round CRR effects is expanding substantially in relation to its pace a year ago, this essentially 14.9 per cent a year ago.",
        "In the current milieu in which banks are depositing sizeable balances with the Reserve Bank rather than lending/investing, the money multiplier at which this reserve money expansion translates into money supply, has to be adjusted to include LAF reverse repos, which are essentially (remunerated) excess reserves.",
        "With this adjustment, the money multiplier would have effectively declined from its normal level of 5.5 to about 4.5.",
        "This is showing up in the rate of money supply which has slowed below its secular trend; in fact, the negative money gap (actual rate of money supply minus its trend rate) has widened since 2019-20, especially from the second half.",
        "Both bank credit and investments are decelerating to multi-year lows, pointing to badly dented demand and risk aversion.",
        "On the other hand, bank deposits are growing faster than a year ago, driven by a precautionary savings instinct in these times of heightened uncertainty.",
        "It is important to break this recessionary loop, shore up the erosion in confidence, incentivise banks to invest and lend, and people to spend.",
        "It is this context that should condition monetary policy actions and stance.",
        "The MPC has decided to remain accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the fallout of COVID-19.",
        "In keeping with this stance, the policy rate has been reduced by 75 basis points since February 2020 when the virus outbreak assumed pandemic proportions.",
        "In the evolving configuration of growth and inflation, monetary policy can inspire confidence among households and businesses to break and invest.",
        "Ahead of turning to mend broken areas of activity, it is important to nurture that they take root and grow.",
        "These considerations warrant backing up past actions and stance with another decisive reduction in the policy rate while persevering with the accommodative stance.",
        "The experience of central banks has been that monetary policy acts best when it is reinforced by policy actions and stance in the same direction repetitively till the desired objectives are achieved.",
        "The size of the rate reduction needs to be calibrated to the space opened up by the inflation outlook, after allowing for margins of error in these fluid and uncertain times, while keeping in mind the ramifications of the size of the rate reduction for financial stability.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has been reflected in the resolutions of the MPC in the recent period.",

        "Among the major groups, for which indices were released, food group inflation edged up in April 2020 (to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in the previous month) due to a broad-based increase in inflation across the food sub-groups.",

        "There is still uncertainty as to when the COVID curve will flatten.",
        "Even as the supply side is expected to ease gradually as the lockdown related restrictions are phased out, it is the demand side, which will continue to weigh heavily on economic activity for some time to come.",

        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "The outlook for Q4 (October-December) of 2020 is overcast with a surge in COVID-19 infections in a second wave across Europe, the US and major emerging market economies (EMEs), with accompanying lockdowns.",
        "Progress on vaccine candidates has, however, generated some offsetting optimism.",
        "World trade recorded a rebound in Q3 as lockdowns were eased, but it is likely to slow in Q4 as pent-up demand is exhausted, inventory restocking is completed, and traderelated uncertainty is rising with the second wave.",
        "CPI inflation has remained muted across major advanced economies (AEs) while it picked up in some EMEs on firming food prices and supply disruptions.",
        "Global financial markets remain buoyant, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies and positive news on the vaccine.",

        "In Q3:2020-21, high frequency indicators point to a recovery gaining traction, with double digit growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption in October, although there was moderation in some of these indicators in November.",
        "Riding on the favourable monsoon, the outlook for agriculture remains bright, with rabi sowing up 4.0 per cent from the acreage covered at this time last year under supportive soil moisture and reservoir conditions.",
        "CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, with some evidence that price pressures are spreading.",
        "Food inflation surged to double digits in October across protein-rich items including pulses, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks.",
        "Core inflation, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel, also picked up from 5.4 per cent in September to 5.8 per cent in October.",
        "Both three months and one year ahead inflation expectations of households have eased modestly in anticipation of the seasonal moderation of food prices in the winter and easing of supply chain disruptions.",

        "Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in rural demand is expected to strengthen further, while urban demand is also gaining momentum as unlocking spurs activity and employment, especially of labour displaced by COVID-19.",
        "These positive impulses are, however, clouded by a possible rise in infections in some parts of the country, prompting some local containment measures.",

        "The rewards are low because long rates are what are relevant for stimulating investments and supporting an economic recovery; a steepening of the yield curve by a reduction in short rates does not accomplish this.",
        "Also, a reduction in long rates that stimulates investment not only increases demand in the short run, but it also stimulates supply in the medium term as the new capacity becomes operational, and this new supply dampens inflationary pressures.",
        "By contrast, the demand that is stimulated by a reduction in short rates is not accompanied by an offsetting supply boost, and therefore carries greater inflationary risks.",
        "A sub 3% short rate accumulation and stoking inflationary buildup in sectors that are showing incipient anecdotal signs of cartelization and resurgence of pricing power.",
        "Anecdotal evidence suggests that in several sectors which are characterized by an oligopolistic core and a competitive periphery, the oligopolistic core has weathered the pandemic well and it is the competitive periphery that has been debilitated.",
        "Rising profits and profit margins, improving capacity utilization and lack of new capacity additions create ripe conditions for the oligopolistic core to start exercising pricing power.",
        "These are also the enterprises that are benefiting from borrowing at rates below the policy corridor through commercial paper issuance.",
        "I fear therefore that a sustained failure to defend the policy corridor could prove expensive in terms of creating inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations though, so far, low rates have been feeding into asset markets rather than goods price expectations survey released just before the MPC meeting reported an increase in inflation expectations.",
        "Turning to the resolution, I indicated in my individual statement for the October 2020 inflation have both drifted towards the edge of the fan charts while remaining within them.",
        "Nevertheless, it is my considered view that the balance of risk and reward at the current juncture is still in favour of monetary accommodation.",
        "Therefore, I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level.",
        "I also support the accommodative stance and liquidity support that drive short term rates towards the reverse repo rate rather than the repo rate, while being wary of a drop below the corridor.",

        "It remains to be seen how it might respond ahead as pent-up demand wanes while animal spirits remain anaemic.",
        "Furthermore, fiscal impulse has weakened since Q2:2020-21 and, therefore, despite inflation persistence, pulling back the monetary support to aggregate demand will not be an apt choice at this juncture.",
        "High inflation has persisted longer than predicted at the time of the preceding MPC meeting in early October.",
        "This was mainly due to unseasonal rains that caused vegetables price spike.",
        "As a base case, inflation should still start correcting in near months and fall below the upper-tolerance levels by December 2020.",
        "The upside risks, however, remain with some evidence that price pressures are starting to get distended.",
        "Notwithstanding the remarkable improvement in activity levels, as also captured by normalisation of several high frequency indicators, there are several reasons to believe that growth will stay below trend for the rest of the year, even though positive terrain may be reached before close of the current fiscal year.",
        "The sharp recovery seen in indicators relating to auto sales cannot be interpreted as being reflective of the underlying trend in aggregate demand or supply conditions as pent-up purchases were being delayed, first on account of transition to stricter emission standards that kicked in since April and then on account of pandemic related lockdowns.",
        "Services sector accounted for 63 per cent of the gross value added and contributed 78 per cent to the overall growth over preceding two years.",
        "Several services continue to be deeply affected by the pandemic.",
        "These include hospitality, construction, real estate, trade, and several types of transport, even though railway freight movement has normalised.",
        "Investment demand which had significantly contributed to overall growth in 2017-18 and 2018-19 had dropped off in 2019-20 and was the main driver of the growth contraction during Q1:2020-21 and despite remarkable sequential improvement in Q2 is likely to stay weak, with capacity utilisation rate likely staying below 70 per cent against long-term average of 74.0 per cent.",
        "Non-food credit, a leading indicator for growth is not clear at this stage and, in any case, it has not yet acquired strength to alter the growth-inflation trade.",
        "Furthermore, in Q2:2020-21, government final consumption expenditure contracted by 22.2 per cent and public administration, defence and other services by 12.2 per cent, dragging the growth down in terms of weighted contribution to growth by 2.9 percentage points from the demand-side and 1.7 percentage points from the supply-side, respectively; lower supply-side nevertheless come from automatic stabilisers that have been stronger than in many emerging markets but remain weaker than in advanced economies, especially as they act through fall in tax revenue but have no automaticity to increase spending.",
        "The discretionary fiscal policies, therefore, become important but policy space has been limited by largely procyclical fiscal policies followed for years.",
        "In this backdrop, fiscal policy has attempted restrained counter-cyclical support since 2019-20.",
        "Going forward, growth is likely to get some support from fiscal spending in the remaining months of this fiscal year when bulk of the on-budget stimulus is likely to be spent.",
        "Given that fiscal multipliers are higher during large downturns and also that investment multipliers distinctly exceed revenue spending multipliers, the growth-targeting investment measures announced as part of additional stimulus in October and November are likely to complement monetary policy support to growth in a measured way.",
        "Though monetary policy so far has provided a bungee cord to the growth, its tensile strength depends on how inflation evolves ahead.",
        "The nature of inflation still remains predominantly supply driven but with addition of some elements of cost-push inflation that can get a further fillip if three is a feedback from recent increased rural wage inflation.",
        "Cost-push inflation, even when arising from factors such as increasing food and energy prices, especially crude oil, and higher direct taxes, can start below the natural rate of unemployment if monetary accommodation is large and sustained.",
        "The Great Inflation episode after the oil price shock of 1973 bears testimony of these risks to which one needs to be mindful, even though recent flattening of Phillips curve has diminished correlation between core inflation and output.",
        "A decade back, postglobal financial crisis, pushing demand continually, did result in resurgence of inflation in India.",
        "These risks are not imminent at this point.",
        "Since February 2020 policy, RBI has announced liquidity measures adding to about Rs 12.7 trillion.",
        "A significant portion of this liquidity has been parked back at central bank window.",
        "Therefore, it has not had a perverse effect on inflation so far.",
        "Through the interest rate, credit and confidence channels it prevented credit from dropping as steeply as nominal GDP.",
        "It also helped in maintaining total flow of resources to commercial sector this large liquidity infusion served a very important role in preventing meltdown of markets in Q1 of 2020, reversing the spike in financial spreads observed in March, averting acute credit crunch, thwarting tightening of financial conditions that could have plummeted economy into a deep recession with its domino effects on financial stability that could have further complicated policy choices.",
        "The money supply growth so far this year has been reasonable.",
        "It has accommodated the shock to growth and substantially compensated for the steep drop in velocity of money that saw demand for currency to spike in Q1.",
        "However, going forward, at a point when expansion of activity takes firmer roots, recalibration of policies will become essential.",
        "In my assessment, given that output gap will close only in H2 of 2021-22, there is time to normalise monetary policy.",
        "As the pandemic shock created a huge negative output gap, even with high weight to core inflation along with lower weights to headline inflation and output gap, the projected path of these variables leaves time before policy rate hikes will become necessary.",
        "This is simply because the pandemic shock has left a huge negative output gap.",
        "If output gap closes faster than anticipated, core CPI inflation surges on back of observed momentum in some WPI inflation components or more supply-side shocks lead to generalisation of inflation, policy will need to respond appositely.",
        "I am labouring to explain this point because accommodative monetary policy has been misread by some as demise of inflation targeting.",
        "Quite to the contrary, current policies are consistent with the flexible inflation targeting mandate and hard empirical calculations of how monetary policy needs to react to projected path for key variables.",
        "The framework itself has delivered unambiguous gains in disinflating the economy and lowering inflation expectations.",
        "Monetary policy under the inflation targeting strategy requires policy to be informed by economic analysis.",
        "Liquidity, credit and monetary aggregates will need to be closely monitored in this context with an eye on macro-financial stability that can be enervated when short-term borrowing costs fall below the operational policy rate.",
        "If this results in persistence of negative real rates for too long, it can adversely affect savings, lend support to mispricing of financial asset prices and encourage excessive leveraging.",
        "As such, other policies outside the flexible inflation targeting framework, such as macroprudential and strengthening the instruments of sterilisation in view of surge in capital inflows in recent months may be needed to mitigate these risks.",
        "Considering the growth and inflation projections and other considerations enumerated above, I vote to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent.",
        "I also vote for retaining the accommodative stance and accompanying forward guidance.",
        "I vote for status quo on the policy rate at this juncture and to maintain the accommodative mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "The preponderant weight assigned by the monetary policy committee (MPC) to growth shallower than anticipated contraction in the economy in Q2:2020-21; strengthening incoming data in Q3 so far.",
        "A Beveridge-Nelson type trend cycle decomposition of real GDP (seasonally adjusted) indicates that the economy is perched on the shoulder of the recovery phase of the underlying cycle.",
        "Investment, followed by exports and private consumption, are the drivers of the recovering demand momentum, offsetting the drag from the decline in government spending.",
        "In terms of trends, government spending and exports remain stable, but private consumption and investment are on a downward trajectory. '",

        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent.",

        "Global financial markets remain supported by highly accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions.",
        "Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs, supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures.",
        "On the domestic front, high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is stabilising in Q2:2020-21 after the 23.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in real GDP in Q1 (April-June).",

        "The outlook for agriculture is robust.",

        "On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties.",

        "Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand.",
        "COVID-19-related supply disruptions, including labour shortages and high transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on inter-state movements.",
        "Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).",
        "Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections.",

        "Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic.",
        "Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in Q4.",

        "The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises.",
        "Accordingly, they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy.",
        "Taking into account all these factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further.",

Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year, with Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voting against this formulation.",

        "The policy rates were left unchanged in the meeting of the MPC held on January and May 2020 in view of the prevailing modest GDP growth rate.",
        "The MPC policy statement of August 2020 reflected the concerns on the economic outlook as the COVID-19 pandemic began to take its toll.",
        "The contraction in GDP in Q1: 2020-21, year-on-year basis, by 23.9 per cent, is a severe shock to the economy affecting employment and income.",
        "The decline in economic output is reflected in both production and expenditure accounts across most components.",
        "The Gross Value Added declined in all the non-farm sectors and in the case of demand, contraction in Private Final Consumption Expenditure and Gross Fixed Capital Formation was sharp.",
        "The only major component of demand that showed growth was Government Final Consumption Expenditure.",
        "Both exports and imports of goods and services declined, with imports declining more than the decline in exports.",
        "In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the extensive restrictions on the movement of goods and services barring the essential needs, imposed from the last week of March-May saw gradual relaxation from June onwards but a full economic recovery will require adjustments in the production and supply processes to control the spread of the disease.",
        "The recovery process will also be affected by the dynamic of the pandemic across the country as regional variations would also affect supply chains.",
        "The present status of the impact of the pandemic suggests that there has been reduction in the daily new cases and mortalities due to COVID-19 towards the end of September but these numbers are large and the potential for an increase cannot be ignored.",
        "This would mean that relaxation of movement restrictions would help restore production, but the process would be gradual and subject to the measures that would be taken by the producers, providers of services and the consumers to control the spread of the virus.",
        "Restoration of the supply side of the economy in a manner that is safe for the workers and the consumers is necessary for sustained economic recovery.",
        "There will be a need for changes in transportation and work places to mitigate the risks associated with the transmission of Covid 19.",
        "The relative immunity of agriculture from the supply shocks may have been partly a result of the fact that the virus spread initially in urban areas and there were immediate efforts to limit the spread.",
        "The supply chains for the key food commodities were also exempted from transport restrictions, leading to sustenance of supply of these commodities.",
        "There are indeed constraints that need to be addressed to restore the health of the firms that have lost revenues and returns.",
        "Access to credit to revive and expand production and markets is one of the essential factors in this regard.",
        "Bank lending rates to the productive sectors including housing have declined and a robust revival, however, would depend on the revival of demand.",
        "The weak demand conditions are also reflected in the decline in non-food bank credit upto September in 2020-21 over the previous year.",
        "Revival of consumer demand would require restoration of confidence in the safety in participation in normal economic activities and availability of health care.",
        "Public investment in improving infrastructure to achieve these goals would help build consumer confidence.",
        "The current account balance, foreign capital flows and forex reserves position indicate relative stability in the external sector under a low demand equilibrium in both domestic and global markets.",
        "The depressed investment demand conditions are also reflected in the dampened state of demand for capital and weak growth in bank credit to non-food sector.",
        "The fiscal position of the governments - both Centre and the States - is under pressure as the tax revenues have declined.",
        "The governments will be required to maintain their spending levels to meet the extraordinary demands to support livelihoods and lives in the present conditions.",
        "Continued weakness in demand conditions would put greater stress on fiscal position and also the financial system.",
        "The broad indicators of economic activity in the recent months suggest a revival from the sharp decline in Q1.",
        "Some of this improvement is on account of relaxation of movement restrictions, opportunities in sectors such as the pharma industry, and the requirement of critical inputs such as fertilisers.",
        "The more general pickup in activities is reflected in the expectation of improvement in capacity utilisation and perceptions of improved demand conditions in the recent surveys of enterprises reported by RBI.",
        "The GDP will see sustained revival beginning from the second quarter of the year, with the rate of contraction from the levels of previous year declining steadily.",
        "As indicated in the MPC Resolution, the GDP growth is expected to be positive in Q4: 2020-21, although for the year as a whole, the growth rate is projected to be 9 5 t th i Th S f P f i l F t conducted by RBI in September 2020 yields a median forecast of -9.1 per cent for the places the GDP growth for 2020-21 at -12.6 per cent.",
        "Going forward into Q2 to Q4: 2020-21 these projections imply recovery in the economic activities from the large initial negative shock in Q1.",
        "On the price front, the CPI inflation has stayed above 6.5%, Y-o-Y basis during July-August 2020.",
        "This is above the tolerance band of the inflation target set for the monetary policy.",
        "The food inflation averaged 8.4% during the same period and CPI based inflation rate for items excluding food and fuel was 5.6%.",
        "The food inflation will remain a concern as it is often driven by the perishable produce like vegetables, which cannot be controlled in the short term except by removing bottlenecks in the supply chain upto the retail level or additional fresh supplies.",
        "As noted in MPC Resolution, inflation is expected to moderate in Q3 and Q4: 2020-21.",
        "Two of the main drivers of price inflation on the supply side now are food and fuel.",
        "In the case of food, the favourable monsoon rains support the prospects of good harvest and its moderating impact on food inflation.",
        "The global conditions for crude petroleum prices appear stable from here onwards till the end of 2020-21.",
        "There are clearly uncertainties facing the growth and inflation projections.",
        "There is also uncertainty over the speed with which the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control, which also affects growth and inflation scenarios in the next after the relaxation of restrictions on transportation and businesses across the country.",
        "As supply chains adapt to the new conditions, recovery is expected to be stronger and sustained.",
        "To achieve this outcome, an accommodative monetary policy is needed at this juncture.",
        "Moderation in upward cost pressures on prices and decline in food inflation rates would require a quick output recovery from the supply side measures.",
        "need for a policy environment enabling recovery of output.",
        "The inflationary pressures are a concern but present assessment reflects moderating inflationary pressures in the remaining quarters of the year.",
        "Therefore, I vote for retaining the current policy rates and continuation of accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "I also vote to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year.",
        "Growth has fallen steeply while inflation is also above target.",
        "The question of what can revive growth as well as reduce inflation is best examined in the 32.",
        "COVID-19 led to crash in demand as well as disrupted domestic supply chains.",
        "As, under gradual unlocks, the latter revive while infections reduce, the supply-side is recovering.",
        "The heavy rains raised food prices but also promise a bountiful crop.",
        "Over the longer term, structural food surpluses, agricultural reforms and global changes in oil demand and supply can be expected to keep commodity prices soft.",
        "Reform is also reducing obstacles that raise production costs in India.",
        "Therefore, inflation can be expected to moderate.",
        "Research shows commodity price shocks and credible RBI guidance to be major determinants of inflation expectations.",
        "higher productivity jobs suggest it has an elastic supply curve but it is one that is subject to upward shocks[1].",
        "Apart from supply-side features that raise costs, shocks include inflation expectations and changes in exchange rates.",
        "Moderating these shocks is the most effective way to reduce inflation in India.",
        "Monetary-financial conditions have a relatively greater impact on aggregate demand and output growth while the composition of government expenditure and taxation affects costs.",
        "An elastic supply curve implies a demand squeeze has little impact on inflation but creates a large output loss.",
        "Moreover, excessive tightness hurts financial stability as much as excessive stimulus does.",
        "Necessary reforms over the last decade have improved the credit culture, governance, diversity and robustness in the financial system and conditions are ripe for a turnaround.",
        "COVID-19 creates an opportunity for a reversal of tight financial conditions[2].",
        "COVID-19 also creates uncertainty and precautionary hoarding of liquidity and savings.",
        "Therefore demand is now a greater constraint than supply.",
        "That inflation exceeds the MPC target when demand has crashed much below potential output suggests lockdown related shocks have pushed up the supply curve.",
        "This should reverse as lockdowns ease.",
        "That CPI inflation is much higher than WPI for the same items points to issues in retail supply.",
        "The CPI itself needs to be rebased to more accurately reflect the lower share of food in the consumption basket.",
        "Since the output gap is already so large, reducing demand and increasing the gap further cannot be the way to reduce inflation.",
        "Firms do tend to raise mark-ups to cover fixed costs when capacity utilization falls but reducing utilization further will only raise costs more.",
        "demand is high, during crisis times it is difficult to induce more spending just through higher liquidity and lower interest rates.",
        "Fiscal deficits have risen countercyclically as tax revenues fell with the lockdowns.",
        "Even so, there is scope for further prudent expansion of government spending to boost demand and trigger private spending to raise growth.",
        "The expenditure should ideally be designed to relieve supply-side constraints.",
        "The ex-post fiscal deficit ratio falls as growth raises the denominator and rising tax revenues reduce the numerator.",
        "37. Financing short-term rise in deficits requires keeping the cost of government borrowing low.",
        "Central banks worldwide are taking such actions.",
        "The monetary policy resolution committing to benign financial conditions for as long as it takes for revival will help both public and private borrowing and spending.",
        "Active and innovative steps, including counter-cyclical macro-prudential regulation, can improve incentives for appropriate action, allay fears, reduce risk aversion, make liquidity more widely available, improve transmission and bring down interest rate spreads.",
        "Mitigating the impact of the unprecedented global health crisis has priority.",
        "It is important, however, there is neither over-reaction nor untimely reversal.",
        "Excess stimulus after the global financial crisis resulted in excess tightening in the decade that followed.",
        "Policy should aim for balance and use available space when it would be most effective.",
        "Forward-looking actions are aiming to be state-contingent, carefully calibrated to the evolving situation and to incoming data.",
        "Early measures required during the lockdown have been successfully reversed.",
        "For example, moratoria given have ended without major adverse impacts on borrowers or the financial system.",
        "Banks now do risk-based lending and the credit guarantee from the government allows private banks also to lend to MSMEs.",
        "Targeted restructuring and freer movement of liquidity through the economy will help firms survive, so that persistent damage is avoided and the economy recovers faster.",
        "Inflation is at present above the target band although it is expected to come down.",
        "Therefore no change in the policy rate itself is appropriate while awaiting the impacts of on-going supply-side improvement, as well as for uncertainty around COVID-19 to dissipate.",
        "I therefore vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "The accommodative stance and the benign financial conditions it makes possible, together with the assurance it will not be reversed until the economy recovers, will support growth.",
        "The repo rate pause together with inflation guidance given will contribute to anchoring inflation expectations.",
        "I have agonized a great deal about dissenting (in part) with a resolution on a narrow technicality when I am in agreement with the spirit of the resolution: am I making a mountain out of a molehill and creating unnecessary confusion?",
        "After prolonged deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that a dissent may be painful, but it is more consistent with the obligation of MPC members to express their views independently and candidly.",
        "Even when a disagreement is more philosophical than operative, it should not always be relegated to the individual statement; I see some merit in occasionally elevating it to a dissent.",
        "My preferred formulation of the forward guidance would have been as follows: necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "The MPC expects to maintain a low policy rate and an accommodative stance during the 42.",
        "It differs from the actual MPC resolution in two respects.",
        "First, in my formulation, the date based forward guidance is not a decision but an expectation.",
        "In a world that is full of unpleasant surprises, the MPC must of necessity be data driven.",
        "Covid-19 was an example of a totally unanticipated growth shock that came out of nowhere.",
        "If a similarly unforeseeable inflation shock were to hit the economy, I find it hard to believe that the MPC will remain accommodative.",
        "In practice, I suspect that realized outcomes do not diverge drastically from what is currently expected.",
        "I am firmly of the view that the MPC risks a damage to its credibility when it uses words that do not accurately reflect what it means.",
        "I therefore disagree with the choice of l ti 43.",
        "Second, my formulation is for a somewhat longer period and explicitly refers to interest rates.",
        "In my view, the principal motivation for the forward guidance is the fact that India has one of the steepest yield curves in the world.",
        "The Indian yield curve is years).",
        "However, in the money market segment (up to a maturity of nearly one year), the yield curve is close to the reverse repo rate of 3.35% (which is the effective policy rate today because of the liquidity support).",
        "To have the desired impact, it is desirable that the forward guidance extend beyond the one year horizon at which the steepness of the yield curve sets in.",
        "Forward guidance of six months in the MPC resolution is in my view suboptimal.",
        "I would also point out that the weakness of investments in the Indian economy predates the Covid-19 pandemic, and this merits a longer term response that goes beyond six months.",
        "One of the hallmarks of a credible inflation targeting regime is a substantial compression of the inflation risk premium.",
        "If the market expects inflation to average close to the target rate of inflation, then, by definition, inflation risk is low and consequently the inflation risk premium should also be very small.",
        "What remains is essentially the liquidity risk premium which cannot explain the extraordinary steepness of the Indian yield curve.",
        "It appears to me that the steep yield curve reflects a lack of credibility of the MPC resolution is an attempt to solve this problem, and my only difficulty with this commitment of the MPC to respond aggressively to inflation shocks that lie well above the upper band of the fan chart (Chart 1 of the Monetary Policy Statement).",
        "I believe that excessively high long term rates are inflicting damage to the economy in two ways.",
        "First, a significant part of the easing of policy rates is not being transmitted to longer term rates that form the benchmark for corporate borrowing and investment decisions.",
        "Excessive long term rates exacerbate the collapse of investments in the economy.",
        "Second, high long term rates cause an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate by stimulating foreign capital inflows into our bond markets at a time when the collapse of investment has caused the current account to swing into surplus.",
        "A sharp reduction in long term rates is therefore important.",
        "On the other hand, with short term rates already at 3.35%, the incremental benefits of a furthering lowering of this rate in the current macroeconomic environment are relatively low and not commensurate with the risks.",
        "So I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level.",
        "I also support the accommodative stance and liquidity support that drive short term rates towards the reverse repo rate rather than the repo rate.",
        "At the time of the August MPC, while noting that monetary policy was being framed under large data and forecast uncertainties, I had also indicated that growth could fall more and, inflation less, than the consensus estimates that prevailed at that point.",
        "Market consensus has since moved significantly.",
        "Survey of Professional F t di t 2020 21 th t ( )9 1 t d f ( )5 8 cent in August and headline inflation to fall to 4.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, up from 3.0 per cent.",
        "The baseline projections in the MPC resolution place growth at (-)9.5 per Q1:2021-22.",
        "The latest projections reaffirm that inflation will fall in line with the target, while growth has plummeted, thus decidedly shifting the growth-inflation policy tradeoff in favour of supporting growth within the flexible inflation targeting paradigm.",
        "During Q1:2020-21, the economy faced its deepest contraction ever, which was also the worst amongst G20 countries.",
        "Despite marked sequential improvements in high frequency indicators of real activity, many of them are yet to normalise to their pre-pandemic levels that were already sub-par as the economy had slowed to a 11-year low in 2019-20.",
        "The GDP is likely to contract close to double-digit mark in Q2:2020-21.",
        "A range of model-based exercises, as well as my judgment superimposed on these, suggest that output gap in terms of levels of GDP will close only towards the end of 2021-22, even though a technical rebound is likely to push the economy to above average growth in that year on a low base.",
        "Investment, that typically comprise about a third of real aggregate demand, contracted 47 per cent in Q1:2020-21.",
        "With seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation for surveyed manufacturing firms dropping to 48 per cent in Q1:2020-21, the large slack already visible in 201920 has deepened further.",
        "As such, investment may take time to recover.",
        "Moving ahead, there is tough row to hoe requiring acorns to be fed in the form of complementary actions to support recovery to trend growth in the coming years.",
        "Though inflation is currently above the upper tolerance band, it is not monetary in nature.",
        "Supply disruption in food, increase in taxes on fuel and liquor, and surge in points lower than the headline inflation.",
        "In my view, headline inflation should start softening from October.",
        "Apart from favourable base effects, the unlocking has picked speed and would significantly reduce supply chain bottlenecks causing both agriculture and non-agricultural prices to correct.",
        "Monsoon risks to inflation have dissipated.",
        "Cumulative rainfall has been 9 per cent above long period average with its temporal and spatial distribution satisfactory.",
        "Area sown under _Kharif has_ expanded by 4.8 per cent.",
        "Reservoir levels are 15 per cent above last 10-year average, lifting up _Rabi prospects.",
        "The First Advance Estimates of_ _Kharif point to_ substantial increase in output of crops like pulses, oilseeds and sugarcane that can have a salutary effect on food and processed food prices and leave enough margin of error for possible subsequent downward revisions in data.",
        "With marked increase in area sown under foodgrains, alongside the buffer of food stock at double the norms, prices should soften.",
        "Vegetable prices that have exhibited persistence at elevated levels due to weather-related disturbances should also correct starting December.",
        "With resumption of businesses by small poultry, high prices in protein items should witness some correction.",
        "As yet, there are no signs of generalisation of relative price shock from food items and agriculture and rural wage inflation has stayed muted.",
        "The current high retail margins have prevailed as consumers avoid scouting for cheaper prices amidst social distancing.",
        "The phenomenon of such less competitive markets have been observed in past pandemics as well, such as the one that contributed to the Eisenhower recession in the United States.",
        "However, the unlock intensity now matches the lockdown stringency and with new confirmed Covid-19 cases starting to decline in recent weeks, unless there is strong second wave, supply chains should get near normalised as early as end of the current calendar year, setting off price corrections.",
        "However, demand will take time to li d k i t i t th t I th i t corporate pricing power is unlikely to recover, though upside risks to inflation remain from possible collusive behaviour in less competitive industries, as also further unforeseen supply disruptions in food.",
        "As a baseline, headline should converge to core inflation, with both softening.",
        "Three macro-financial risks currently concern me that have implications for monetary policy.",
        "First, if growth contractions stay for long, the hysteresis or scarring that has been substantially arrested by nimble-footed policy actions could stage a comeback creating renewed feedback loops within public, corporate and bank balance sheets that would impact the stock of debt as well as fiscal and savinginvestment balances.",
        "If this happens, recovering potential output, some of which may be lost to hysteresis, will take longer.",
        "It will also push the neutral interest rate lower than before.",
        "Despite front-loaded action, monetary policy should, therefore, stay accommodative.",
        "The fiscal restraint observed so far provides some room for it.",
        "However, with term spreads already widening above historical levels in 2019-20 and in H1:2020-21 on back of widening fiscal gap that has necessitated larger government borrowing programmes, the unpleasant arithmetic is evident in supplies of papers more than doubling in two years.",
        "Consequently, the yield curve slope is hardly a predictor of growth or expected inflation.",
        "This is not unique to India and term spreads have been higher and have widened much more during current pandemic in many other emerging markets due to pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policies that leave little counter-cyclical space.",
        "As typically fiscal authorities have a first mover advantage in the game of chickens, monetary policy will naturally have to factor this in its stance to avert Nash equilibria as a pure strategy.",
        "In this milieu, monetary and liquidity easing in India has effectively kept government market borrowing costs at a 16-year low with attendant benefits for funding costs that are obvious but hard to quantify precisely in absence of counterfactual.",
        "Second, if current real negative interest rates fall further, it may generate significant distortions that could adversely affect aggregate savings, current account and medium-term growth in the economy.",
        "With retail fixed deposit rates currently inflation prevailing above that for some months now, there has been a negative carry for savers.",
        "While expected future inflation is lower and leaves some policy room, it is prudent to hold policy rates for now.",
        "Third concern relates to interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, which could intensify further, especially later into next year.",
        "Though low for long interest rates risk build-up of corporate and household leverage, unprecedented contraction entails policy-trade-offs imparting primacy to rebuilding consumer and of their decisions.",
        "In this milieu, forward guidance can play an important role.",
        "Considering all the above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged.",
        "Further considering that output gap may close only towards the end of 2021-22 and that, going forward, the demand destruction caused by the pandemic, coupled with improvements in logistic networks of production and distribution, may exert significant downward pressure on headline and core inflation, I vote for the accommodative stance and the forward guidance provided in the resolution.",
        "The projections of real GDP growth for 2020-21 that are set out for the first expected at the end of November corroborate at least the direction of these forecasts, India has entered a technical recession in the first half of the year for the first time in its history.",
        "GDP is an aggregative indicator of economic activity and hides the extent of human misery and the loss of social and human capital caused by the health crisis.",
        "Nonetheless, if the projections hold, the level of GDP would have fallen approximately 6 per cent below its pre-COVID level by the end of 2020-21 and it may take years to regain this lost output.",
        "There is also an anecdotal sense that the very different from what has been recorded so far.",
        "Changes in social behaviour and norms of commercial and workplace engagements may accentuate this structural change.",
        "Progressive unlocking of the economy has brought people out of isolation and some high frequency indicators into the green.",
        "While this has raised optimism about the much-awaited recovery, perhaps, pragmatic caution is warranted.",
        "The COVID curve is arching inwards, from the cities where infections had hitherto festered, into interior regions.",
        "The fear of a second wave looms over India; already it has forced lockdowns across Europe, Israel and Indonesia, and India, with the second highest caseload of infections and over-stretched healthcare infrastructure, cannot be immune.",
        "In the absence of intrinsic drivers, the recovery may last only until pent-up demand has been satiated and replenishment of inventories has been completed.",
        "world trade volume by 9.2 per cent in 2020, the role of exports in powering a durable revival is likely to be circumscribed.",
        "This underscores the critical role of investment in engineering the turnaround in the economy and sustaining it over the medium-term.",
        "Depressed capacity utilisation in manufacturing, inventory overhang in residential housing, impaired balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions, and pervasive business pessimism are combining to create formidable drags on investment sentiment.",
        "Consequently, an investment-less recovery is doomed to be ephemeral.",
        "Policy intervention accordingly assumes a vital role.",
        "Illustratively, public investment can play both a gap-fill and crowding-in role.",
        "Monetary policy can engender favourable financing conditions by lowering the cost of capital and by narrowing risk spreads on financial instruments.",
        "In the current milieu, however, both monetary policy and fiscal policy in India face tightening constraints, some idiosyncratic.",
        "For fiscal policy, it is the collapse of deficit during April-August is 121.9 per cent of budget estimates.",
        "For monetary policy, it is the persistence of headline inflation above 6 per cent for the third month in succession.",
        "Structural reforms to unlock growth impulses are needed, but may lack social traction in an atmosphere of depressed growth and employment, and high uncertainty.",
        "In the context of headline inflation ruling above the upper tolerance limit of the target since June 2020, the role of monetary policy has come under scrutiny.",
        "It has been argued that while inflationary pressures may emerge from supply bottlenecks and cost pushes, inflation cannot become generalised and persistent unless it becomes a monetary phenomenon, _i.e., it is accommodated by an increase in_ aggregate demand as reflected in an expansion of money supply or by a decrease in policy interest rates.",
        "Monetary policy has adopted an ultra-accommodative stance to revive growth and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.",
        "Liquidity operations in support of thi t h i f d i bl li idit i t th t fl t d i expansion of 17.6 per cent adjusted for the first-round effects of cash reserve ratio changes.",
        "This has, however, not translated into a commensurate increase in money supply because of a money multiplier depressed by a sharp increase in the currencydeposit ratio, and remunerated reserves parked in reverse repo with the RBI over and above CRR requirements.",
        "Consequently, the rate of money supply is averaging 12 per cent in nominal terms and only 6 per cent in real terms.",
        "In terms of quarterly seasonally adjusted annualised rates, a negative money gap has opened up recently.",
        "In a quarterly vector auto regression (VAR) framework, money supply and policy rate reductions together contribute only 4 per cent of the deviation of inflation from its target.",
        "The contribution of supply shocks from food and fuel prices account for 71 per cent of inflation deviations in the first half of 2020-21, followed by 28 per cent from unanchored inflation expectations (deviations of trend inflation from target).",
        "Changes in exchange rates and asset prices together contribute a little less than 12 per cent.",
        "Inflation is pulled down by 15 per cent by the negative demand shock from COVID-19.",
        "Under these conditions, it is essential for monetary policy to remain accommodative and opportunistically exploit the headroom that opens up when inflation recedes, as it is projected in the second half of 2020-21.",
        "Three aspects need to be emphasised.",
        "First, it is important to separate false starts from durable growth drivers.",
        "In this context, all efforts need to be trained on the revival of investment.",
        "Second, in the evolving situation in which monetary policy is committed to an accommodative stance, it is necessary to monitor inflation dynamics closely for signs of generalization and persistence.",
        "For this purpose, all indicators of aggregate demand, including monetary and credit aggregates, warrant continuous examination for inflation impulses.",
        "Third, with unprecedented contractions in economic activity and guidance has to be clear and decisive.",
        "The stance of policy conveys forward guidance on the future trajectory of short-term interest rates, which is well within the the evolving situation, specific in order to anchor expectations.",
        "I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and for retaining the accommodative 63.",
        "After the sharpest contraction in economic activity in Q1:2020-21, a number of high frequency indicators of economic activity for Q2:2020-21 indicate a sequential improvement.",
        "The recovery in all likelihood would be led by rural demand.",
        "In urban areas too, there are indications of an uptick in consumption demand with passenger vehicles emerging out of contraction in August, rebound in GST e-way bills to prepandemic levels, sequential improvement in GST revenues in September and a steady improvement in PMI manufacturing and services.",
        "Accordingly, the recovery is expected to be multi-speed depending on sectoral realities.",
        "Forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank are also indicating a sequential firming up of the recovery.",
        "Households expect an improvement in general economic situation, employment and income over a one year ahead horizon.",
        "Capacity utilisation saw some improvement in Q2:2020-21 and a further pick-up is expected from Q3 onwards.",
        "Manufacturers expect expansion in production volumes and new orders to continue through Q1:2021-22. Business E t ti I d (BEI) l t t i i Q3 2020 21 65.",
        "There are, however, downside uncertainties that could put sand in the wheels of this nascent recovery.",
        "Primary among them is the risk of a second wave of COVID-19.",
        "Private investment activity is likely to be subdued, even as domestic financial conditions have eased significantly.",
        "External demand is expected to remain anaemic with sharp contraction in global economic activity and trade.",
        "Overall, we expect a likely reduction in the rate of contraction in GDP during Q2:2020-21 and a return to positive growth by Q4:2020-21.",
        "Despite sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4, the full year GDP is expected to contract by 9.5 per cent with a strong rebound next year.",
        "Inflation remained above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent since June, with signs of aggravation of price pressures.",
        "The surge in inflation in India in recent period is in stark contrast with the experience of other major emerging market economies (EMEs) where inflation moderated relative to pre-lockdown period.",
        "Adverse supply side factors along with increase in retail margins continue to impinge on food and non-food components of CPI.",
        "Food (with a weight of around 46 per cent in overall CPI) contributed disproportionately at around 60 per cent to the surge in inflation.",
        "In addition, costs of doing business have gone up due to additional sanitisation related expenditures, social distancing norms and labour shortfalls.",
        "On the outlook for inflation, food inflation should moderate going forward on a combination of good kharif harvest and a favourable rabi season.",
        "Households polled by the Reserve Bank expect 3-month ahead inflation expectations to somewhat soften.",
        "As economic activity further normalises and supplies are restored, cost push price pressures faced by firms are likely to dissipate.",
        "However, should supply side shocks, especially to food persist, they can destabilise inflation expectations.",
        "Overall, in our assessment, headline inflation would moderate in H2 of the current year and further in Q1 of next fiscal year.",
        "cent of nominal GDP of 2019-20, has helped to keep systemic liquidity in abundance and easy financial conditions reflected in the narrowing of term and risk premia in various market segments.",
        "During March-August 2020, monetary transmission improved significantly reflecting the combined impact of surplus liquidity and enhanced coverage of the external benchmark-based pricing of loans.",
        "However, despite continued guidance of accommodative stance as long as necessary and ample surplus liquidity, the financial markets remained somewhat nervous and at variance with our expectations.",
        "The market participants were also concerned about the stance going forward.",
        "Monetary policy works through financial markets which serve as the conduit of transmitting policy signals to the real economy.",
        "For seamless propagation of policy understood by market participants so that there are no expectational mismatches between the two.",
        "Accordingly, MPC should strengthen its forward guidance by indicating that the accommodative stance would continue as long as necessary - at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year - to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",
        "This enhanced guidance should strengthen and quicken the pace of transmission to longer-term yields and help support consumption and investment demand in the economy.",
        "Higher i t t i j ti ith t t t l f b th t would help improve supplies and alleviate supply bottlenecks and also contribute to softening of inflation.",
        "Monetary policy at this stage has to provide adequate support to ensure a robust revival of the economy from the devastating effects of COVID-19, while at the same time ensuring that any persistence of elevated inflation does not lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "With the supply side disruptions that are seen to drive the current inflationary pressures likely to be transient and wane out in months ahead as economy normalises, there is merit in looking through the current high levels of inflation and persevere with the accommodative stance for monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis.",
        "Moreover, taking into account the projected moderation in inflation and the large output loss, I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged at present and continue with the accommodative stance, during the current financial year and into the next financial year, at the least.",
        "This would help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility.",
        "This would also enhance confidence in the monetary policy resolve to support the growth recovery process while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",
        "I recognise that there exists space for future rate cuts if the inflation evolves in line with our expectations.",
        "This space needs to be used judiciously to support recovery in growth.",
        "Meanwhile the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions would help ease financial conditions further."

        "More than the cyclical drivers of food inflation, which for most items tends to be mean reverting, what worries me are the upside structural risks to inflation that impinge on the durability of the 4% inflation target in the medium term.",
        "In the past few reviews, I have flagged four such risks: (i) increases in minimum support prices (MSP), (ii) staggered implementation of the pay commission award by the States, (iii) slippages in the fiscal deficit in an election year, (iv) a sustaining of the price of oil at a high level.",
        "Of these, my main concern at the current juncture is the possible simultaneous occurrence of adverse twin terms of trade shocks: internal (via a substantial upward revision of minimum support prices which would raise the relative prices of agricultural goods) and external (the price of oil sustains at a high level).",
        "Such twin terms of trade shocks would complicate inflation management and worsen the growth-inflation trade-off.",
        "While details on what form the MSP policy will take are still awaited, my own research with co-authors shows that a one standard deviation net procurement shock not only increases inflation across all sectors, but after inflation rises for two quarters on impact, it remains positive for about six to seven quarters after that.",
        "As in an external terms of trade shock, which would push the Phillips curve of the economy upwards, compromising GDP growth and raising inflation in the medium term, an internal terms of trade shock via a rise in the MSP would do the same.",
        "The response to changes in the MSP would therefore need to be pursued in a systematic way to maintain durability of the medium-term 4% inflation target.",

        "Headline inflation eased to 4.4% in February after rising to a 17-month high of 5.2% in December, 2017.",
        "This fall was largely due to a significant seasonal drop in vegetable prices, along with other components of food.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged in February, having stayed at 5.2% since December, partly due to housing inflation driven by the direct effects of house rent allowance for government employees under the 7th central pay commission.",
        "Despite the recent fall in headline inflation, several upside risks prevail.",
        "The proposed link between the minimum support prices (MSPs) for _kharif crops with 1.5 times the cost of_ production may drive inflation up.",
        "Fiscal deficit slippage and the slower than expected fiscal consolidation, as well as the staggered impact of house rent allowance by state governments, may also exert pressure on inflation.",
        "The recent volatility in crude prices has also resulted in uncertainty regarding the inflation scenario.",
        "Further, the proposed increase in customs duty is undertaken in March 2018 signals high inflation expectations for both three-month-ahead and one-year-ahead horizons.",
        "Further, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) of the RBI suggests hardening of input prices, which may be passed on to consumers and lead to higher CPI inflation.",
        "On the output front, the estimated GDP growth is 6.6% for 2017-18, lower than 7.1% for 2016-17.",
        "Nevertheless, some positive signs of economic growth are visible, especially in revival of investment.",
        "Implementation of GST is stabilising and the recapitalization of public sector banks, as well as the steps towards NPA resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, are expected to contribute to economic growth.",
        "On the other hand, banking sector risks can be an impediment to sustainable growth.",
        "Separately, the possibility of an escalating trade war is a growing risk factor.",
        "Moreover, the Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in March 2018 presents a pessimistic outlook for General Economic Situation and Employment Scenario.",
        "This is supported Index, a harbinger of future economic activity, indicating dull prospects for economic growth.",
        "Exports Index, a predictor of the direction of exports growth, which is subdued, indicating that Indian export growth outlook remains restrained.",

        "Thus, with upside risks to inflation and lacklustre growth prospects, a wait and watch strategy with respect to evolving risks, along with _status quo in interest rates, is currently_ recommended.",
        "The headline inflation in January and February 2018 showed a sharper decline than what MPC had expected in its previous meeting.",
        "It is likely to show a lower print even during March 2018.",
        "From April 2018, however, it is expected to increase on account of unfavorable base cent by March 2019.",
        "Thus, in the baseline scenario, we are likely to be at or around the target rate of headline inflation 12 months down.",
        "There are, however, several uncertainties and concerns surrounding this forecast.",
        "These are: (i) There is a revival of economic growth but not to the level expected by RBI.",
        "Although the capacity utilization has improved to around 74 per cent, I feel, it is still far below the threshold required to induce substantial fresh investment.",
        "There is hardly any evidence on employment growth picking up to a level that would put upward pressure on the wage growth.",
        "Thus, continued existence of a negative output gap has to be considered.",
        "(ii) Fears of a trade war among major global players are turning increasingly realistic with likely adverse impact on our exports and costs of production.",
        "It may severely affect our growth recovery over the coming year.",
        "(iii) Oil prices have been fluctuating and both their direction and magnitude are difficult to predict for any possible impact on the headline inflation during the coming year.",
        "(iv) Concerns about the adequacy of monsoon rains and implementation of the revision in minimum support prices of different crops add another dimension to the inflation uncertainties.",
        "(v) Implementation of the revisions in HRA for employees of different states and related organizations (like universities, research institutes, municipal bodies, etc.)",
        "in line with the 7[th] CPC could raise the headline inflation substantially over time.",
        "Although it has to be seen through because it would be only statistical, it does impact CPI as well as CPI excluding food and fuel significantly for about a year.",
        "And if the implementation is staggered among states, it would take even longer.",
        "In this context, it is argued that the second round effects of such an increase have to be considered.",
        "My research shows that inflation dynamics have changed during the current decade making the second round effects less relevant.",
        "(vi) Slippage by the Centre from the fiscal consolidation path and its likely adverse impact on the headline inflation and the cost of borrowing are often raised as a major concern.",
        "In this context, as I had pointed out in the last MPC minutes, it is the combined (Centre and all States together) fiscal deficit that matters for the headline inflation.",
        "By now, 26 states have presented their budgets and their combined budgeted fiscal deficit is estimated to be 2.6 per cent of GDP.",
        "Thus, to a large extent, the fiscal slippage of the Centre is compensated by the fiscal discipline shown by the States.",
        "The net impact on the headline inflation on this count, therefore, is likely to be very limited.",
        "Moreover, there are expectations about the tax revenues exceeding the revised estimates for the year 2017-18, reducing the estimate of the fiscal slippage by the Centre.",
        "If the same buoyancy continues, it can substantially reduce the magnitude of the fiscal slippage next year.",
        "On the other hand, the slippage can occur for various reasons including the forthcoming elections in States and the Centre.",
        "(vii) The Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) during February 2018 shows that the expected headline inflation (CPI) 12 months down by the businesses is 4.1 per cent but is increasing of late.",
        "Similarly, the RBI survey of household inflation expectations also shows increasing trend.",
        "On account of all such uncertainties of impacts on headline inflation in both the directions, it is prudent to wait and watch the events play out before any decisive change in policy stance and/or rate can be considered.",
        "I, therefore, vote for maintaining a status quo on the policy rate and neutral stance.",
        "I maintain my vote for a 25 basis points increase in the policy rate.",
        "Underlying macroeconomic developments impart some urgency to commencing the withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "The ebbing of inflation in January and February will likely extend into the reading for March, given the continuing decline in prices of vegetables.",
        "Does it present a persuasive case for an easier/neutral monetary policy stance?",
        "In my view, that will be time-inconsistent and will push the achievement of the inflation target farther out in time, given the current assessment that the target is not likely to be achieved during the full course of 2018-19, absent policy action.",
        "It is important to recognise that volatility in the prices of vegetables is obscuring a clearer evaluation of underlying inflation pressures.",
        "An unseasonal spike in November has given way to a delayed seasonal easing in February and March, which should reverse by April-May.",
        "Accordingly, this transient supply shock, however favourable it might be, has to be looked through while setting monetary policy so that the focus is on the real risks to food inflation looming over the horizon from (a) increases in minimum support prices announced in the union budget; and (b) the shortfall in wheat output and the implications for prices of cereals.",
        "The main risks to the achievement of the target are festering in the category of CPI excluding food and fuel in which inflation has stubbornly risen above 5 per cent over the past three months.",
        "Over the course of 2018-19, inflation in this category is expected to peak close to 6 per cent in June and moderate in the rest of the year to settle at a little above 5 per cent.",
        "It is necessary, however, to adjust for the statistical impact of the HRA in assessing this trajectory.",
        "After the adjustment, the baseline path of inflation excluding food and fuel is one of monotonical hardening till the end of the year without the June peak.",
        "Meanwhile, upside risks in the form of international crude prices, rising raw material and other input prices, the slow return of pricing power among corporates, the spectre of trade wars and embedded tariff increases - which could re-price the normalization of monetary policy by systemic central banks have increased.",
        "Should the food situation turn adverse or overwhelm food management strategies, we will have to deal with inflation testing the upper tolerance limit of the inflation band.",
        "Households are reflecting these fears in their inflation expectations, and both bond and credit markets have been tightening interest rates well ahead of the MPC.",
        "Impulses of growth are strengthening.",
        "The turnaround in the pace of investment is the defining feature of 2017-18 in contrast to the consumption-led growth in preceding years.",
        "Foodgrains and horticulture production are set to scale new records.",
        "Manufacturing is on an accelerating mode and the recovery is broadening and encompassing an increasing number of constituent industries in its ambit.",
        "It is supported by rising sales growth, an uptick in seasonally adjusted capacity utilization, drawdown of finished goods inventories and upbeat business confidence even as the regaining of pricing power is helping to shore up profit margins.",
        "There are also indications of the capex cycle gradually starting up.",
        "It is important that these drivers be nurtured to full strength and traction, and not be frittered away by allowing inflation to get out of hand in an environment of fiscal slippages at the central and state levels, a current account deficit that is modest but on the rise, and balance sheets of banks and corporates still fragile.",
        "In my minutes of the February 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had flagged two reasons that had induced me to pause from voting to begin the process of price outlook, and two, growth recovery in the economy still being nascent.",
        "Uncertainty on these fronts has now receded.",
        "In spite of the US shale gas response to rising oil prices being robust, inventories have continued to dwindle.",
        "The combination of OPEC supply cuts and strengthening global demand appear to be keeping international oil prices at a relatively high level, and the volatility of prices around the high level has been relatively low in the past three to six months.",
        "The dwindling stock of inventories implies that a supply side disruption to any one critical source, for instance, due to geopolitical risk, could have a sharp upward impact on prices.",
        "On the domestic front, the lack of fiscal space to go easy on fuel cesses implies that prices at the pump will likely mirror movements in international prices.",
        "Since global commodity prices as a group are refusing to budge, the overall outlook is not comforting from the standpoint of domestic inflation.",
        "On the growth front, while we have not seen another print from the CSO since last policy, released during the week of MPC meeting, point to growing traction in the drivers underlying measure, which I personally prefer, shows near complete closure of the output gap due to the resilient credit growth over the past two quarters.",
        "This is further confirmed by high frequency data on rural and urban consumption, investment activity revival, and improvement in capacity utilisation.",
        "In my view, these healthy developments on the economic activity front are likely to remain durable due to steady progress in the time-bound resolution of twin balance-sheet problem affecting our banks and corporates.",
        "In view of the above referred developments since the last MPC meeting, I have moved substantially closer to switching from the neutral stance to beginning the process of withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "This is in spite of the softening of inflation in recent prints.",
        "Let me explain in some detail.",
        "- Recent prints have softened due primarily to easing of vegetable prices (contributing to over 90 per cent of softening of food inflation in February).",
        "Digging into specifics does not suggest that this is due to durable supply management in vegetables.",
        "Instead, reasonable conclusion is that vegetable prices continue to show seasonality over years, something amenable to monetary policy actions, and certainly not at short horizon of a few months at which it is likely to, and typically does, revert.",
        "- What concerns me is that the more persistent component of headline inflation, which is strengthened steadily from a trough of 3.8 per cent last June to 4.4 per cent in February HRA).",
        "This rise has been broad-based, consistent with the durability of a growth pick-up over this period, and also confirmed by input price pressures and selling price increases - The inflation trajectory over the entire twelve-month period is projected, despite the soft print in February, to remain above the MPC target rate of 4 per cent, on a quarter by quarter basis.",
        "Note that this is the case even after excluding the HRA impact.",
        "- Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank also expect the inflation to stay over 4 per cent for much of 2018-19.",
        "- While there is inevitable uncertainty around these inflation projections, I view the risks as tilted significantly to the upside given the continuing rise in the ex-food-and-fuel inflation.",
        "Besides oil prices, my another primary concern is the risk of fiscal slippages, at both the Centre and State levels, especially in the form of: `o` A shift away from capital expenditures towards revenue expenditures, as is already being seen in state expenditure to accommodate farm loan waivers; and, `o` Food price-support measures, on which further clarity is needed, but which clearly induce an upside bias to potential inflation risks (estimates vary widely from 10 basis points to close to 100 basis points depending on what measures are adopted).",
        "- Finally, as the Indian economy is economically as well as financially integrated with the global economy, a faster normalisation of interest rates by systemic central banks can also pose a major challenge to the external sector.",
        "I feel it is important to let some more hard data come in, especially on growth, and allow some more time to let the early skirmishes on the global trade front play out.",
        "I am, however, MPC meeting in June.",
        "Reinforcement of inflation-targeting credibility that such a shift would signal is crucial in my view for prudent macroeconomic management, on both the domestic and external sector fronts.",
        "CPI inflation moderated in January-February, led largely by a sharp decline in vegetable prices and continuing deflation in pulses.",
        "Fuel group inflation also moderated mainly on the back of a decline in liquefied petroleum gas inflation, reflecting softening in international prices.",
        "These developments, combined with the continued softening in vegetable prices in March, are expected to pull down the headline CPI inflation in Q4:2017-18 below the projection made in February.",
        "However, it is noteworthy that over the last three months (December-February), the monthly CPI headline inflation (year-on-year) adjusted for house rent allowance (HRA) revision has averaged 4.6 percent.",
        "Going forward, the combined effects of the observed moderation in food inflation in January-February and the expected further softening in March are likely to result in lower will be despite the likely seasonal reversal of food prices in the first half.",
        "Inflation expectations have firmed up, both for three-month and one-year ahead horizons.",

        "First, the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up headline inflation further over the baseline in 2018-19, and potentially induce second-round effects.",
        "Second, a pick-up in global growth may exert further pressure on crude oil and commodity prices with implications for domestic inflation.",
        "Third, the Union Budget 2018-19 has proposed revised guidelines for arriving at the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, although the exact magnitude of its impact on inflation cannot be fully assessed at this stage.",
        "Fourth, the Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on a number of items.",
        "Fifth, fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget could impinge on the inflation outlook.",

        "This may feed into inflation.",
        "Sixth, the confluence of domestic fiscal developments and normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies could further adversely impact financing conditions and undermine the confidence of external investors.",
        "There is, therefore, need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario in the coming months.",
        "There are also mitigating factors.",

        "Global demand is improving, which should help strengthen domestic investment activity.",
        "The focus of the Union Budget on the rural and infrastructure sectors is also a welcome development as it would support rural incomes and investment, and in turn provide a further push to aggregate demand and economic activity.",
        "On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out of private financing and investment.",

        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on April 4 and 5, 2018.",
        "Since the last review, there has been a sharp increase in headline inflation (November, 4.9%; December, 5.2%).",
        "The latest reading is, worryingly, led by rising inflation in all major groups.",
        "Both food and fuel inflation have also increased, with the usual seasonal of inflation have converged above 5%.",
        "Adverse supply side shocks could push the Phillips curve of the economy upward posing a strong risk to the medium-term inflation target of 4%.",
        "Inflation, excluding food and fuel (December, 5.2%) is up although this is primarily responding more to the recent increases in input costs, driven by a reversal of the international commodity cycle, rather than staff costs, driven by a tightening of the labour market, or higher capacity utilisation.",
        "This suggests that inflation excluding food and fuel may be increasing more because of cost-push factors, which will worsen the growth-inflation trade-off.",
        "There are fewer mitigating factors to rising inflation compared to two months ago.",
        "Rural wage growth continues to be moderate but with an uptick, possibly reflecting a rise in construction activity.",
        "The deflation in pulses continues but could reverse with the new procurement policy announced in the Union Budget of 2018-2019.",
        "At the current juncture though, stripped of cereals and vegetables (volatile items), the increase in inflation net of volatile items, from its trough in June 2017, is less pronounced.",
        "Both 3-month and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations are also stable.",
        "In my last review, I had flagged how increases in MSP by the government could lead to generalized inflation, and worsen monetary transmission, based on research (with coauthors).",
        "While details on the exact procurement policy are awaited, the enactment of a more elaborate procurement policy in the 2018-2019 Union Budget will put stress on state finances as well.",
        "Fiscal slippages in India are inflationary!",
        "With respect to economic growth, data trends have largely been positive in the last few months, as suggested by many high frequency indicators.",
        "My main concern in the last few reviews was whether animal spirits in the economy will sustain GDP growth beyond the base effect induced increases in Q3 and Q4 2017-2018.",
        "This looks increasingly likely.",
        "Profit margins in the manufacturing sector are improving, with sales being higher in real terms.",
        "The PMI in services increased in December and January.",
        "The RBI enterprise surveys also suggest a substantial improvement in demand conditions.",
        "Several high frequency activity indicators have picked up suggesting that the growth deceleration has troughed.",
        "The flow of financial resources by banks and non-banks is also picking up.",
        "It is highly possible however that current growth trends will make the economy accelerate into an inflationary phase.",
        "This needs to be watched with laser-like precision.",
        "Ultimately, any durable increase in growth in GDP however will depend on investment demand.",
        "The figure below, using the KLEMS database, plots growth in output per worker against growth in capital stock per worker between 1980 and 2011.",
        "While the figure is merely suggestive, it does indicate that output per worker has tracked capital per worker fairly closely during this period suggesting dynamics in output per worker in India in the medium term are described reasonably well by a Solow-Swan style model.",
        "Any durable increase in output per worker will only come about by increases in capital per worker.",
        "To that extent, the recent uptick in investment/GDP ratio is encouraging.",
        "Taking these considerations into account, I vote for a pause in the policy repo rate at 36.",
        "CPI inflation continued its upward trajectory in November and December 2017, climbing to a 17 month high of 5.2% in December, partly due to an unfavourable base effect.",
        "This increase was also driven by an increase in food prices, along with inflation in fuel due to a rise in global crude prices.",
        "CPI inflation excluding food and fuel also increased in December, partly due to housing inflation driven by the effects of house rent allowance for government employees under the 7[th] central pay commission.",
        "Going forward, several upside risks to inflation remain.",
        "These include the possibility of an increase in global commodity prices and higher crude oil prices.",
        "Fiscal deficit slippage and the slower than expected fiscal consolidation as well as the staggered impact of house rent allowance by state governments may also exert pressure on inflation.",
        "The proposal in the Budget to link the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops with 1.5 times the cost of production, may also drive inflation up, although its impact cannot be ascertained as yet.",
        "The Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on several items.",
        "Further, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) of the RBI suggests hardening of input prices which may and one-year-ahead forecast horizons.",
        "Meanwhile, the Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated), has increased in recent months, indicating an uptick in inflation pressures.",
        "At the same time, positive signs of economic growth are visible.",
        "To begin with, the implementation of the GST is stabilising.",
        "Other positive factors include the recapitalisation of public sector banks and steps towards NPA resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code.",
        "Credit growth has also increased in December.",
        "Steps have also been taken in the Union Budget to revive economic activity, with a focus on rural and infrastructure sectors.",
        "international leading indexes suggest that global growth will ease this year.",
        "Moreover, with growth, staying subdued, the Indian export growth outlook remains restrained.",
        "There is also concern about global financial market volatility against the backdrop of rising global bond yields and uncertainty regarding the normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies.",
        "Thus, with upside risks to inflation and lacklustre growth prospects, a wait and watch strategy with _status quo in policy interest rate and a neutral stance is currently_ recommended.",
        "Developments on inflation and growth fronts since the last meeting of MPC in December 2017 have been more or less on expected lines.",
        "Although the headline inflation was expected to rise in November and December 2017, the extent of increase was higher favourable base effect and seasonal factors.",
        "The expectation about recovery in the growth of GVA remained subdued in the Economic Survey 2017-18 in line with what I had anticipated in my statement in the last meeting of MPC.",
        "Capacity utilisation continues to be stubborn at around 72 per cent reflecting continued presence of excess capacity in manufacturing sectors.",
        "As I have been arguing, the output gap continues to be negative and expanding.",
        "Inflation expectations of households 12 months ahead show marginal decline over the previous round in spite of the headline inflation sharply picking up during the survey period.",
        "The latest Business Inflation Expectation Survey (BIES) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) with more than 2500 respondents finds that their expectation about costs 12 months ahead has risen by 40 basis points but still remains at 3.7 43.",
        "However, inflation trends need to be watched carefully.",
        "Although the base effects are uncertainties and serious upside risks.",
        "The fiscal space to accommodate future higher oil price shocks seems to be absent given the slippage in the Union budget for 2018-19.",
        "Impact of the increase in customs duty and MSP proposed in the budget on the headline inflation is again uncertain.",
        "Although there is substantial fiscal slippage by the Centre, the fiscal performance of major states needs to be watched.",
        "Their revenues are now more certain and the Centre has provided for an increased transfer of tax revenues to states by 0.2 percentage points of GDP in the budget.",
        "As a result, the fiscal discipline by states is a critical Centre.",
        "Moreover, the implementation of the HRA revisions by states and other bodies like universities and its likely impact on the headline inflation is again uncertain though its primary effect is only statistical.",
        "Under all these uncertainties and conflicting trends, prudence lies in following the policy of wait and watch and allow clearer picture to emerge.",
        "Hence, I vote for maintaining the status quo on both the policy rate and neutral stance.",
        "In April last year, I expressed a preference for a pre-emptive policy rate increase, sensing that inflation is rising out of the demonetisation trough.",
        "I voted, however, for holding the rate unchanged through the June and August meetings to allow transitory effects to fully pass.",
        "My vote for _status quo was maintained in August even though the Committee by_ majority decision reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points in that meeting.",
        "By the October meeting, my stance had been vindicated.",
        "Looking ahead, I saw inflation stripped of house rent allowance effects exceeding the target by the end of the year.",
        "in the second half of the year, I provided specific forward guidance.",
        "My vote for _status quo was conditioned to inflation staying within the target, with a_ readiness to raise the policy rate if inflation drivers strengthen.",
        "By the December meeting, the time had come to take guard, bringing to critical mass my stance articulated since April.",

        "Expectations are elevated and volatile.",
        "Fixed income markets are telling us that we have fallen behind the curve.",
        "In the near term outlook (up to mid-2018), inflation is likely to drift well above target.",
        "It is important to recognise that the expected easing of inflation in the outer months of the effect wanes.",
        "The target is in danger of getting out of reach and over the next few months, the upper tolerance band is under threat.",
        "This could seriously dent the credibility of the 50.",

        "If the the output gap is expected to close going forward.",
        "If the statistical reversal of the HRA effect is looked through, the real policy rate is below 1 per cent and could fall further absent policy action.",
        "This is completely misaligned with underlying fundamentals and the economy's prospects at a time when activity is picking up.",
        "In view of the prolonged period of _status quo, a series of rate increases may be_ warranted to remove excessive accommodation.",
        "The time to begin is upon us.",
        "I vote for an increase of 25 basis points in the policy rate to commence the withdrawal of accommodation.",
        "Headline inflation prints since last policy have been significantly above the target.",
        "While a part of this is statistical due to the Centre's HRA implementation, there has also been a rise in inflation sans HRA.",
        "A major concern has been the steep rise in oil prices coincidentally with (i) global rates and commodity cycles having turned up; and (ii) our fiscal deficit having overshot for this year and likely to do so next year too.",
        "Hence, even without Union Budget, risks to inflation seem clearly tilted on the upside.",
        "Indeed, RBI's projections at 55.",
        "Such an inflation scenario would imply a raise in policy rates by a pure inflation targeting central bank, in turn, implying a change in stance from \"neutral\" to \"withdrawal of accommodation.\"",
        "However, two reasons induced me to pause.",
        "First, an important factor determining inflation going forward is likely to be the shale gas production response to rising oil prices; while this response has been somewhat muted, its trigger out of dormancy could dampen oil prices swiftly.",
        "I would like to see whether this downside risk plays out in next few months to have a firmer grip on the medium-term inflation trajectory.",
        "Second, for a flexible inflation targeting framework, the growth trajectory relative to potential output has to be considered too.",
        "On this front, the output gap remains somewhat negative though it has been steadily closing.",
        "Structurally, the improving balance sheets of the banking system post recapitalisation package and the ongoing resolution of large stressed accounts have made the recent pick up in credit growth more sustainable.",
        "Real economic activity indicators also suggest a broad-based growth revival.",

        "In my view, the prolonged period of staying on hold is denting the credibility of the MPC's commitment to maintaining inflation at the centre of the target band.",
        "There is a rising risk that the public may start discounting this commitment: if it begins to believe that the MPC is willing to tolerate inflation in higher reaches, inflation expectations can be set adrift.",
        "The status quo is also dissipating the hard earned reputational bonus that accrued to the RBI for breaking the back of the high inflation episode of 2009-13.",
        "There was a lot of good luck then as international commodity prices collapsed, but good policy too as we set out a glide path of disinflation that took India out of the fragile five.",
        "The major upside risks to inflation that the MPC has worried about in past resolutions inflation expectations; professional forecasters' projections; input and selling prices captured are all flashing amber or red.",
        "Markets and financial institutions are already getting ahead of the curve.",
        "Continuing policy inaction is running the danger of allowing inflation outcomes to slip away from the centre of the target band.",
        "The gains of macroeconomic stability that have defined the recent period as its greatest achievement could get frittered away.",
        "Turning to growth, the economy is gathering speed.",
        "Buoyant sales growth, depleting inventories, rising capacity utilization and rising consumer optimism on spending, especially on discretionary items, all suggest that slack in the economy is being pulled in and the output gap is set to close.",
        "Consequently, demand-pull components are showing up in recent inflation readings.",
        "In this finely poised situation, inflation volatility can hamstring the new impulses of investment growth that have sprung up in recent quarters.",
        "In my view, the time has come for the MPC to act unanimously to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points in a closing sliver of opportunity.",
        "This will demonstrate our resolve to return inflation to the centre of the target band.",
        "Monetary policy has to step in before it is too late and guide the economy along a non-accelerating inflation growth path.",
        "In the Minutes of the April 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had indicated my growing concern around underlying inflationary pressures.",
        "These pressures have been manifesting as a strengthening of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation excluding There has been a rise in input costs due to supply shocks such as the sharp oil price surge witnessed over the past nine months.",
        "The strengthening of inflation also reflects aggregate demand pressures, which are confirmed in the now almost-closed output gap, improved capacity utilization figures, and a significant pick up in credit growth.",
        "As a result, the projection for medium-term headline CPI inflation has become firmer on the upside; it has moved closer to 5% and away from 4%, the latter being the mandated target of the MPC.",
        "The inflationary pressure also seems to be experienced by the common man.",
        "The uniform picture of hardening of inflation expectations whichever way one looks at the data.",
        "Most notably, the 3-month ahead and 12-month ahead inflation expectations have increased sharply by 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, since the last survey.",
        "They are likely explained by the fact that petrol and diesel prices carry salience: fuel prices are in the face and generalise rapidly through transportation costs into prices of general goods and services.",
        "A key uncertainty at present relates to the oil price development over medium-term horizon that monetary policy operates at.",
        "Robust global growth, OPEC and Russian supply cuts, supply shock in Venezuela, and geo-political uncertainty around the Iranian supply have all pushed international crude prices uncomfortably high in a short span of time.",
        "The shape of supply when it is needed.",
        "The US shale gas response appears to not have been enough as of yet to dampen this stock-out risk since some of the supply faces pipeline-infrastructure headwinds in reaching the markets.",
        "The one respite for headline inflation prints has been the continuing benign food inflation where seasonal pickup has remained muted due to a collapse in the prices of onions and tomatoes.",
        "This has imparted a short-run softening to inflation projections keeping them contained in the first half of 2018-19 in spite of the rising momentum in CPI ex-food, fuel and HRA.",
        "However, if the seasonal pick-up does manifest in the first half at some point, then the headline prints will have little abatement from any of its constituents.",
        "Under such a scenario, any upward pressure on food prices such as through generous minimum support prices (MSPs) would exacerbate headline inflation pressures.",
        "Factoring in these considerations, there is no alternative to raising the policy rate by 25 bps so as to signal concern about underlying inflation, manage inflation expectations, and guard proactively against a further increase in inflation.",
        "However, considerable uncertainties around oil and food prices as well as the playing out of trade wars and global financial market outcomes led me to keep the stance neutral.",
        "It will allow the MPC to determine in a flexible manner what further monetary policy response is warranted based on an ongoing assessment of the inflation situation, inflation expectations and growth prints in the coming months.",
        "crude oil prices have risen sharply by over 12 per cent even as there was some moderation in recent days.",
        "On the positive side, food inflation has continued to be benign.",
        "On the whole, inflation in March and April has behaved more or less on the lines of the path projected in the April resolution.",
        "Two developments are noteworthy from the standpoint of price stability.",
        "First, inflation (CPI ex-HRA) has averaged 4.4 per cent since November 2017.",
        "Second, inflation expectations of households have risen significantly as reflected in the May 2018 56.",
        "Looking ahead, projected inflation for Q4:2018-19 (at 4.7 percent) is 30 bps higher than that in the April resolution.",
        "The baseline inflation path faces several uncertainties, viz., (i) the outlook for oil prices; (ii) continuing volatility in global financial markets; (iii) the risk even as the pass-through to output prices has remained muted so far; (iv) the impact of the likely revision in the MSP formula; and (v) second round impact on inflation on account of the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments, though the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through.",
        "However, a normal monsoon, by keeping food inflation benign, could act as a mitigating factor.",
        "Domestic growth has strengthened with the Q4:2017-18 print at a seven-quarter high and now appears to be on a sustainable path.",
        "Investment activity, in particular, has accelerated.",
        "There has also been a pick-up in manufacturing and this is manifested in an increase in capacity utilisation.",
        "The services sector has been resilient with several high frequency indicators continuing to show robust growth in recent months even as PMI services moved slightly into contraction in May.",
        "Bank credit growth has continued to improve.",
        "The recent increase in oil prices, by impacting disposable incomes, may have some adverse impact on private consumption.",
        "On the whole, however, economic activity continues to be resilient with GDP growth for 2018-19 projected at 7.4 per cent, same as in the April policy.",
        "Inflation risks have increased since the April policy.",
        "I, therefore, vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.",
        "In view of prevailing uncertainties, it is apposite to maintain the neutral stance so as to respond to the evolving situation in a flexible manner.",

        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent.",
        "standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Since the last MPC meeting in August 2018, global economic activity has remained resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is clouded by several uncertainties.",
        "Among advanced economies (AEs), the United States (US) economy appeared to have sustained pace in Q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and robust industrial activity.",

        "The Russian economy has been gathering steam with the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on rising oil prices.",
        "In Brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in Q2, supported by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival.",
        "The South African economy slipped into recession in Q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect.",
        "Growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile production and sales.",
        "Crude oil prices eased during the first half of August on concerns of reduced demand from EMEs due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and accentuated by rising supplies.",
        "However, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced supplies due to sanctions on Iran and falling US stockpiles.",
        "Base metal prices witnessed selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies.",

        "Global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major AEs, the spreading of contagion risks from specific EMEs, and geopolitical developments.",
        "Among AEs, equity markets in the US touched a new high, driven by technology stocks, while in Japan, they were boosted by the weak yen.",
        "In contrast, stock markets in the Euro area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states.",
        "Sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for EME equities.",
        "The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has traded sideways, falling on dovish Fed guidance only to recover by hardened in September on risk aversion following the sharp rise in financial market volatility in yield curve management policy.",

        "Growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail credit growth.",
        "However, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated, largely due to a high base.",
        "The growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand.",
        "In spite of import growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on aggregate demand.",
        "On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated in Q1, underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and generalised across firm sizes.",
        "Agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries.",
        "In contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat, largely on account of a high base.",
        "Construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter.",
        "The fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in August placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year.",
        "The progress of the south-west monsoon has been marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in precipitation.",

        "This bodes well for the rabi sowing season.",
        "Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), accelerated in June-July 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils, auto components and spares, and accessories.",

        "Capacity utilisation (CU) declined from 75.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19, while seasonally adjusted CU increased by 1.8 production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation.",

        "High-frequency indicators of services in July and August present a mixed picture.",

        "Some softening of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline.",
        "Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent.",
        "Inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables.",

        "Exports maintained double digit growth in July and August 2018, driven mainly by petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.",
        "However, imports grew faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold, coal, electronic goods and machinery.",
        "This led to a widening of the trade deficit to US$ 35.3 billion in July-August 2018 from US$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in Q1:201819.",
        "However, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a year ago.",
        "On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved in April-July 2018.",

        "Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2:2018-19, August, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.",
        "Going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors.",
        "First, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its trajectory in the second half of the year.",
        "Inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture.",
        "The risk to food inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the first advance record.",
        "An estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July has been factored in the baseline projections.",
        "Secondly, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by US$ 13 a barrel, since the last resolution.",
        "Thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with EME currencies depreciating significantly.",
        "Finally, the HRA effect came off its peak in June and is dissipating gradually on expected lines.",
        "Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 1).",
        "Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20.",
        "Turning to the growth outlook, the GDP print of Q1:2018-19 was significantly higher than that projected in the August resolution.",
        "Private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes.",
        "Improving capacity utilisation, larger FDI inflows and increased financial resources to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity.",
        "However, both global and domestic financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity.",
        "Rising crude oil prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins of corporates.",
        "This adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass on increases in their input costs.",
        "Uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports.",
        "Tailwinds from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade and the 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the August resolution, mainly due to the strong base effect (Chart 2).",
        "While the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the August 2018 print.",
        "The outlook is clouded with several uncertainties.",
        "First, the government announced in September measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices.",
        "Secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate.",
        "The recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation.",
        "Thirdly, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook.",
        "Fourthly, a sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher pass-through to retail prices for both firming of input costs in Q2:2018-19 and Q3.",
        "However, global commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse influence on input costs.",
        "Fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and crowding out private sector investment.",
        "Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by the state governments may push up headline inflation.",
        "While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects on inflation.",
        "The inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist.",
        "Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.",
        "and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook.",
        "It is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "Regarding the policy repo rate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr.",
        "Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for an increase in the policy rate by 25 bps.",

        "Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of changing the stance to calibrated tightening.",
        "Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to keep the neutral stance unchanged.",
        "The minutes of 30.",
        "The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from December 3 to 5, 2018.",
        "Anchoring inflationary expectations, which are shaped by the target, is extremely important in an inflation targeting regime.",
        "If there is substantial deviation of inflationary expectations in relation to the target, by failing to react with the policy interest rate, we will lose credibility and reduce our capacity to influence expectations.",
        "While I am comforted by the decline in median inflationary expectations of households expectations are now higher by 180 basis points over the September 2017 round.",
        "Meanwhile, the three-month median inflationary expectations increased by 50 bps compared to the previous round, with a cumulative increase of about 220 basis points over the September 2017 round.",
        "What makes these cumulative increases in inflationary expectations salient, is that they risk being unanchored by both the 7% nominal depreciation in the INR and the USD 13 a barrel increase in the price of oil, since the August 2018 policy.",
        "Another factor is the nature and scope of MSP implementation, details of which are still not clear.",
        "My own projections with the above variables suggest that these factors will push inflation beyond the Q1 FY19-20 projection of 4.8% made by the RBI.",
        "Doing so risks the possibility of the un-anchoring of inflationary expectations which will impair our ability to keep headline inflation durably at 4%.",
        "There has been a slight moderation in CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel to 6.0% in August, from 6.2% in July, which is comforting.",
        "The elevated value of ex food and fuel inflation is consistent with a nearly-closed output gap which should be carefully watched.",
        "remains resilient, and the growth in consumer non-durables, which was lack-luster before, has picked up.",
        "manufacturing sector continued to improve with the latest round of the RBI industrial outlook survey (of 1095 manufacturing companies) showing strong sentiments on production and order seasonally adjusted increase in capacity utilization at a 20-quarter high.",
        "Firms expect demand inventories indicate that producers are stocking up in anticipation of higher demand in coming quarters.",
        "Upward pressure on input and staff costs continue to push up selling prices, posing a risk to headline inflation.",
        "The most recent PMI manufacturing corroborates this, showing an uptick in input prices and output prices, although the pass through is lower.",
        "What worries me on the pick up in growth is the dismal consumer confidence numbers, durability of growth is better sustained if it is supported by growing consumer confidence.",
        "Notwithstanding this, I continue to remain sanguine about current and medium term growth prospects as in the last policy.",
        "Despite the two hikes in the policy rate in the last two policies, the data since August risks impairing our ability to keep headline inflation durably at 4%.",
        "I say this fully cognizant of the trade-off facing the MPC: moving too quickly and needlessly shortening the growth turnaround or, calibrating the rate hikes too slowly, and risking an over-heating in an economy with a nearly closed output gap.",
        "Given the strong possibility of the un-anchoring of inflationary to act now.",
        "We should not allow the commitment to the 4% target to be flexible.",
        "Headline inflation softened to 3.7 per cent in August from 4.2 per cent in July and 4.9 per cent in June, mainly due to the drop in food inflation from 3.1 per cent in June to 1.7 per cent in July and 0.9 per cent in August.",
        "Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of an calculations) also moderated from 4.6 per cent in June to 3.4 per cent in August, while CPI excluding food and fuel and adjusted for the impact of an increase in HRA fell from 5.7 per cent in June to 5.4 per cent in August.",
        "At the same time, various surveys provide mixed signals Households points towards an increase of 50 basis points in three-month-ahead inflation firms expect higher cost of raw materials, input prices and selling prices.",
        "The manufacturing and services PMIs also signal a similar trend.",
        "Looking forward, the downside risks to the inflation outlook include benign food inflation.",
        "The recent cuts in excise duty on petrol and diesel are expected to moderate retail with potential pass-through effects on inflation.",
        "Moreover, with EME currencies depreciating against the US dollar, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook.",
        "Additionally, fiscal slippages by the government may have adverse implications for market volatility, and may crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation.",
        "The upside risks associated with an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) and the HRA still persist, although the latter has somewhat moderated.",
        "Risks due to an increase in state level HRAs and input prices also prevail.",
        "Thus, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook.",
        "On the output side, GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018-19 was strong, with robust growth in private consumption.",
        "However, downside risks to investment activity include an increase in input prices and crude oil prices and tightening of global and domestic financial conditions, including the recent developments in the non-banking sector.",
        "Despite a depreciating rupee, growth in exports may also be hampered due to geopolitical risks, trade war and slowing global economy.",
        "Indeed, growth in the Indian Leading Export Index, a predictor of the direction of exports growth maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, remains in the doldrums, indicating an unfavourable Indian export growth outlook.",
        "This is consistent with future economic activity, has firmed lately, pointing to somewhat improved economic growth prospects.",
        "In sum, while inflation has softened, upside risks to inflation remain, along with some downside risks to output growth.",
        "The policy repo rate has already been increased in the past two consecutive meetings of the MPC (June and August), each time by 25 basis points.",
        "Due to the transmission lags, the effects of these may take time to play out.",
        "It is therefore best to pause and wait and watch while maintaining a vigil on inflation.",
        "I therefore vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "At the same time, given the upside risks to inflation, I also vote for a change in the stance from neutral to calibrated tightening.",
        "inflation forecast for July and August substantially exceeded the actual reading, its medium term forecast would also have to be revised downward substantially.",
        "As expected, this has happened.",
        "The RBI forecast for the headline CPI inflation in July and August 2018 turned out to be May and June 2018 headline inflation forecasts.",
        "RBI has, therefore, revised its short to medium term forecast of headline inflation significantly downward even after considering revisions in its baseline scenario of higher oil prices and exchange rate.",
        "As I had argued in the last meeting, moreover, the household inflationary expectations 12 months ahead have come down (by 30 bps) as per the latest RBI survey.",
        "The growth forecast for the Indian economy considering both the latest upside and downside risks has remained the same (7.4 percent) as during the previous policy rate pre-emptively by 25 bps.",
        "Therefore, now there is no case for any hike in the policy rate this time.",
        "This is the time for a pause to allow the consecutive rate hikes to sink in the system and settle down.",
        "I, therefore, vote for status quo on both the policy rate and the neutral stance.",
        "More specific reasons for my vote are: the rate of depreciation is substantially lower in terms of trade weighted Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), because other currencies have also depreciated against US Dollar.",
        "It is the depreciation in NEER that affects headline inflation.",
        "As a result, its impact on inflation is not likely to be very substantial.",
        "ii) While the oil price increase has been substantial, the following two aspects need to be explicitly considered for its impact on the headline inflation: (a) it has a lagged effect on inflation depending on its effective pass-through including revisions in domestic taxes; and (b) productivity improvement or revised Input-Output ratios in the oil using productive activities could off-set to a considerable extent the adverse impact of price rise in oil.",
        "iii) The impact of House Rent Allowance (HRA) revisions as per the recommendation of 7[th] CPC in the central and state public sector enterprises, autonomous bodies, universities and other organizations that provide housing to their employees should ideally be seen through as we have been doing for the central government employees (because it is purely statistical).",
        "However, this impact has not been separated due to data problems.",
        "Since such households would form a significant proportion of the CSO sample households (almost similar to the one for the central government employees) for estimating housing CPI, there is a considerable overestimation of the effective inflation rate for the headline and more so for the CPI-ex-food and fuel.",
        "In short, the effective inflation forecasts for the short to medium term are much less than what RBI considers because of the lack of precise information.",
        "There is an urgent need to fix this problem so that right data inputs are considered for policy actions.",
        "However, till this statistical of headline inflation forecast from the targeted 4 percent as a major concern requiring any rate action.",
        "iv) The US economy has almost peaked and is only likely to go down from there.",
        "Therefore, further rate hikes in US may not be as attractive to global investors as before.",
        "As far as the Indian economy is concerned, the real interest rate is significantly higher than 2 per cent even after considering the inflationary expectation of businesses 12 months ahead of about 4.36 percent as per the latest IIM Ahmedabad survey results for August 2018 or the further by a rate hike at this point.",
        "v) Finally, the headline inflation forecast 12 months ahead by RBI is on a higher side according to me.",
        "This is also because the extent to which RBI has considered the impact of MSP revision on inflation is unrealistically high in my opinion.",
        "Considering all these points, status quo in both the neutral stance and policy rate at this point is the best option.",
        "In its third bi-monthly resolution of August, the MPC had expected inflation to ease in the second quarter of 2018-19 and had brought down its forecast for that quarter by 30 basis points relative to the projection in June.",
        "In my minutes in August, I anticipated the soft inflation encounter a soft patch in the second quarter, but it will resume an upward trajectory in the second inflation expectations, but abundant precaution and decisiveness in quelling risks to the target is warranted if the hard-earned gains in terms of macroeconomic stability and credibility have to be 48.",
        "Thus, the projections turned out to be directionally correct, although they overestimated the levels of inflation in these months.",
        "In view of the reasonable reliability of the forecasts in terms of direction, inflation appears to have troughed and is projected to rise from September, exceeding the target from the fourth quarter of 2018-19 and the first quarter of 2019-20 in an environment suffused with upside risks.",
        "Disconcertingly, global risks to inflation from crude prices and financial market turbulence are materialising on an ongoing basis.",
        "Corporate finances suggest that it is only a matter of time before firms pass through heightened input costs more aggressively into selling prices.",
        "Food inflation is imparting a downside under the influence of a deep cyclical downswing in the prices of some constituents and irregular downturns in others.",
        "Meanwhile, aggregate domestic demand, as measured by GDP growth, appears to have quickened on to a higher trajectory (8 per cent) during January-June 2018.",
        "Slack has been pulled in and capacity utilisation is getting stretched.",
        "Rural and urban spend is strengthening to a point where aggregate demand, especially private consumption, is likely running ahead of the supply response, even as the outlook for agriculture, manufacturing and construction is brightening and a gradual upturn is taking hold in various services sectors.",
        "The evolving macroeconomic configuration warrants an appropriate policy response.",
        "With the downward level shift in the projections relative to the August resolution, especially during January-June 2019, it is reasonable to keep the policy rate on hold in this meeting and to monitor the cumulative 50 basis points increase in June and August as it works its way through expectations of one year ahead inflation, while professional forecasters have revised downwards their outer forecasts of headline inflation.",
        "Yet, inflation is set to rise over the period ahead in an environment in which the balance of risks is shifting to the upside.",
        "Monetary policy needs to move to high alert, and this needs to be reflected in a pro-active policy stance.",
        "Overarchingly, assigns appropriate instruments to goals in order to secure efficient policy outcomes.",
        "Since the August policy, food inflation has surprised dramatically on the downside.",
        "Seasonal pickup in prices of vegetables and fruits in summer months was simply missing due to a combination of increased _mandi arrivals, export policies and other supply management_ measures.",
        "This, coupled with a normal monsoon, has shifted RBI's food inflation projections significantly downward.",
        "Elsewhere, fuel inflation continues its rapid upward march.",
        "While inflation excluding food and fuel has eased marginally due to lower momentum in certain goods and services, it remains at elevated levels.",
        "International crude oil prices keep surging as Iran sanctions approach, creating a difficult choice between pass-through to the pump prices and fiscal or quasi-fiscal absorption through excise cuts.",
        "The rising oil prices also coincide with the misfortune of weaker current account balance, inducing financial market volatility which raises imported inflation, though the direct impact of oil price on inflation _via the consequent fare price impact is much_ pricing power is returning to firms.",
        "While there was mild softening in the 12-month ahead inflation expectations of expectations showed a sharp uptick.",
        "I am particularly concerned about the near 200 basis points increase in the 3-month and 12-month inflation expectations of households, based on the surveys of September 2017 to September 2018.",
        "Households are telling us that their inflation outlook has moved palpably upwards.",
        "Business expectations of headline inflation as well as input costs are showing similar trends, rising steadily in RBI's and other surveys.",
        "target of 4%, in spite of the benign food inflation outlook.",
        "Between the time the projections were finalised for the Monetary Policy Report (specifically, October 1) and today (October 5), oil prices have risen steeply, without any signs of durable supply adjustment amidst strong global demand.",
        "Growth has been reasonably buoyant as evidenced by the real economic activity indicators for both the rural economy and the urban counterpart.",
        "Our estimates of the output gap suggest it has virtually closed as per the traditional measures; my preferred finance-neutral output gap measure has in fact turned positive due to asset price growth and especially non-food credit growth that is now in excess of the nominal GDP growth rate.",
        "In such a milieu, the likelihood of oil prices remaining elevated rules out a rate cut anytime soon.",
        "Second round effects of the steep oil price rise can generalise causing inflation expectations to unhinge.",
        "Even if pass-through to pump prices is made less than one for one, inflation risk would generalise through fiscal slippage.",
        "Given these factors, and given the flexible inflation-targeting mandate of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), it seems important to signal commitment to keeping to the mandate and move forward carefully at an appropriate time, allowing the economy to adjust to the past two back-to-back rate hikes while being vigilant of any emerging inflationary pressures.",
        "Hence, I vote for not to raise the policy rate but change the stance of monetary policy to 61.",
        "Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees moderated significantly from 4.6 per cent in June 2018 to 3.8 per cent in July and further to 3.4 per cent in August, reversing the trend of previous three months.",
        "Food inflation continued to surprise on the downside, declining sharply from 3.1 per cent in June to 0.9 per cent by August in the absence of a seasonal pick up in prices of key vegetables and fruits in summer months.",
        "Inflation in items other than food and fuel also moderated due mainly to softening in housing, clothing and transportation.",
        "However, inflation in the fuel group increased reflecting higher international petroleum product prices.",
        "Overall, actual inflation turnouts in July and August were lower than the projections set out in the August resolution of the MPC.",
        "Going forward, excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in continues to face several upside pressures, which include: (i) uncertainty surrounding the impact of the increase in minimum support prices of kharif crops on food inflation; (ii) surge in crude oil prices; (iii) heightened volatility in financial markets of emerging economies; (iv) a further with rising input costs, may impact price and wage setting behaviour, though it is comforting that one-year ahead inflation expectations have moderated; (v) the risk of fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state level; and (vi) second round effects on inflation on account of the staggered HRA revisions by various state governments, though the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through.",
        "The GDP growth print for Q1 of 2018-19 touched a high of 8.2 per cent, driven by robust private consumption and investment activity, suggesting that growth impulses, thus far, continue to be buoyant.",

        "Going forward, consumption is expected to be sustained.",

        "Moderation in inflation in the last two months has lowered the projected inflation trajectory.",
        "I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "Recognising that inflation risks have been persistent, and to reaffirm the commitment to securing the mandated 4 per cent inflation target on a durable basis, it is apposite to change the stance of the current rate cycle, a cut in the policy repo rate is off the table, and we are not obliged to increase the rate at every policy meeting.",

        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",

        "Slowdown in agricultural GVA was largely the outcome of tepid growth in profitability of manufacturing firms, pulled down largely by a rise in input costs, while that in mining and quarrying turned negative, caused by a contraction in output of crude oil and natural gas.",

        "Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards.",
        "Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data.",
        "Turning to growth projections, although Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October policy, GDP growth in H1 has been broadly along the line in the April policy when for the year as a whole GDP growth was projected at 7.4 per cent Going forward lower rabi sowing may adversely affect agriculture and hence rural demand.",
        "Financial market volatility, slowing global demand and rising trade tensions pose negative risk to exports.",
        "However, on the positive side, the decline in earnings and raising private consumption through higher disposable incomes.",
        "Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also portends well for new capacity additions.",

        "Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook.",
        "First, inflation projections incorporate benign food prices based on the realised outcomes of food inflation in recent months.",
        "The prices of several food items are at unusually low levels and there is a risk of sudden reversal, especially of volatile perishable items.",
        "Secondly, available data suggest that the effect of revision in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July on prices has been subdued so far.",
        "However, uncertainty continues about the exact impact of MSP on inflation, going forward.",
        "Thirdly, the medium-term outlook for crude oil prices is still uncertain due to global demand conditions, geo-political tensions and decision of OPEC which could impinge on supplies.",
        "Fourthly, global financial markets continue to be volatile.",
        "Sixthly, fiscal slippages, if any, at the centre/state levels, will influence the inflation outlook, heighten market volatility and crowd out private investment.",
        "Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by State Governments may push up headline inflation.",
        "While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, it will be watchful of any second-round effects on inflation.",
        "The MPC noted that the benign outlook for headline inflation is driven mainly by the unexpected softening of food inflation and collapse in oil prices in a relatively short period of time.",
        "Excluding food items, inflation has remained sticky and elevated, and the output gap remains virtually closed.",
        "The MPC also noted that even as escalating trade tensions, tightening of global financial conditions and slowing down of global demand pose some downside risks to the domestic economy, the decline in oil prices in recent weeks, if sustained, will provide tailwinds.",
        "The acceleration in investment activity also bodes well for the medium-term growth potential of the economy.",
        "The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "In this context, fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity.",
        "Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and maintain the stance of calibrated tightening.",

        "The decline in the three-month inflationary expectations number, but unchanged one-year ahead expectations number probably 30.",
        "In the October policy, I had also mentioned that two interlaced variables pose the potential of un-anchoring inflationary expectations, and thereby making it difficult to ensure price stability on an enduring basis: the nominal depreciation of the Rupee, and the increase in the price of oil.",
        "Since October, there was a substantial, though unanticipated, reversal in the price of oil, and by December, it was lower by over 29% compared to its October peak.",
        "There was also a strengthening of the Rupee by close to 4.6% (Dec 4 over Oct 5).",
        "Food inflation also fell to -0.1% in October.",
        "If oil and food prices stay lower for longer, this will help inflationary expectations taper.",
        "However, given the buoyancy in oil, and the risks of imported inflation from movements in the exchange rate, both variables need to be carefully watched.",
        "The evolution of MSP-inflation dynamics also needs to be carefully watched, although this risk to inflation projections appears mitigated compared to a few months ago.",
        "The elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel (6.1%) at a 3-month high continues to be problematic.",
        "Most sub-groups of inflation excluding food and fuel, other than clothing and footwear, have registered upticks.",

        "On the flip side, there is also the possibility of a rebound in crude oil prices due to supply factors.",

        "In sum, while inflation has softened, upside risks to inflation remain.",
        "It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil.",
        "I therefore vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.",
        "At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.",
        "Drastic and sudden changes in external economic environment have taken place after the last meeting of MPC in October 2018.",
        "Should these changes evoke a response through an appropriate policy action?",
        "- yes, if they are not purely downward revision of the forecast of inflation 12 months ahead to a substantial extent in response to those developments, is a clear indication of their long-term impact on the economy.",
        "Thus, a policy response is called for.",
        "If there is no policy action in response to such a major favourable shock, MPC would run the risk of being considered neither current nor relevant!",
        "With inflation forecast coming down by around 120 basis points and quarterly growth forecasts marginally revised downward opening up output gap going forward, there is hardly any justification in retaining calibrated tightening stance.",
        "In my opinion, this would be the right time to cut the rate and bring the unduly high real interest rates in the country back to around 2 per cent.",
        "It was, however, unfortunate that in October 2018, MPC had changed its stance to calibrated tightening with 5:1 majority despite my unsuccessful persuasion to maintain neutral stance.",
        "As a result, any rate cut is off the table for now and any such action would not be advisable at this point.",
        "The best we can do under the circumstance is to hold the rate, but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties.",
        "We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in 43.",
        "More specific reasons for my vote on the rate and the stance are: inflation forecasts, there are downside risks that cannot be overlooked: Oil price uncertainties are on both the directions; Qatar has opted out of OPEC and it can set a trend for others; OPEC meeting can go either way; the ultimate impact on oil prices would be determined by faithful implementation of its decision by all members; and role of USA in this matter cannot be ignored.",
        "ii) Similarly, Federal Reserve has practically changed its stance on rate hikes in future.",
        "Moreover, the USA economy is not likely to be very strong over time consistently.",
        "iii) Fiscal slippage is possible but the extent of it may not warrant any panic because its impact on inflation may not be significant and will be felt, if at all, with a considerable lag.",
        "iv) Real interest rate in the economy is very high.",
        "Even ignoring the issues concerning upward bias in the current measurement of inflation, it is substantially in excess of 200 basis points and is one of the highest in the world.",
        "v) Although the MPC resolution says that inflationary expectations one year ahead as per the latest RBI survey is constant compared to the previous survey, most of the 18 cities surveyed show a decline in the household inflationary expectation one year ahead.",
        "Only a few cities show an increase that neutralizes the decline observed in majority of cities.",
        "This brings to the fore the measurement issue for inflationary expectation in quantitative terms.",
        "We should be looking at the inflationary expectations of households not only in the urban cities but also in the smaller towns and the rural areas where inflation has come down significantly in recent times.",
        "In all likelihood, their inflationary expectation would be declining.",
        "Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere (EPW, Nov. 17, 2018), there is a need to consider expectation of businesses about the CPI headline inflation.",
        "The IIMA survey on them shows a marked decline of about 30 basis points.",
        "Thus, in the aggregate, the inflationary expectation in the country as a whole one year ahead seems to be declining and not remaining the same.",
        "Under such circumstances, retaining the stance of calibrated tightening seems totally inconsistent and unjustified.",
        "All these points require a change in the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral to take care of several uncertainties on both sides so that a rate decision can be appropriately data driven in future.",
        "I vote for status quo on the policy repo rate and for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening.",
        "In its October 2018 meeting, the MPC anticipated the softening of headline inflation in the months ahead, revising its forecast down by 90 basis points in Q3: 2018-19 and by 30 basis points in Q4, and this sentiment was also reflected in individual minutes.",
        "The actual outturns for September and October undershot even the revised projections substantially, with prices of food unexpectedly sinking into deflation.",
        "In my view, the Indian economy is experiencing the onset of positive supply shocks as reflected in the sizable easing of prices of food and petroleum products, which could reverse.",
        "Accordingly, they should be looked through, while remaining alert to spillovers to the rest of inflation which is already elevated and rising.",
        "Households have ignored this unusual softening of inflation prints and have kept their 12-months ahead expectations unchanged, while professional forecasters have remain pessimistic about the price situation, citing it as the main factor influencing their perceptions of worsening general economic conditions.",
        "Corporates assess that input cost pressures will remain firm.",
        "Based on current reckoning, the MPC projects inflation to rise above the target in the first half of 2019-20.",
        "Taking these factors into account, I reiterate that although softer inflation prints could likely lull inflation expectations, abundant precaution and decisiveness in quelling risks to the target are warranted if the hard-earned gains in terms of macroeconomic stability and credibility are to be preserved.",
        "sequential moderation, but this needs to be caveated by the base effect driven bump in the previous quarter; on a year-on-year basis, though, there has been a marked capacity utilisation in manufacturing; non-food credit growth; capital goods imports; growth being sustained.",
        "Annual real GDP growth will likely accelerate in 2018-19 from its level a year ago.",
        "On the production side, the momentum of activity would be underpinned by buoyancy in manufacturing and some improvement in services sector performance.",
        "With average inflation gradually converging to target, these growth impulses can be maintained by ensuring that the expansion remains sustainable.",
        "It is in this context that my preference is for keeping the policy rate unchanged.",
        "With inflation projected to rise above 4 per cent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term.",
        "Since the October 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, there have been two downward surprises to realised inflation.",
        "First, food inflation has had an unexpectedly large collapse, again in vegetables and fruits, but somewhat more broad-based than the inflation decline in preceding months; the collapse has been sharper in rural inflation than in urban inflation.",
        "Secondly, international crude oil prices that had been simmering to levels subsided as the curve has flattened now compared to its sharp backwardation shape in early October.",
        "The oil price crash, in turn, has improved external sector prospects for India and caused the currency to strengthen appreciably, reducing the magnitude of imported inflation.",
        "Together, these factors have resulted in an extraordinary downward revision in have also been extraordinarily volatile, making it difficult to make a complete sense of recent data.",
        "First, it is not easy to ascertain fully at this stage the nature of the collapse of food inflation seen in recent months particularly in terms of its implications for the food inflation outlook over the medium term.",
        "A clearer assessment is particularly clouded by divergence in the direction of price movements in data in key food items provided by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) and realised food inflation for October.",
        "Such divergence in the direction is rarely observed.",
        "Further examination of data is necessary to understand with greater clarity the drivers of food deflation.",
        "Secondly, market indicators of uncertainty in international crude oil prices remain high, reflecting the unexpectedly large gyrations in their movement this year and upcoming geo-political risks such as OPEC supply decision and trade war markets was around 25% per annum (p.a.)",
        "in October, which rose to around 45% p.a following the oil price crash.",
        "This is a rather high level of uncertainty embedded in expectations of market participants.",
        "Thirdly, inflation excluding food and fuel remains persistently high.",
        "It is over cost pressures are still high for firms and expected to remain elevated (consistent with both closing of the output gap and improvement in capacity utilisation beyond the long period average).",
        "This is expected to result in cost pass-through to consumers in the coming months.",
        "Fifthly, median household inflation expectations have softened at 3-month horizon by 40 basis points but remain unchanged for 12-month horizon.",
        "Over a 12month period during which the Reserve Bank has raised the policy rate by 50 basis points (bps), median household expectations of inflation for 3-month horizon have risen by 150 bps and for 12-month horizon by 120 bps.",
        "Finally, the risk of a fiscal slippage at the center and/or state levels appears to be considered within the realm of reasonable possibility.",
        "As such, the sharp decline in oil prices has provided an opportunity for fiscal consolidation.",
        "In summary, even though the projections have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain.",
        "In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months.",
        "Counter-factual exercises suggest that with headline inflation at 12-month horizon above the target (at 4.2% in Q2 of 201920), a change in the stance at this stage, especially with heightened oil price volatility, would be premature.",
        "In other words, while the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether.",
        "Turning to growth, the outlook remains overall healthy, though there are some signs of emerging downside risks.",
        "On the positive front, investment has picked up and should be buoyed further by improving capacity utilisation.",
        "Composite PMI stands at its highest level in 24 months.",
        "Coincident and leading indicators, such as aggregate bank credit, are increasing above the nominal GDP growth rate.",
        "Oil price and external sector pressures have reduced which should ease financing conditions.",
        "On the negative front, there are some segments experiencing slowdown such as auto sales, but at least a part of this appears, in our research, to be linked to fuel price rise of past six months and regulatory revisions in mandatory third-party insurance expectation but the Q1 print was far above.",
        "Overall, due to change in macroeconomic conditions, the two-sided growth surprises have not led to revision in our growth forecast for next 12 months.",
        "On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch, i.e., remain data-dependent as well as reliant on clear understanding of the drivers of recent data.",
        "I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold and maintaining the stance of monetary policy as calibrated tightening.",
        "Headline inflation moderated significantly to 3.3 per cent in October from 3.7 per cent in August.",
        "Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees also softened to 3.1 per cent in October from 3.4 per cent in August 2018.",
        "Food inflation continued to surprise on the downside; widening of deflation in pulses, vegetables, and sugar, along with broad-based moderation in other food items moved the food group into deflation.",
        "Inflation in fuel remained elevated, reflecting a rise in international prices of liquefied petroleum gas and calibrated increase in domestic administered prices of kerosene.",
        "Inflation in items other than food and fuel rose sharply (to more than 6 per cent) on account of transport and communication, health, household goods and services and personal care and effects.",
        "On the whole, actual CPI inflation prints, especially in October, turned out to be markedly lower than the projections set out in the October policy.",
        "4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside.",
        "Adjusted for the HRA impact also, the above projections remain unchanged as the impact will fade away completely in December.",
        "Though inflation projections have been revised downwards, several uncertainties continue to cloud the outlook in the form of : (i) the risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices; (ii) continuing uncertainty about the exact impact of MSP on food inflation; (iii) uncertainty of the oil price trajectory; (iv) volatile financial markets; (v) elevated inflation expectations; (vi) the likely staggered impact of HRA revisions by state governments; the direct statistical impact of HRA will be looked through while being mindful of the second-round effects; and (vii) the risk of fiscal slippages at the centre and/or state levels.",
        "With the general government (centre plus states) fiscal deficit budgeted at about 6 per cent of GDP in 64.",
        "Gross domestic product (GDP) growth decelerated to 7.1 per cent in Q2:2018 19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, driven mainly by a slowdown in private consumption.",
        "A sharper growth of imports relative to exports resulted in net exports pulling down aggregate demand.",
        "However, gross fixed capital formation expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter.",
        "On the supply side, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms.",
        "Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also augurs well for investment activity, especially because bank credit growth has continued to accelerate.",
        "Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 has been H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside.",
        "All things considered, the time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals; fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity.",
        "Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices.",
        "Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints.",
        "Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as basis in the coming months, there is possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course."

        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, feedback from industry associations and the projections of quarterly projection model.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Global growth has been slowing more than anticipated through 2016 so far, with weak investment and trade damping aggregate demand.",
        "Meanwhile, risks in the form of Brexit, banking stress in Europe, rebalancing of debt-fuelled growth in China, rising protectionism and diminishing confidence in monetary policy have slanted the outlook to the downside.",
        "World trade volume has contracted sharper than expected in the first half of 2016, and the outlook has worsened with the recent falling off of imports by advanced economies (AEs) from emerging market economies (EMEs).",
        "Inflation remains subdued in AEs and has started to edge down in EMEs.",
        "9. International financial markets were overwhelmed by the Brexit vote in Q2, with equity markets losing valuations worldwide, currencies plunging and turning volatile, and investors rushing for safe havens.",
        "Markets, however, recovered quickly and reclaimed lost ground in Q3, with a return of risk appetite propelling capital flows back into EMEs.",
        "Nonetheless, an uneasy calm prevails on uncertainty about the stance of monetary policy of systemic central banks.",
        "Commodity prices have firmed up slightly, easing stress for commodity exporters and shaving off some of the terms of trade gains accruing to commodity importers.",
        "Crude prices rose to a recent peak in Q2 of 2016, mostly on supply disruption in various parts of the world, and again in late September as the OPEC announced intentions of cutting back on supply; but, the upturn has been curbed by higher inventories.",
        "On the domestic front, the outlook for agricultural activity has brightened considerably.",

        "Even after trimming the statistical effects of the lumpy and orderdriven contraction of insulated rubber cables, industrial production as measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) turned out to be slower than a year ago.",
        "In August, steel production rose to a 37-month high and cement production maintained momentum - auguring well for construction activity - even though the output of core industries as a whole was weighed down by a decline in the production of coal, crude oil and natural gas and deceleration in refinery products and electricity generation.",

        "An increasing number of high frequency indicators are moving into positive territory, construction is boosted by policy initiatives, and public administration, defence and other services will be supported by the pay commission award.",
        "Retail inflation measured by the headline CPI had been elevated by a sharp pick-up in the momentum of food inflation overwhelming favourable base effects during April-July.",
        "In August, however, the momentum of food inflation turned negative and surprised expectations; consequently, base effects in that month came into full play and pulled down headline inflation to an intra-year low.",
        "Fuel inflation has moderated steadily through the year so far.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel (including petrol and diesel embedded in transportation) has been sticky around 5 per cent, mainly in respect to education, medical and personal care services.",
        "Households reacted to the recent hardening of food inflation adaptively and raised their inflation expectations survey of households.",
        "Input costs in the manufacturing sector, including staff costs, have firmed up slightly as evident in various surveys, but the presence of considerable slack has restrained their transmission into corporate pricing power.",

        "Liquidity was injected through open market purchases of ` 200 billion rate (WACR) remained tightly aligned with the policy repo rate and, in fact, traded with a soft bias.",
        "Interest rates on commercial paper (CPs) and certificates of deposit (CD) also eased.",
        "In the external sector, merchandise exports contracted in the first two months of Q2.",
        "Subdued domestic demand was, however, reflected in a faster contraction in imports.",
        "Moreover, the still soft crude prices pared off a fifth of the oil import bill and gold import volume slumped to a fifth of its volume a year ago.",
        "Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by US$ 10 billion in April-August on a year-onyear basis.",
        "These developments are likely to have contained the current account deficit in Q2 at its level in Q1, although the decline in remittances and the flattening of software earnings warrants monitoring.",
        "While the pace of foreign direct investment slowed compared to a year ago, portfolio flows were stronger after the Brexit vote, galvanised by a search for returns in an expanding universe of negative yields.",
        "The an all-time high.",
        "The Committee expects that the strong improvement in sowing, along with supply management measures, will improve the food inflation outlook.",
        "It notes that the sharp drop in inflation reflects a downward shift in the momentum of food inflation effects of a favourable base effect.",
        "The Government has announced several measures to cool food inflation pressures, especially with regard to pulses.",
        "These measures should help in moderating the momentum of food inflation in the months ahead.",
        "This has opened up space for policy action, as indicated in the third bimonthly monetary policy statement.",
        "The easy liquidity conditions engendered by the action through various market segments.",
        "Furthermore, banks should find added impetus for better transmission by the recent downward adjustment in small savings rates.",
        "The Committee took note of potential cost push pressures that may emerge, including the 7[th] pay commission award on house rent allowances, and the increase in minimum wages with possible spillovers through minimum support prices.",
        "The fuller play of these factors will need vigilance to prevent a generalised cost spiral from taking root.",
        "On balance, the Committee envisages a trajectory taking headline CPI inflation towards a central tendency of 5 per cent by March 2017, with risks tilted to the upside _albeit lower than in the second and third bi-monthly monetary policy_ statements of June and August respectively (Chart 1).",
        "The momentum of growth is expected to quicken with a normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to the urban stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should support a revival of credit to the productive sectors.",
        "The continuing sluggishness in world trade and smaller terms of trade gains than in the past point, however, to further slackening of external demand going forward.",
        "Accordingly, the projection of growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2).",
        "Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision.",
        "The minutes of MPC is scheduled on December 6 and 7, 2016 and its resolution will be announced 17.",
        "In view of a good monsoon, a decline in food inflation and better food supply management by the government, there has been some abatement of both cyclical and structural risks to the March 2017 consumer price index (CPI) inflation target.",
        "With persistent slack in the economy evidenced by unutilised capacity over the past few years, corporate pricing power remains weak.",
        "The persistence of core inflation remains a concern.",
        "While I recognise that upside risks to meeting the objective of 5 per cent CPI inflation by Q4 of 2016-17 remain, given the current juncture, these are acceptable risks.",
        "Expectations of future inflation at the monetary policy horizon, as evidenced by the survey of professional forecasters, are closer to the inflation target, which is also expected to contribute to low and stable inflation.",
        "On growth, there are signs of revival of economic activity, which needs to be nurtured.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a 25 basis points (bps) cut Monetary Policy Committee.",
        "The modest softening of inflation and inflation expectations seen in some of the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank, along with lacklustre private investment spending and unused capacity, provides a window for a reduction in the policy rate.",
        "inflation expectations, the Consumer Confidence Survey presents an encouraging outlook for the price situation as well as future economic conditions.",
        "Further, while the manufacturing sector in the short-run, this is not expected to transmit to higher selling prices.",
        "On the other hand, input cost expectations are muted in the infrastructure sector.",
        "Additionally, the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggests anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "In this backdrop, I feel that it is a good time to support growth by reducing the policy rate.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy repo rate from 24.",
        "Some of the upside risks to inflation discussed in the MPC meeting on October 3 and 4, 2016, particularly arising out of the award of the 7[th] Pay Commission, are largely statistical according to me.",
        "Looking forward, in my opinion, the probability of inflation turning up from the current level is reasonably less.",
        "On the other hand, there are good chances for the consumer inflation to soften further substantially, benefiting from a good monsoon, supply management measures of the Government and ongoing reforms gaining traction in terms of reducing costs and improving output response.",
        "As far as the growth outlook is concerned, I hold the view that the potential growth path of the Indian economy is gradually moving up, particularly in response to several reform measures implemented by the Government.",
        "Since there is substantial under-utilisation of capacity in the system, I do not see major risk to inflation if the output gap closes fast.",
        "The above assessment gives me the comfort to vote in favour of a cut in the repo rate by 25 basis points.",
        "I vote for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and I fully endorse the rationale for the decision set out in the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement.",
        "Several parts of the economy are languishing, but as the statement points out, railways and inland waterways; some categories of services; transmission of policy impulses through financial markets stimulated by ample liquidity; foreign portfolio important among these positives is the improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "In a framework in which inflation forecasts congeal all available information and serve as the intermediate target of monetary policy, two aspects are noteworthy: (a) the level of the inflation forecast for Q4 of 2016-17 is closer to the target than before; and (b) it has been moving down in relation to the second and third bi-monthly statement there is a turn in its momentum that is exploitable, especially by measures that hold down month-on-month changes in prices of essential food items.",
        "Moreover, the which allowed the play of base effects.",
        "If the beneficial effects of the satisfactory monsoon keep momentum muted and take inflation below the projection for Q3, the target for Q4 should be achievable.",
        "Therefore, while staying focused on the path of disinflation set out in previous monetary policy statements, it is, in my view, most timely now to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points and drive the actualisation of of inflation converging to its target and the economy poised on the threshold of an acceleration of growth in the next three quarters of the year.",
        "It is crucial, however, to step up vigil around the upturn in inflation projected in the last quarter of 2016-17 to guard against any risk to the target.",
        "I agree with the assessment of risks to growth and inflation presented in the MPC resolution and vote in favour of lowering the policy repo rate by 25 basis points because of the following specific reasons.",
        "increased, particularly through the trade channel, risks to inflation from global factors may be easing, going by the observed high intensity and spread of global disinflation.",
        "From amongst the domestic sources of risks to inflation, I see the maximum comfort coming from pulses.",
        "The first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains point to pulses production rising by 57 per cent this year.",
        "Despite two consecutive years of droughts, food inflation could be contained because of effective supply management measures by the Government.",
        "With a normal monsoon this year, I expect food inflation to stay even more firmly contained.",
        "Given the high weight of food in the CPI basket, supply response and supply management will remain critically important to influence the space for monetary policy actions.",
        "On the growth front, while the pace is expected to gain gradual momentum, the private investment cycle remains depressed and is yet to respond adequately to the improving consumption demand.",
        "Recent data on production of capital goods, imports of capital goods and flow of credit to industry indicate the weak state of investment demand.",
        "In this environment, a rate cut according to me will help in stimulating investment demand while also easing somewhat the pressure on firms stemming from balance sheet repairs.",
        "Indicators of economic activity pointed to a subdued outlook, though gradually improving; further, continuing low capacity utilisation in industry and the persistence of the output gap suggested that pricing power is likely to remain low.",
        "Importantly, high frequency data embedded in our forward-looking surveys as well as daily movements in prices of fruits and vegetables, cereals and even pulses across the country gave us some confidence that the inflation target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 can be achieved.",
        "Therefore, while our model-based projections indicated upside risks to the target, a calibrated policy judgement was warranted, given that some space for policy action had opened up with the fall in inflation in the August reading.",
        "Nonetheless, inflation outcomes in Q4 will have to be carefully and continuously monitored as upside risks, albeit lower now than before, persist.",
        "The second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on December 6 and 7, 2016 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.",
        "The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Shri R. Gandhi, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor.",
        "According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on resolutions adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting.",
        "The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters.",
        "The Committee around various risks to the outlook.",
        "Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below.",
        "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: - keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent.",
        "Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent.",
        "The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.",
        "The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.",
        "Global growth picked up modestly in the second half of 2016, after weakening in the first half.",
        "Activity in advanced economies (AEs) improved hesitantly, led by a rebound in the US.",
        "In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has moderated, but policy stimulus in China and some easing of stress in the larger commodity exporters shored up momentum.",
        "World trade is beginning to emerge out of a trough that bottomed out in July-August and shows signs of stabilising.",
        "Inflation has ticked up in some AEs, though well below target, and is easing in several EMEs.",
        "Expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US, Japan and China, and the waning of downward pressures on EMEs in recession are tempered by still-prevalent political risks in the euro area and the UK, emerging geo-political risks and the spectre of financial market volatility.",
        "9. International financial markets were strongly impacted by the result of the US presidential election and incoming data that raised the probability of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy.",
        "As bouts of volatility fuelled a risk-off surge into US equities and out of fixed income markets, a risk-on stampede pulled out capital flows from EMEs, plunging their currencies and equity markets to recent lows even as bond yields hardened in tandem with US yields.",
        "The surge of the US dollar from late October intensified after the election results and triggered sizable depreciations in currencies around the world.",
        "Commodity prices firmed up across the board from mid-November on an improvement in the outlook for demand following the US election results, barring gold which lost its safe haven glitter to the ascendant US 10.",
        "On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) in Q2 of 2016-17 turned out to be lower than projected on account of a deeper than expected slowdown in industrial activity.",
        "Manufacturing slowed down both sequentially and on an annual basis, with weak demand conditions and the firming up of input costs dragging down the profitability of corporations.",
        "Gross fixed capital formation contracted for the third consecutive quarter.",
        "Although government final consumption expenditure slowed sequentially, it supported private final consumption expenditure, the mainstay of aggregate demand.",
        "The contribution of net exports to aggregate demand remained positive, but on account of a sharper contraction in imports relative to exports.",
        "Turning to Q3, the Committee felt that the assessment is clouded by the still unfolding effects of the withdrawal of specified bank notes (SBNs).",
        "The steady expansion in acreage under rabi sowing across major crops compared to a year ago should build on the robust performance of agriculture in Q2.",
        "By contrast, industrial activity remains weak.",
        "Among the core industries in the index of industrial production (IIP), the output of coal contracted in October due to subdued demand, while the production of crude oil and natural gas shrank under the binding constraint of structural impediments.",
        "The production of cement, fertilisers and electricity continued to decelerate, reflecting the sluggishness in underlying economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties.",
        "Refinery output accelerated on the back of a pick-up in exports and capacity additions.",
        "The withdrawal of SBNs could transiently interrupt some part of industrial activity in November-December due to delays in payments of wages and purchases of inputs, although a fuller assessment is awaited.",
        "In the services sector, the outlook is mixed with construction, trade, transport, hotels and communication impacted by temporary SBN effects, while public administration, defence and other services would continue to be buoyed by the 7[th] Central Pay Commission (CPC) award and one rank one pension (OROP).",
        "GVA by financial services is expected to receive a short-term boost from the large inflow of low-cost deposits.",
        "Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) eased more than expected for the third consecutive month in October, driven down by a sharper than anticipated deflation in the prices of vegetables.",
        "Underlying this softer reading, however, was an upturn in momentum as prices rose month-on-month across the board.",
        "Still elevated prices of sugar and protein-rich items, coupled with a turning up of prices of cereals, pulses and processed foods pushed up the momentum of food prices, which partly offset the moderation in food inflation brought about by a strong favourable base effect.",
        "In the fuel category, inflation eased with the decline in LPG prices on an annual basis and a fall in electricity prices from a month ago.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel continues to show strong persistence.",
        "Although housing and personal care inflation softened marginally, the steady rise in inflation in respect of education, medical and health services, and transport and communication has imparted stickiness to inflation in this category.",
        "Liquidity conditions have undergone large shifts in Q3 so far.",
        "Surplus conditions in October and early November were overwhelmed by the impact of the withdrawal of SBNs from November 9.",
        "Currency in circulation plunged by `7.4 trillion up to December 2; consequently, net of replacements, deposits surged into the banking system, leading to a massive increase in its excess reserves.",
        "The Reserve Bank scaled up its liquidity operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions of a wide range of tenors from overnight to 91 days, absorbing liquidity (net) of `5.2 trillion.",
        "The Reserve Bank allowed oil bonds issued by the Government as eligible securities under the LAF.",
        "From the fortnight beginning November 26, an incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied on the increase in net demand and time liabilities measure to drain excess liquidity from the system.",
        "From November 28, liquidity absorption fell back and the Reserve Bank undertook variable rate repo auctions of `3.3 trillion on November 28.",
        "As expected, money market conditions tightened thereafter and the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded near the upper bound of the LAF corridor on that day before dropping back to the policy repo rate on November 30.",
        "All other rates in the system firmed up in sympathy, with term premia getting restored gradually.",
        "Through this episode, active liquidity management prevented the WACR from falling even to the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the lower bound of the LAF corridor.",
        "Liquidity management was bolstered by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) from `0.3 trillion to `6 trillion on November 29.",
        "There have been three issuances of cash management bills and October.",
        "The return to positive territory was supported by a pick-up in both POL and non-POL exports.",
        "After a prolonged fall for 22 months, imports rose in October on the back of a sharp rise in the volume of gold imports and higher payments for POL imports.",
        "Non-oil non-gold import growth also turned positive after a gap of seven months.",
        "For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles.",
        "Net foreign direct investment has remained reasonably robust, with more than half going to manufacturing, communication and financial services.",
        "By contrast, portfolio investment outflows of the order of US $ 7.3 billion occurred in election and the near-certainty of monetary policy tightening in the US.",
        "The level of 15.",
        "The Committee took note of the upturn in the prices of several items that is masked by the easing of inflation on base effects during October.",
        "Despite some supply disruptions, the abrupt compression of demand in November due to the withdrawal of SBNs could push down the prices of perishables in the reading that becomes available in December.",
        "On the other hand, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up.",
        "While discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of these items may weather these transitory effects as they are normally revised according to pre-set cycles.",
        "Prices of housing, fuel and light, health, transport and communication, pan, tobacco reverse and turn unfavourable in December and February.",
        "If the usual winter moderation in food prices does not materialise due to the disruptions, food inflation pressures could re-emerge.",
        "Furthermore, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been resistant to downward impulses and could set a floor to headline inflation.",
        "Global developments, especially as financial markets factor in the future stance of US monetary and fiscal policy, could impart volatility to the exchange rate thereby feeding into inflation.",
        "The withdrawal of SBNs could result in a possible factors into account, headline inflation is projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks tilted to the upside but lower than in the October policy review.",
        "The fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7[th] CPC award are yet to be assessed, pending implementation, and have not been reckoned in this baseline inflation path 16.",
        "The outlook for GVA growth for 2016-17 has turned uncertain after the unexpected loss of momentum by 50 basis points in Q2 and the effects of the withdrawal of SBNs which are still playing out.",
        "Downside risks in the near term could travel through two major channels: (a) short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade hotels & restaurants and transportation and in the unorganised sector; (b) aggregate demand compression associated with adverse wealth effects.",
        "The impact of the first channel should, however, ebb with the progressive increase in the circulation of new currency notes and greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy, while the impact of the second channel is likely to be limited.",
        "In October 2016, GVA growth in H2 was projected at 7.7 per cent and for the full year at 7.6 per cent.",
        "Incorporating the expected loss of growth momentum in Q3 and waning effects in Q4 alongside the boost to consumption demand from higher agricultural output and the implementation of the 7[th] CPC award, GVA growth for 2016-17 is revised down from 7.6 per cent to 7.1 per 17.",
        "The liquidity management framework was refined in April with the objective of meeting short-term liquidity needs through regular facilities, frictional and seasonal mismatches through fine-tuning operations and more durable liquidity needs for facilitating growth by modulating net foreign assets and net domestic assets.",
        "The Reserve Bank has conducted liquidity management consistent with this framework, progressively moving the system level _ex ante liquidity conditions to close to_ neutrality.",
        "In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode.",
        "The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of `1.1 trillion through OMO purchases during the fiscal year so far, including an OMO purchase auction of `100 billion in October.",
        "Although the replacement of SBNs has engendered large surplus liquidity warranting exceptional operations, this needs to be seen as transitory.",
        "The Reserve Bank is committed to conducting liquidity operations in pursuit of the objectives of the revised framework put in place in April to restore system level liquidity to a position of neutrality as the surplus liquidity pressures abate.",
        "In the view of the Committee, this bi-monthly review is set against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty.",
        "Globally, the imminent tightening of monetary policy in the US is triggering bouts of high volatility in financial markets, with the possibility of large spillovers that could have macroeconomic implications for EMEs.",
        "In India, while supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyse more information and experience influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance.",
        "If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly.",
        "Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum.",
        "Another disconcerting feature of recent developments is the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel which could set a resistance level for future downward movements in the headline.",
        "Moreover, volatility in crude prices and the surge in financial market turbulence could put the inflation target for Q4 of 2016-17 at some risk.",
        "Given these indicators of underlying inflation, it is appropriate to look through the transitory but unclear effects of the withdrawal of SBNs while setting the monetary policy stance.",
        "On balance, therefore, it is prudent to wait and watch how these factors play out and impinge upon the outlook.",
        "Accordingly, the policy repo rate has been kept on hold in this review, while retaining an accommodative policy stance.",
        "Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision.",
        "The minutes of MPC is scheduled on February 7 & 8, 2017 and its resolution will be placed on the 20.",
        "Because of the increased uncertainty due to the withdrawal of SBNs, and 21.",
        "While a negative demand shock because of the withdrawal of SBNs will lead to a decline in consumption demand, the risks that such a reduction will have longer term effects by impinging on overall investment sentiment and investment activity are low.",
        "The risks that weakening aggregate demand could exacerbate a current type of profits, leading to credit restrictions which further weaken the real economy, are also low.",
        "What counters the adverse effects of the withdrawal of SBNs is the aggressive pace of digitisation, and the fast restoration of the transaction demand for money from the re-tendering process.",
        "I therefore expect the demand and supply effects from the withdrawal of SBNs to be transient with the accompanying increase in the output gap likely to be temporary.",
        "This makes it inappropriate to respond with a rate cut.",
        "My paramount concern at this juncture has to do with the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "While headline inflation declined in October, inflation excluding food and fuel increased to 4.9 per cent in October, and remains sticky despite favourable base effects.",
        "It may be that a decline in core only comes after there is a substantial decline in inflationary expectations.",
        "Since the last review, there has also been a reversal of the non-food commodity cycle (e.g., metals, oil).",
        "Having said this, food inflation declined sharply in October although cereal inflation has been increasing gradually, and pulses and products continue to be major contributors of food inflation While cereal prices may be constrained by buffer stocks vegetable inflation is transient in nature, with possible reversals in trend.",
        "What is comforting though is that fewer commodities are driving inflation now compared to last month, which means that inflation is less generalised.",
        "Some disinflation will also come about because of the withdrawal of SBNs, although with a lag.",
        "Despite a 175 basis points cut in the policy rate between January 2015 and November 2016, the reduction in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on outstanding rupee loans for data up to September 2016 was only 71 basis points.",
        "Because of imperfect interest-rate pass through so far, an additional cut at this juncture may not yield any further transmission from banks.",
        "Once the union budget is announced in the first week of February, there will be one more data point.",
        "Taking into account these considerations, I vote for keeping the policy repo Committee.",
        "I also believe that the Committee should now focus on the mid-point of the medium-term inflation target of 4 +/- 2 per cent given the lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "On the basis of the Indian leading indices produced by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), it can be inferred that the Indian economy was in a resilient state ahead of the decision to withdraw SBNs.",
        "It may be noted that a leading index predicts changes in economic activity and thus, cyclical turns in the economy.",
        "Specifically, with the Indian Leading Index growth in a clear cyclical upswing and rising to a two-year high before the withdrawal of SBNs, the economic growth outlook going into the autumn months had become increasingly optimistic, underscoring the perspective, at the time, the Indian economy was not vulnerable.",
        "Moreover, growth also in a decisive cyclical upturn.",
        "This indicates that improved exports growth may provide additional support to growth in economic activity, particularly in the context of this backdrop, the withdrawal of SBNs is expected to have only a transitory impact on economic activity.",
        "Moreover, with a cumulative reduction in the policy rate by 175 basis points since January 2015, conditions are conducive for further transmission to lending rates by banks.",
        "Meanwhile, in the light of higher international bond yields and a strong upturn in ECRI's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge (that anticipates U.S. inflation), the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise its policy rate this month.",
        "Keeping in view the above, I fully endorse the resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent.",
        "After carefully considering all arguments for and against holding the policy rate constant in the December review, I find the following reasons convincing for my vote: assessment of commodity groups in the CPI basket for the end of March 2017 is about 5 per cent with some upside risks.",
        "While my own point forecast based on a more aggregative econometric model is lower, the range estimates of the same indicate a significant chance of the inflation rate exceeding the threshold in March 2017 and in June 2017.",
        "Stickiness in the core inflation (other than food and fuel) at close to 5 per cent over the past several months is observed.",
        "This coupled with marginally declining but still very high inflationary expectations revealed by the RBI surveys need to be considered seriously.",
        "Given the recent developments on SBNs and related policies, the banking sector is likely to be flooded with liquidity for some time to come that on its own may exert a greater influence on the lending rates of banks than the repo rate.",
        "Transmission out of the cumulative reduction of 175 basis points in the repo rate since January 2015 has so far been substantially less than 50 per cent in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) for the outstanding Rupee loans and around 60 per cent in the WALR for the fresh rupee loans, whereas it is above 70 per cent in the deposit rates.",
        "Thus, there exists enough space for further transmission in the lending rates by the banks.",
        "Both external and domestic economic environments are currently impacted by some unique uncertainties as pointed out in the resolution of the Committee.",
        "The magnitude of individual and net impact is not very clear at this juncture.",
        "In such an environment characterised by uncertainties, any policy intervention in terms of repo rate with acknowledged longer outside lags is likely to add to the uncertainties, which will not be good for the economy.",
        "While the recent developments on SBNs can be considered as an exogenous shock to the economy that results in downward revision of the GDP growth forecast, it is widely perceived to be a transitory or temporary phenomenon.",
        "If it is so, it is not advisable to respond with a policy intervention that involves longer distributive lags, because otherwise it can destabilise the system or create avoidable uncertainty in policy stance and action in future.",
        "As the resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets out, an exceptional configuration of factors is obscuring a clear assessment of the outlook.",
        "While domestic supply disruptions and demand compression appear to be transient, global developments, including the morphing of political changes into macroeconomic risks, could likely be longer-lived and more challenging.",
        "Under these conditions, precaution warrants careful monitoring of the manner in which these forces play out and influence the near- to medium-term.",
        "In particular, it is critical to stay focused on the inflation target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 amidst subsiding but still-present upside risks in the form of firmness in prices of several food items barring vegetables, downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel.",
        "Achieving 5 per cent will imbue credibility into the commitment of monetary policy to the inflation target of 4 per cent, i.e., the centre of the target band.",
        "Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged, while allowing the transmission of policy rate reductions of 175 basis points effected from January 2015 to maintain accommodation in the monetary policy stance.",
        "I fully concur with the assessment set out in the monetary policy resolution of the MPC and vote in favour of no change in the repo rate because of the following reasons: 38.",
        "There is uncertainty about the short-term impact of the decision to withdraw significant downside risks to the medium-term growth prospects of the economy.",
        "However, there are other uncertainties as well, especially the oil price situation and geo-political situation.",
        "For a forward looking monetary policy framework, given the lags in monetary policy transmission, a policy rate action amidst heightened uncertainty will only implicitly allow short-term developments and expectations to impact the medium-term outlook, which needs to be avoided.",
        "In an environment characterised by uncertainty, it is more important to create or reinforce enabling conditions for monetary policy actions to work more effectively, going ahead.",
        "Hence, my vote for maintaining the policy rate at current level.",
        "Inflation excluding food and fuel remains sticky.",
        "International crude oil prices have firmed up.",
        "Global financial conditions pose a threat to macroeconomic and financial stability, with large fluctuations in capital flows and asset prices imparting volatility which gets transmitted into inflation.",
        "This uncertainty shows no sign of subsiding, and is likely to get accentuated in the coming year as US macroeconomic and trade policies realign.",
        "Even as growing credibility in the disinflation process in until December 2015, they remain elevated and feed into the services component of inflation.",
        "More recently, the steady easing of food inflation has brought about a decline in inflation expectations in the latest round of the survey.",
        "The impact of the withdrawal of SBNs on growth and inflation, while uncertain, is transitory.",
        "Against this backdrop, it is important for monetary policy to stay focused on the medium-term and strive to achieve, on a durable basis, the middle of the notified inflation target range i.e., 4 per cent.",
        "There are other risks to this objective.",
        "inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in 2017-19.",
        "Also, the implementation of the goods and services tax could produce a one-off step-up, _albeit modest, in_ inflation.",
        "The decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production, supported by key non-OPEC members, will harden crude prices further as demand and supply get balanced out.",
        "Recent movements in other commodity prices also suggest that the global commodity price cycle could be turning.",
        "Inflation in advanced economies is turning up incipiently and is expected to rise significantly in 2017 from 2016 levels.",
        "Achieving the inflation target of 5 per cent"
