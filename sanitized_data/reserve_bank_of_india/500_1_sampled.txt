Inflation, however, showed an uptick in meat and fish, and nonalcoholic beverages.
So, the advanced economies face a big inflation gap and a closed output gap, thus justifying aggressive tightening based on the central bank reaction functions.
Overall, monetary policy geared towards price stability while taking into account output dynamics is the best guarantee to ensure lasting prosperity.
The strong public investment in roads, railways and inland waterways, the recent efforts to unclog cash flows in large projects under arbitration, and the boost to spending from the 7[th] Pay the acceleration in the pace of activity in Q1 appears to have been sustained.
Thirdly, inflation excluding food and fuel remains persistently high.
We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22.
After the last meeting of MPC in June 2019, several important events have occurred.
Monetary policy has adopted an ultra-accommodative stance to revive growth and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.
Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum.
The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the amended Act); Shri R. Gandhi, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor.
Previous version available at: 5 While an IMF study in 2014 found causality from headline to core inflation, subsequent studies all find a reversal.
The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 5 and 6, 2017.
The effect of an increase in House Rent Allowance and the lingering impact of the goods and services tax (GST) also contributed towards the pressure on inflation.
The January 2022 update by IMF also projects the World trade volume - goods and services - to grow in 2022 at a lower rate than the previous October 2021 projections.
COVID-19 led to crash in demand as well as disrupted domestic supply chains.
The move towards an active disinflationary stance of monetary policy since the beginning of 2022-23 has helped to bring down inflation from its highly elevated levels, break the core inflation persistence and prevent inflation expectations from getting unanchored.
Administered prices of LPG and kerosene are set to rise with the calibrated reduction in subsidy.
In the process, spending will slow down, so will demand and so will the economy.
As pressures on oil prices persist, pump prices began rising steeply in end March.
On the domestic front, though inflation has moderated and plateaued since its recent peak of April 2022, it remains unacceptably and uncomfortably high.
Indicators such as E-way bills, GST collection and toll collection suggest sustained expansion in domestic economic activity.
It need not be a concern for the MPC.
While there is some comfort that inflation is forecast to be below the upper end of the tolerance band, it is important to emphasize that the inflation target for the MPC is 4% and not 6% or even 5%.
In fact, much of the policy rate action is yet to be transmitted to even the broader spectrum of interest rates.
The balance sheet of key stakeholders like corporates and banks remain strong.
Consumer confidence improved sequentially in Q2:2021-22 but remains gap down compared to normal levels pre-pandemic.
The overall inflation outlook is expected to be clouded by volatile and uncertain food prices and intermittent weather shocks.
Both the industrial outlook survey and the consumer confidence survey conducted by the RBI suggest that negative output gaps will remain in Q2 also.
The thirty first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from October 6 to 8, 2021.
Moreover, base effects will reverse and turn adverse during Q3 and Q4 of 2017-18.
The time to begin is upon us.
crude oil prices, US yields and US dollar, all of which were rising then.
Thus, to a large extent, the fiscal slippage of the Centre is compensated by the fiscal discipline shown by the States.
The number of central banks that have becoming visible.
investment plans for FY 2023-24.
With inflation projected to rise above 4 per cent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term.
Food inflation increased in June primarily due to an uptick in inflation in edible oils, pulses, eggs, milk and prepared meals and a pick-up in vegetable prices.
However, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions.
Since mid-June to end-July 2023 tomato prices have surged by 362 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of the price escalation happening during endJune and first half of July.
This inflation correction bears testimony to careful projections and judgment that by keeping policy accommodative, enabled avoiding what could have been a costly policy mistake.
Taking Indian repo rates too high imposed heavy costs in 2011, 2014 and 2018.
The inflation expectations survey of households shows a sharp 100 basis points fall in current household inflation perceptions between September and November.
The Reserve Bank remains committed to undertake pro-active conventional and unconventional measures and to effectively channelling the systemic liquidity to alleviate stress of critical sectors which have borne the brunt of the second wave.
The manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) remained in expansion in May although it moderated to 50.8 from 55.5 in April due to a slowdown in output and new orders.
As the path of disinflation needs to be sustained, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting.
The question that is uppermost is: Has the global recovery peaked prematurely, leaving behind the scars of the pandemic?
Despite recovery in 2021-22, real GDP is only marginally higher than the pre-pandemic level with private consumption still trailing its 2019-20 level.
Macroeconomic and financial stability is now well entrenched and needs to be nurtured and preserved with well calibrated and timely actions.
Hence, I vote for status quo in the policy rate and maintenance of the neutral stance.
The surge is a warning, however, to raise the level of care and precaution.
In many key EMEs, however, inflation has risen, though the recent retreat in energy prices, tightening of policy stances by central banks and stabilising of currencies may have a salutary impact, going forward.
I had earlier in my statements starting October 2020 stated that output gap will close towards the end of 2021-22.
The liquidity needs arising out of expansion in currency were met by the Reserve Bank through purchases under open market operations (OMOs).
Going forward, growth is likely to get some support from fiscal spending in the remaining months of this fiscal year when bulk of the on-budget stimulus is likely to be spent.
While the level of i t t h d t d i l l it i ll b l th pandemic trend line.
_Kharif_ sowing is progressing well thanks to the south-west monsoon.
This provides an overall context for an assessment of the likely course of growth and inflation in the short to medium term.
In view of the above arguments I vote for a 25 bps cut in the repo rate and a change in the stance to neutral.
It remains to be seen how it might respond ahead as pent-up demand wanes while animal spirits remain anaemic.
My reasons for this recommendation are the following: 38.
Dr. Ashima Goyal voted to increase the repo rate by 35 basis points.
Consequently, markets and analysts get increasingly certain that inflation may remain elevated through the greater part of 2022 and growth will slow further absent policy action to unclog supply bottlenecks.
The economy needs a larger push.
As per the latest available information, this risk has materialised with the uneven progress of the monsoon manifesting in the form of excess rains in the northwest regions and disrupting supply, and deficient rains in the eastern part delaying crop and the largest in recent memory.
Furthermore, there are clear signs of economic activity holding up well in Q1:2023-24[2] as indicated by various high frequency indicators and this optimism is expected to follow through in the remaining quarters of 2023-24.
The assessment by international agencies point to significant improvement in the global trade conditions in 2024 and the economic growth is expected to remain stable at the level of the previous year.
High-frequency indicators of the services sector suggest some moderation in the pace of activity.
Growth uncertainty has increased with the second wave in Covid-19 in some states.
On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties.
Spikes in food prices can therefore be looked through as long as they remain just that.
Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives.
There is still a chance CPI inflation may fall steeply in the next few months on supply-side action supported by favourable base effects.
Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent.
Across the developing world, food shortages will likely last through this year and the early part of next year, exacerbating the pain of soaring food prices.
This, combined with huge uncertainty about future demand, both domestic and external, is likely to hamper new will also be a challenge.
With the likely contraction in economic activity and the inflation outlook remaining soft, the policy space has opened up.
Apart from favourable base effects, the unlocking has picked speed and would significantly reduce supply chain bottlenecks causing both agriculture and non-agricultural prices to correct.
For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles.
Accordingly, I vote for status quo on both stance and rate in this policy.
Since then, the headline inflation prints have revealed further softening of inflation in January, followed by a pick-up in February.
In my statement for the last meeting (April 2024), I expressed concern about the growth sacrifice in 2024-25 induced by restrictive monetary policy.
Source of deeper contraction in GDP has been the lower net taxes on products as the GVA decline was lower at 6.5 per cent in the second advance estimates compared to 7.2 per cent in the First Advance Estimates.
On the other hand, deficient monsoon could have a more tangible impact on inflation due to the higher share of food items in the CPI consumption basket.
Investment activity, in particular, has accelerated.

Nevertheless, it is my considered view that the balance of risk and reward at the current juncture is still in favour of monetary accommodation.
Although it seems meaningful to compare progress with a pre-pandemic year, it needs to be noted that in 2019-20, a cyclical downturn had matured over 2 and a half years, taking down real GDP growth to its lowest in the 2011-12 based series of national accounts.
Considering all of above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged and maintaining accommodative stance as communicated in the resolution, that emphasises need for continued support to growth, while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space so as to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward.
The export growth in October-November 2021 has continued to support overall GDP growth.
Several other risks remain.
Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points.
The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in January 2024 provides estimated median forecast of headline inflation at 5.1% in Q4 2023-24 followed by 5.2%, 3.8%, and 4.9% in Q1 to Q3 2024-25, respectively.
While prospects for the rabi crop have improved, especially for wheat and oilseeds, risks from adverse weather events remain.
In the case of non-IT services firms, sales growth in Q3 is negative but less contractionary than Q2: 2020-21.
Wheat prices could see some correction on robust _mandi arrivals and_ procurement.
Upside risks associated with an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) still persist.
The outlook for agriculture is robust.
Steps have also been taken in the Union Budget to revive economic activity, with a focus on rural and infrastructure sectors.
The risk of ceding part of the operational range to the indifference range makes it imperative to emphasise the primacy of the 4 per cent inflation target.
I remain concerned about the impact of farm loan waivers on inflation and growth, due to induced departure from fiscal discipline, shift in the nature of state spending and the crowding out of private credit by further state borrowings from the market.
The domestic recovery is gaining traction, but activity is just about catching up with pre-pandemic levels and will have to be assiduously nurtured by conducive policy settings till it takes root and becomes self-sustaining.
The Indian economy is well-poised to achieve this combination and to reduce its chronic underemployment.
While the indicators such as non-food bank credit, GST collections and PMI for both manufacturing and services point to the continued momentum of domestic demand, the overall YOY growth in H2 of 2022-23 is expected to be lower compared to H1.
While the US and the Euro area registered record-setting contraction in output in Q2:2020, the emerging market economies (EMEs) also look set to see large declines in output.
With the abolition of the incremental cash reserve ratio from December 10, liquidity management operations have consisted of variable rate reverse repos under the LAF of tenors ranging from overnight to 91 days and auctions of cash management bills under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) of tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days.
Business and consumer confidence rose in October.
The Great Inflation episode after the oil price shock of 1973 bears testimony of these risks to which one needs to be mindful, even though recent flattening of Phillips curve has diminished correlation between core inflation and output.
Considering it appropriate to wait for growth signals to become solidly entrenched while remaining watchful on inflation dynamics, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.
In the construction segment, steel consumption was robust.
Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation eased further to 3.2 per cent in April, the lowest in the current CPI series, with core services inflation also falling to historic lows.
the services and infrastructure.
The core inflation[1 ]is projected at 4.9 per cent in Q2, followed by 4.7 per cent and 4.6 per cent in Q3 and Q4, respectively.
Since the advent of the pandemic, the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting, amounting to a total cut of 210 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020.
Primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum refinery products.
Hence, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and for continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation.
On balance, the need to support relaxing the supply side constraints is a priority as this is also needed to address inflation concerns.
Monetary policy is much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief to the worst affected segments of the economy.
Global trade continued to expand, underpinned by strong investment and robust manufacturing activity.
This has adversely impacted the outlook for crude oil prices.
Accordingly, I vote for increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points and for maintaining the stance of withdrawal of accommodation.
Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms.
All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.
Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.
iii) RBI survey has found that companies have started investing in financial assets rather than fixed assets.
Third concern relates to interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, which could intensify further, especially later into next year.
While a negative demand shock because of the withdrawal of SBNs will lead to a decline in consumption demand, the risks that such a reduction will have longer term effects by impinging on overall investment sentiment and investment activity are low.
Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a pause in the policy repo 32.
Various measures of underlying inflation are converging to the headline at above 5 per cent.
Bank credit growth has continued to improve.
One needs to wait for some more time to ascertain whether our unwinding of its asset purchase program; we might see a pick-up in imported inflation be entirely benign for inflation.
The ongoing trade tensions and the possible cooling of the housing market pose major risks to growth in China.
Taking into account double digit inflation in salient food categories such as cereals, pulses, spices and vegetables for several months, empirical evidence points to a rise in the time varying persistence of food inflation, i.e., it is taking longer to revert to its trend after a shock.
This enhanced guidance should strengthen and quicken the pace of transmission to longer-term yields and help support consumption and investment demand in the economy.
Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed down to 4.5 per cent Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), increased from 73.8 per cent in Q1 to 76.1 per cent in Q2, which was higher than the long-term average of 74.9 per cent; seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 76.4 per cent.
The decline in economic output is reflected in both production and expenditure accounts across most components.
This optimism regarding domestic and global economic growth is also reflected in the leading indexes compiled by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York.
The supply chains for the key food commodities were also exempted from transport restrictions, leading to sustenance of supply of these commodities.
Accordingly, continuity in the stance with a clear-cut objective of aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target is important.
The slippage during 2019-20 without additional resource mobilization (since it was an interim budget) also turns out to be less than 20 bps from the fiscal consolidation path.
In this regard, measures taken by the government and the RBI to encourage flow of credit to shadow banks are important confidence building steps.
Food (with a weight of around 46 per cent in overall CPI) contributed disproportionately at around 60 per cent to the surge in inflation.
While measures to address the local and domestic conditions related to both the economy and the pandemic have borne fruit, the global conditions appear diverse as far as the pandemic is concerned.
Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data.
Domestic air passenger traffic rose significantly in April.
Moreover, the fragile demand conditions could help limit the pass-through of input cost pressures across manufacturing and services to output prices.
Investment activity is push, and strengthening bank credit.
So it is important to ensure a sustained and sustainable revival this time.
The sequential gains in the manufacturing sector are strong with the PMI-Manufacturing in expansion zone for the past 8 months.
Global conditions affecting commodity prices are the other exogenous elements impacting the fuel prices and prices of other inputs.
Year on year growth in GST collection has maintained its strong growth and Non-food Bank Credit has maintained its higher pace of YOY growth since December 2021.
Moreover, imputed CPI excluding food and fuel inflation during April-May surged by 90-100 bps from March readings.
The imminent approvals for vaccines for the Covid-19 pandemic have raised the prospects of return to normal economic activities at the global level, subject of course to all the safety considerations until the vaccination programs cover all the population.
To align the inflation expectations with the policy target rate of inflation, further increase in policy rates is necessary at this juncture.
The level of foreign exchange reserves 19.
There are clearer signs of revival of investment activity.
Both the service and manufacturing PMIs continue to be in expansion mode for the last several months.
U.S., Eurozone and China, are in continued cyclical downswings, pointing to a further slowdown in global growth.
As growth regains solid ground, it could likely sustain inflation above the target.
The resurgence in inflation in May and June above the upper threshold has reignited the debate on the appropriate monetary policy response.
The recovery in economic activities requires support from consumer spending.
The Provisional Estimates brought out by National Statistics Office (NSO) for 2020-21 on May 31 now place the real GDP growth at -7.3 per cent over the previous year, a lower rate of contraction than provided in the Second Advance Estimates.
The potential for the spread of the virus in the absence of critically vital safety precautions such as masks and social distancing cannot be ignored until the effective vaccination is achieved.
The fortieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under 2022.
Overall Indian growth is resilient, but it is still below potential.
Merchandise exports declined by 1.1 per cent in October 2017 after showing positive growth for 14 consecutive months.
Since nonbank financial intermediaries do not have access to a lender of last resort and penalties for credit default are now high they also tend to hold excess liquidity.
The composite PMI output index 15.
that the size of the economy in 2021-22 will be moderately higher than 2019-20.
Crude oil prices jumped to 14year high in early March; despite some correction, they remain volatile at elevated levels.
Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent, with Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced.
Risks to inflation arise from price stickiness and supply chain disruptions, high costs of rebuilding or modifying supply chains and less than competitive markets under lockdowns, translating into higher retail margins.
Hence, more forceful tightening of monetary policy in 2023 may be required if terminal rates have to be achieved.
Finally, price adjustments to account for pandemic induced altered supply-side conditions may also emerge as the demand conditions improve.
Gold prices, which touched a two 1 From this resolution onwards, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will be used as the headline measure of economic activity.
Sustained growth in fixed capital formation may also require maintaining the pace of government capital outlay.
Although household inflation expectations are naive and much in excess of realized inflation, the direction of change is instructive.
The 3 month commercial paper rate is above 7%.
Capacity utilisation saw some improvement in Q2:2020-21 and a further pick-up is expected from Q3 onwards.
I vote for status quo i) Price quotations collected for various items from the designated shops by NSO to measure inflation could not be collected during April and May because of the nationwide lockdown.
Third, there is evidence of continuing generalisation of price pressures, especially in core.
Markets benefit from recovery and so are better able to absorb rate hikes that are in step with the latter.
I have consistently highlighted the risk that the persistence of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel poses to meeting the medium-term headline inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent.
Net exports dragged down aggregate demand in 2017-18 due to a surge in imports and deceleration in exports in Q3, the latter being driven in part by GST-related working capital disruptions.
The industrial sector, by contrast, suffered a manufacturingdriven contraction in early fiscal year Q2, after a sequential deceleration in gross value added in Q1.
Rural wage growth is flat at 4.8 per cent.
In my view, these healthy developments on the economic activity front are likely to remain durable due to steady progress in the time-bound resolution of twin balance-sheet problem affecting our banks and corporates.
The recent data suggests that the incidence of new infections has declined.
I want to thank the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India for giving me this opportunity.
Imports of capital continued in contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings.
The monthly headline CPI inflation prints of January and February 2019 have continued to undershoot the RBI projections substantially, forcing the RBI for further downward revision of headline inflation from 2.8 to 2.4 percent for Q4:FY 2018-19.
Urban consumption continues to be steady.
Imports of coal, electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, vegetable oils and machinery also accelerated.
The minutes of 30.
The key challenge for monetary policy at this stage is to resuscitate domestic demand to avoid any harmful effect on income and employment in the short run and potential growth over the medium term.
I also worry that India is not consolidating fiscally although the extra budgetary spending on social welfare and stimulative programs may not materialize (unless states match it with their own initiatives).
Should an inflation-targeting central bank react to a narrowing output gap in such a scenario?
Much of what I wrote in my December statement remains valid now as well.
Inflation expectations also remain elevated.
I therefore vote to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The arguments made in my last statement are still valid.
Available data for Q3:2021-22 indicate that the momentum of economic activity is gaining further traction, aided by expanding vaccination coverage, the rapid subsiding of new improved in October over the same month of 2019 (pre-pandemic level), while motorcycle sales are slowly inching towards their pre-pandemic levels.
The only source of comfort is that all the evidence at the moment suggests that inflation is being driven not by domestic demand, but by supply side factors including the global surge in commodity prices.
At present only small steps are required to align the repo with the fall in inflation so this should not be seen as the start of a rate cut cycle.
Otherwise also, consumer confidence has been dented and consumers are likely to cut down on discretionary spending.
It is important, therefore, while remaining pre-emptive and forward looking, to wait for data on actual outcomes, watching for first signs of second round pass through in inflation as well as for alleviation on the supply-side.
An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures.
Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent.
Through the current episode, inflation has declined from an average of 7.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2022-23 (peak at 7.8 per cent in April 2022) to 4.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2023-24 (4.8 per cent in June 2023), i.e., by 270 basis points.

The Covid 19 pandemic is seen to be coming under control combined with fiscal stimulus measures to revive demand.
Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs, supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures.
Maintaining the growth momentum of consumption demand.
Even as the domestic economy is showing signs of mending, the external environment is turning more uncertain and challenging, with headwinds from slowing growth in some major Asian and advanced economies, steep jump in natural gas prices in the recent weeks and concerns emanating from normalisation of monetary policy in some major advanced economies.
At a broad level, output levels of the various sectors in Q2FY22 measured by GVA at constant prices are above Q2FY21.
Instead, reasonable conclusion is that vegetable prices continue to show seasonality over years, something amenable to monetary policy actions, and certainly not at short horizon of a few months at which it is likely to, and typically does, revert.
Some moderation in the rate of increase in prices of 14.
Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.
Also, the reverse migration of labour to villages has been muted relative to last year and inter-state movement of goods continues smoothly.
Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have continued unabated, posing challenges for monetary policy.
High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March.
If the pace of this recovery is slower on the supply side, prices would rise if demand grows more quickly.
However, demand will take time to li d k i t i t th t I th i t corporate pricing power is unlikely to recover, though upside risks to inflation remain from possible collusive behaviour in less competitive industries, as also further unforeseen supply disruptions in food.
Research finds inflation to be more in Covid-19 affected products.
In keeping with this stance, the policy rate has been reduced by 75 basis points since February 2020 when the virus outbreak assumed pandemic proportions.

A key factor influencing the private investment in the manufacturing sectors appears to be the level of capacity utilisation, which is still below the long-term average reflecting both demand and supply constraints.
activity, has eased in recent months.
Consumers remain optimistic about the outlook, and business sentiment of manufacturing firms is gradually improving.
Further, a potential increase in financial market volatility due to global developments, including the unwinding of the balance sheet by the Fed and the possibility of normalisation by the ECB, are also major concerns.
Effective supply management by the government, as in the recent past, could help in keeping food inflation under check.
The available data on a wide range of indicators of output and demand conditions for January and February point to an on-going recovery.
The OECD points out that seasonally adjusted Indian quarter on quarter growth was the lowest after China and Poland.
Coupled with expectations of fiscal expansion in the US, this has propelled the US dollar to a multi-year high.
CPI inflation excluding vegetables has moved higher.
The optimism generated by these evolving macroeconomic conditions and the recent improvement in financial conditions in response to prudent and growth-stimulating budgetary announcements would come full circle if inflation eases and aligns with the target.
One cannot reject the hypothesis that the recent slowdown in the real GDP growth in India is on account of high real policy rates among other factors.
GDP numbers for Q2:2019 in respect of some major advanced and emerging market economies have been subdued.
Economic recovery is likely to ensue.
Global risks are rising with the Omicron variant as well as with expectations of an earlier Fed taper.
This is consistent with inflation cycle downturn that began in mid-2018 is poised to persist.
On the output front, GDP growth slowed down significantly in the first quarter of 2017-18, reflecting slower agricultural and manufacturing growth, along with tepid consumption and investment demand.
First, aggregate bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based.
The southwest monsoon has picked up and is progressing well.
Oil has a much faster supply response now because of shale oil as well as green substitutes, capping future rise in prices.
In other words, the assumption of particularly benign food inflation in the short run imparts significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, at the short- and/or medium-term horizons, from the fiscal adjustments that would be necessary to address resulting agrarian distress and to boost rural demand.
Let me now briefly sum up how growth and inflation scenarios might unfold and my view on the decisions at hand.
But this is likely to be temporary, although uncertainty remains about the timeline.
It is the MPC, whose mandate covers all interests, respond to pressing priorities and seize opportunities.
All this, after a period of four years of uninterrupted success in keeping inflation well within the tolerance band and in fact, closely aligned with the target, which has earned the country credibility in monetary policy conduct, investor confidence and the anchoring of expectations!
Policy has to tighten against negative supply shocks as well as against positive demand shocks that raise the equilibrium rate.
Capital flows to EMEs have continued, but appear increasingly vulnerable to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed.
Investment demand is lagging consumption demand but has started to look up.
In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode.
In the Euro area too, GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions.
Rural demand is gradually improving while urban demand remains ebullient.
This was largely driven by domestic demand, especially investment activity.
However, under prevailing circumstances, the immediate transmission should be considered not so much in terms of the bank deposit and lending rates but more specific rates influencing new investments such as housing loans, vehicle loans and long term bonds.
Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation (excluding food and fuel), although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook.
On the services side, the picture remained mixed.

Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST.
More than half of this divergence is due to a combination of retailer margins in food prices (amplified by its higher weight in CPI than in the WPI), the sharp increase in taxes on petroleum products and alcoholic beverages in the post-COVID period (which are not captured in the WPI), and high prices of non-traded services such as healthcare, transport and personal services.

upward adjustments of domestic POL prices in response to the hardening of international crude prices, including catching up with withheld pass-through; imminent MSP increases; fiscal slippage; customs duty increases.
First, disentangling recent disinflation in terms of relative roles of structural and transitory drivers remains a challenge.
Secondly, market indicators of uncertainty in international crude oil prices remain high, reflecting the unexpectedly large gyrations in their movement this year and upcoming geo-political risks such as OPEC supply decision and trade war markets was around 25% per annum (p.a.)
Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 1).
It appears to me that the steep yield curve reflects a lack of credibility of the MPC resolution is an attempt to solve this problem, and my only difficulty with this commitment of the MPC to respond aggressively to inflation shocks that lie well above the upper band of the fan chart (Chart 1 of the Monetary Policy Statement).
Adverse source of upside risk to food prices.
Small steps over a prolonged period could allow inflation to get entrenched and inflation expectations unhinged.

This rise has been broad-based, consistent with the durability of a growth pick-up over this period, and also confirmed by input price pressures and selling price increases - The inflation trajectory over the entire twelve-month period is projected, despite the soft print in February, to remain above the MPC target rate of 4 per cent, on a quarter by quarter basis.
When headline inflation faces price pressures from perishables like vegetables, the standard operating procedure of monetary policy is to look through the transitory impact of their first round effects and await mean reversion.
Moreover, the deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have been in operation since Q2.
performance in Q3 of 2018 19 was stable; capacity utilisation absolute or seasonally adjusted has remained robust and close to or above 75 for past two quarters; PMI manufacturing and services continue to remain in expansion mode at healthy levels; and consumer sentiment surveyed by the RBI has improved.
On balance, I remain concerned about (i) the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel; (ii) upward risks that could emanate from oil prices and fiscal implications of sustained food deflation; and, (iii) lack of adequate and sustained downward adjustment in household inflation expectations over the past 12 months.

Household expectations of income, spending and employment appear to have weakened, but may be anchored to the past few months and need to be tracked in the coming months.
Rebalancing of liquidity began early.
With both inflation and growth outcomes being well within the range of expectations of the MPC, and short term interest rates being within the corridor defined by the repo and reverse repo rate, there is nothing to be done and there is nothing to be said as of now.

On the other hand, there is increasing evidence of inflation becoming persistent in the upper region of the tolerance band, though it is projected to remain within the band.
States have now started forming a larger proportion of the public expenditures and having a clear idea on their fiscal deficits is important for the monetary policy.
