Furthermore, the MPC decided to reduce the deposit rate from 9.5% to 9% and the lending rate from 12.5% to 11.5%.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core were largely driven by favorable movements in food prices while non‐food prices remained broadly tame.
Annual headline urban inflation recorded 7.1 percent in December 2019 compared to 3.6 percent in November 2019, as monthly inflation recorded negative 0.2 percent in December 2019 compared to negative 3.4 percent in December 2018.
The quarter ending June 2014 has witnessed a notable slowdown in the prices of several food items which have been reflected in the tame monthly growth rates of both headline and core inflation.
Headline and core annual inflation rates thereby registered the lowest rates since October 2016 and September 2016, respectively.
Annual headline urban inflation declined to 4.7 percent in May 2020 from 5.9 percent in April 2020, supported by muted inflationary pressures as well as favorable base effects where monthly headline inflation recorded zero in May 2020 compared to 1.1 percent in May 2019.
Given the clear evidence of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC judges that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and today’s decision is aimed at containing inflation expectations.
Concurrently, there were additional price pressures from the ongoing strong economic growth.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 5.7 percent in August 2021 from 5.4 percent in July 2021, after having accelerated from 4.9 percent in June 2021.
Meanwhile, real GDP jumped significantly in 2014/15 Q1, registering at 6.8 percent the highest annual growth rate since 2007/08 Q4.
Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term supports real incomes and sustains the achieved competitive gains of the Egyptian economy.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decelerate, recording 33.7 percent and 34.2 percent in December 2023, respectively, due to favourable base effects.
In account of the above, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged at this juncture remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
Moreover, the money and foreign exchange markets have been operating in an orderly manner and remain very liquid.
The MPC has witnessed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in manufacturing and real estate sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price hike.
The committee will continue to judge the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook with the aim of achieving price stability over the medium term.
On the other hand, core CPI accelerated by 2.82 percent in August leading to a jump in the annual rate to 8.16 percent with more than fifty percent driven by the prices of red meat and poultry.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined to 6.5 percent in Q2 2024 compared to 6.7 percent in Q1 2024, mainly driven by robust employment in the agriculture sector.
In its meeting held on March 26, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates by 50 bps to 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on domestic investment and external demand.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained low.
Annual headline urban inflation recorded 7.2 percent in January 2020 compared to 7.1 percent in December 2019, as monthly inflation recorded 0.7 percent in January 2020 compared to 0.6 percent in January 2019.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 8.75 percent per annum.
Nonetheless, GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing sector.
A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in H1 2025 due to the combined impact of recent monetary policy tightening, unification of the foreign exchange market, and favorable base effects.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 5.9 percent in 2009/10 Q4 compared to the four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activity.
The monthly outturn was largely subdued on the back of the seasonal decrease in volatile food prices, in addition to the muted movement in the prices of other food, supported by recent government measures to control the prices of basic food items.
In its meeting held on September 16, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
In its meeting held on March 23, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 9.5 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively.
In view of the above and building on previous MPC decisions, the Committee judges that the current monetary stance is appropriate to support the sustained moderation of inflation, and will continue to assess its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.
Additionally, real GDP growth is expected to remain on an accelerating trajectory, which is partially base effect driven from last year’s shrunken base.
Additionally, sectoral growth continued to pick up, as detailed data up to 2021 Q1 showed that it remains supported by the positive contributions of trade, construction, and communications, as well as natural gas extractions.
Against this background, the MPC judges that the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted to the upside.
Monthly headline inflation in August 2016 came mainly due to higher prices of regulated items, primarily electricity, in addition to increases in prices of fresh vegetables and seasonal increases in prices of red meat associated with EidAlAdha.
Moreover, despite tentative signs that the worst of the global downturn may be over, consensual projections point to a sluggish and uneven global economic recovery in 2010.
July 26, 2012 In its meeting held on July 26, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi�ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respec�vely, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
This was largely driven by the continued phasing out of last year’s supply shocks.
The annual headline inflation rates are expected to continue on this declining path as the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks fully level off.
Meanwhile, international prices for oil, food and other commodities have surged to postpandemic highs, with the level of uncertainty increasing regarding their future price trajectories.
Latest available data for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows that GDP growth was mainly driven by the private sector, particularly nonpetroleum manufacturing, tourism, and trade.
This comes on the backdrop of the improving outlook for international commodity prices in light of the projected slowdown in global economic activity and the consequent moderation in domestic economic growth.
However, inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth continues to be a concern.
The slight loosening in the policy stance is also motivated by downside risks to employment and economic growth.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 8.75 percent.
Being keen on safeguarding the achieved macroeconomic stability, the CBE stresses on the importance of the exchange rate flexibility to act as a shock absorber to preserve Egypt’s competitiveness.
Globally, monetary policy tightening cycles in advanced and emerging market economies have contributed to a decline in inflation worldwide, with select central banks continuing to cut interest rates as inflation approaches its target levels.
This outturn has been better than previously expected at the outset of the global financial crisis yet remains below the 7 percent average registered over the past three years.
Consumer prices during November were strongly impacted by the economic reform measures related to the foreign exchange rate market liberalization as well as the hydrocarbon subsidies adjustment.
The reduction in key policy rates in today’s MPC meeting provides appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with price stability over the medium term.
Domestically, inflation rates continued to hold at moderate levels, despite the most recent inchup.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stability.
f In its meeting held on May 29, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Headline CPI inched up by 0.68 percent (m/m) in August compared to an increase of 0.86 percent in July.
Against this background, the MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 300 bps to contain inflationary pressures and to steer annual headline inflation rates towards its upcoming targeted levels.
Furthermore, despite edging down recently, global financial conditions have remained relatively tight as major central banks have continued to raise policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary pressures in their respective countries.
October 28, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Furthermore, monthly headline inflation was affected by retail items, particularly seasonal increases in the prices of clothing and footwear associated with the EidAlFitr festivities.
The acceleration in the prices of red meat and poultry have accounted for 60 percent of annual core inflation between July and September.
Supported by foreign and domestic public investment demand, annual real GDP growth exhibited sustained increases since 2016 Q4, recording in 2018 Q1 a preliminary estimate of 5.4 percent.
Annual headline CPI remained at around 9 percent in February and March 2016, after registering 10 percent in January 2016 and 11 percent in December 2015.
In its meeting on May 17, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 16.75 percent, 17.75 percent, and 17.25 percent, respectively.
Furthermore, the negative contribution of net exports narrowed, mainly due to the recovery of exports which registered its first positive contribution to real GDP growth since 2014/15 Q2, while the negative contribution of imports lessened.
Meanwhile, real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter to record 5.3 percent in December 2017 and 5.0 percent during 2017, the highest economic growth since 2010.
After evaluating the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook to date, the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations over the mediumterm.
Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the mediumterm.
Central Bank of Egypt December 24th, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Monthly headline dynamics came broadly as expected, reflecting seasonal decline in prices of agricultural products, as well as, higher regulated prices in November 2023.
The pickup in consumption in 2020 Q2 was not enough to offset the combined contraction in investments, and to a lesser extent in net exports.
Mindful of the lagged impact of the MPC’s decision to raise key policy rates by an additional 600 basis points, the committee will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook with the aim of strengthening credibility and placing inflation on a downward trajectory.
Moreover, policy rates in major economies are expected to remain elevated given persistent inflation rates globally, in line with moderately tight financial conditions.
In its meeting held on March 10, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline in April 2009, reaching 11.7 percent down from 13.5 percent and 12.1 percent in February and March, respectively.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by 50 basis points to 8.25 percent per annum and cut the discount rate by one percent.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012.
The tight monetary stance aims to steer the future path of annual inflation rates towards the CBE’s upcoming target levels and to safeguard price stability over the medium term.
Growth of bank credit to the private sector is still running at a low level.
Continued weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors weighed heavily on GDP growth during 2011/2012 which suppressed the tenta�ve signs of recovery in the construction sector.
Accordingly, the gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations suggest that inflation is currently on a downward trajectory.
Stepping up the structural economic reform agenda to raise the economy’s potential output, by addressing the impediments that challenge increasing investments.
This process was supported by the combination of previous policy rate increases and the recent stability of the Egyptian pound against tradingpartner currencies.
The continuation of these market imperfections, in addition, to an unanticipated rebound in international food prices pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.
This decelerating trend was sustained despite the unexpected surge in February 2024, as annual headline and core inflation declined to 32.5 percent and 31.8 percent in April 2024, respectively.
Growth was driven by domestic demand, while net external demand contributed negatively.
For international commodity prices, particularly energy, the outlook remains uncertain surrounding demand and supply over the medium term, especially that supply continues to be vulnerable to supply shocks stemming from geopolitical tensions.
Annual food inflation declined in November 2021 for the first time since April 2021, to record 8.1 percent in November 2021 from 11.6 percent in October 2021, due to the decline in the annual contribution of volatile food items, despite higher annual contribution of core and regulated food items.
The Central Bank of Egypt
Trade, real estate, construction and tourism were the main sectors driving economic activity.
The annual rate of inflation declined in the first quarter of 2005.
In its meeting held on November 4, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Hence, the domestic banking system can be characterized as highly liquid and well capitalized.
Leading indicators for 2022 Q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishes.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by a mere 0.4 percent in 2011/2012 Q2 after a similarly feeble growth of 0.3 percent in Q1, following the significant contraction of 4.3 percent recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the political events in Egypt and the region.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have been revised upwards compared to forecasts underlying the August 2023 meeting.
Prices of retail items have not been contributing to headline inflation since March 2017, except in June due to the seasonal effect of EidElFitr on clothing prices.
In its mee�ng held on August 1, 2013, the Monetary Policy Commi�ee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent respectively.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by broad based increases in food and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the exchange rate and diesel distribution bottlenecks across the country.
In addition, annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food and regulated items, continued its upward trend to record 11.9 percent in April 2022, from 10.1 percent in March 2022, its highest level since April 2018.
Nevertheless, there are several risks surrounding the baseline inflation outlook, notably the evolution of inflation expectations, demandside pressures as well as the magnitude of any subsidyreform measures and their secondround effects.
Maintaining price stability by avoiding double digit inflation rates over the mediumterm.
Yet, as the recently implemented measures were anticipated, average annual headline inflation is expected to remain in line with the CBE’s target announced in May 2017, namely 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates, and will continue to monitor all incoming developments underlying the economic outlook.
Excluding effects of transitory shocks, underlying inflation remained somewhat higher than consistent with achieving the CBE’s target, affected by pricesetting behavior in line with annual inflation of 10 percent historically, which has been further magnified recently due to secondround effects of the economic reform measures.
The MPC’s decision to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged is consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation path.
Nevertheless, the diversity of the economy provides some cushion given the resilience of some sectors.
Headline CPI increased by 0.63 percent (m/m) in August compared to an increase of 0.71 in July, while the annual rate decelerated to 7.88 percent in August from 8.38 percent in July, supported by a favorable base effect.
Available data up to June 2017 confirm that increasing economic growth over the previous three quarters was initially mainly driven by the industrial sector, due to nonpetroleum and petroleum manufacturing as well as natural gas extractions, in addition to the tourism sector.
In the meantime, while the widening trade deficit is stalling real GDP growth, investment remained positive for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stabilized at 7.4 percent during 2021 Q1 compared to 7.2 percent during the previous quarter.
Annual headline inflation in April 2020 was driven by higher annual food contribution, mainly core food items, which more than offset lower annual contribution of nonfood items.
Headline CPI decelerated by 0.68 percent (m/m) in December following the 0.82 percent decline in November.
The discount rate was also raised by 200 bps to 18.75 percent.
Against this background, the MPC judged that a less restrictive monetary policy stance is required, at this juncture, in order to stabilize economic growth around its potential.
Annual headline inflation rose to 14.2 percent in August 2018 from 11.4 percent in May 2018, while annual core inflation continued to decline for the twelfth consecutive month to record 8.5 percent in July 2018, before increasing slightly to 8.8 percent in August 2018.
The MPC judges that inflation rates are likely to peak in the second half of 2023 before beginning a disinflation path towards the CBE’s preannounced targets afterwards, supported by the cumulative monetary policy tightening to date.
Overall, the CBE believes that the balance of risks to price stability over the medium term is neutral.
The MPC reiterates that the objective of its tighter stance is not to offset firstround effects of supplyshocks, rather to contain secondround effects and ensure that the inflation outlook is consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation path.
Similarly, forecasts for economic growth have broadly stabilized, while volatility in financial conditions of key advanced economies has eased compared to the previous MPC meeting.
However, this acceleration has not been inflationary.
Annual real GDP growth declined to 3.4 percent in 2016/17 Q1 after averaging 4.3 percent between 2014/15 and 2015/16.
Looking ahead, while upside risks to the inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of broadbased declines in international commodity prices, underlying domestic inflationary pressures could push up inflation expectations.
In its meeting held on February 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
Accordingly, monthly core inflation dropped to 2.61 percent in February 2017 after averaging 4.89 percent between November 2016 and January 2017.
Headline CPI declined by 0.55 percent (m/m) in June following a 0.24 percent (m/m) decline in May, bringing the annual rate to 7.26 percent in June from 8.30 percent recorded in the previous month.
In its meeting held on January 15, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
In its meeting held on June 17, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
In the meantime, core CPI increased by 0.84 percent (m/m) in September compared to an inch up of 0.60 percent 1.79 percent (m/m) in August and July, respectively.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates and will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook.
This can be mainly attributed to the seasonal impact of Eid AlAdha, the repercussions of the RussoUkrainian conflict, as well as, the indirect effects of higher prices of fuel products.
These developments suggest that the international food price shock might be waning, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the outlook of international commodity prices.
This comes on the back of a marked decline in international food prices and the softening of domestic inflationary pressures.
To further anchor inflation expectations, the MPC will continue to announce inflation targets along the predetermined disinflation path that began in 2017, which was on track until the emergence of the recent global shocks.
Similarly, annual core inflation increased to record 41.0 percent in June 2023 from 40.3 percent in May 2023.
While pressures could be expected from possible fiscal consolidation measures, inflation is forecasted to stabilize in 2024 around its current levels.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and In view of the above and given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks, the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to address inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations.
Accordingly, inflation dynamics for the past three months ending in September 2023 mainly reflect the effect of adverse weather conditions, which further amplified the seasonal increase in the prices of agricultural products.
f In its meeting held on February 27, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
As expected, annual urban headline inflation continued its upward trend recording 38.0 percent in September 2023 due to higher food inflation while nonfood inflation softened.
A. SubGovernor, Monetary Policy Unit
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate slightly declined to 7.1 percent in 2023 Q1 compared to 7.2 percent in the previous quarter, mainly due to an increase in employment.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels remained low.
To that end, real GDP growth is expected to soften during fiscal year 2023/24 before gradually pickingup thereafter, in light of actual developments and the negative spill overs from ongoing regional instability and maritime trade disruptions in the Red Sea on the services sector.
Inflation excluding fruits and vegetables accumulated in the first six months of 2009 reached 3.1 percent compared to the 11.5 percent accumulated in 2008H1, reflecting the evident change in the inflation dynamics.
Domestic demand, contributed 4.8 percentage points to the revised 4.5 percent real GDP growth in the first half of 2015/16, while net external demand contributed negative 0.3 percentage points.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than prevailing rates and will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to ensure that the policy stance is set at sufficiently restrictive levels, allow for a sustained decline in underlying inflation, and safeguard price stability over the medium term.
In view of the above and drawing upon the outcome of previous MPC meetings, the Committee judges that current policy rates remain appropriate to maintain the prevailing tight monetary stance until a significant and sustained decline in inflation is realized.
The increase was mainly due to selected food items, particularly selected fresh vegetables, while the contribution of nonfood items remained broadly contained.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 16.25 percent.
Nevertheless, the recently announced gradual easing of lockdown measures is expected to support the recovery of economic activity.
Future decisions will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming data releases.
Consistent with the inflation outlook, the targeted disinflation path, and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate.
Annual headline urban inflation declined to 5.3 percent in February 2020 from 7.2 percent in January 2020, supported by favorable base effect as well as contained underlying inflationary pressures.
Moreover, there is heightened uncertainty related to the global recovery on the back of higher international oil prices given political tensions in the region.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate to 8.5 percent per annum.
Annual food inflation increased for the fourth consecutive month to 6.6 percent in August 2021 from 4.8 percent in July 2021.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 11.75 percent.
The monthly developments in both headline and core inflation since the beginning of the year were largely driven by broad based increases in food and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the exchange rate and diesel distribution bottlenecks across the country.
This comes a�er the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth rate recorded 2.2 percent.
In addition, the recent economic developments reveal that the pick up in economic growth has accelerated in late 2004/05 and early 2005/06.
Furthermore, annual core inflation remained stable at 3.6 percent for the second consecutive month in February 2021.
While inflation has declined worldwide, key central banks have maintained a tight monetary policy stance to ensure that inflation converges to its target level.
However, the annual inflation rates are expected to remain high until the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks and administered price adjustments level off.
The higher monthly inflation in January (4.07 percent) compared to December (3.13 percent) is estimated to be partly driven by relatively higher regular monthly dynamics as well as the introduction of higher custom tariffs in the end of 2016.
The resulting exchange rate movements and significant passthrough of international commodity prices, coupled with domestic supply shocks, have resulted in persistent inflationary pressures driving headline inflation to record levels.
Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before picking up gradually over the medium term.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.54 percent in May following the 0.85 percent in April, while the annual rate inched up to 8.81 percent from 8.76 percent recorded the previous month.
Annual food inflation increased for the fifth consecutive month to 10.6 percent in September 2021 from 6.6 percent in August 2021.
Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID19 pandemic, but has shown some signs of slowdown due to global supply chain disruptions.
The headline and core annual inflation rates thereby registerd the lowest since October and April 2016, respectively.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.4 percent in 2022 Q3, slightly up from the 7.2 percent recorded in the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, in emerging economies the credit risk outlook has improved in anticipation of monetary easing cycles in advanced economies.
In light of these risks and changes in macroeconomic dynamics, the reassessment of the CBE's inflation targets will be clearly communicated.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation have been mainly driven by broad based increase in the prices of food items ahead of the Holy month of Ramadan.
In light of the above, the MPC decided to keep policy rates unchanged.
Hence, a rate hike is warranted.
These risks include the persistence of regional tensions, elevated international commodity prices, and higher than anticipated passthrough of fiscal measures.
In the meantime, the impact of the RussoUkrainian war on the prices of wheat, wheat derivatives, and other food commodities, in addition to the continued seasonal inflationary impact of Ramadan, and the occurrence of multiple holidays during April 2022, increased the prices of the rest of the core food products.
Monetary policy continued to support private domestic demand, which has outpaced net exports as the main driver of economic activity in the first three quarters of 2019, driven by the acceleration in private investment growth.
However, upside risks to the forecasted disinflation path remain, including an escalation of current geopolitical tensions, unfavorable climate conditions, both domestically and globally, and higher than anticipated fiscal measures.
Headline CPI increased by 1.91 percent in May compared to an increase of 0.19 percent in April.
Headline inflation rose to 16.0 percent and 17.7 percent in September and October 2018, respectively, affected by inflation of select fresh vegetables.
Headline CPI increased by 0.99 percent (m/m) in January compared to a decline of 0.07 percent (m/m) in December.
At this juncture, and given the expected lagged effect from the previous interest rate hike, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rates and will continue to pursue its price stability mandate.
Monthly headline inflation in June 2016 came mainly on the back of higher prices of volatile food items, in addition to core food items, particularly red meat and poultry.
The MPC continues to assess the impact of the cumulative policy rate hikes of 1000 bps since March 2022 in addition to the 400 bps increase in the required reserve ratio in September 2022, to contain inflationary pressures in a datadriven manner.
Nonetheless, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate given the lagged transmission of the previous rate hike across the economy combined with the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks at this juncture.
With the gradual easing of previous shocks, inflationary pressures continued to subside, as annual headline and core inflation edged downward for the fifth consecutive month to reach 25.7 percent and 24.4 percent in July 2024, respectively.
MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 11.25 percent, 12.25 percent, and 11.75 percent, respectively.
The slowdown in economic activity is mainly attributed to the declining contribution of the manufacturing sector.
This comes after the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth rate recorded 2.2 percent.
Going forward, economic activity is expected to be supported by the government’s planned structural reforms.
In July 2022, annual headline urban inflation resumed its upward trend, that started in December 2021, to record 13.6 percent, that is after decelerating in June 2022 to record 13.2 percent.
Furthermore, leading indicators for Q2 2024 suggest that economic activity remains subdued.
In the meantime, core inflation rose to 13.25 percent in August 2016 from 12.31 percent in July 2016 as the monthonmonth rate increased to 0.61 percent in August from 0.25 percent in July.
In its meeting held on January 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation increased to 2.7 percent in January 2020 compared to 2.4 percent in December 2019.
September 19, 2013 In its meeting held on September 19, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
In addition, July’s annual core inflation which excludes volatile food and regulated items recorded 15.6 percent in July 2022 from 14.6 percent during the previous month.
Noting that the previous tightening policy rates by 300bps is still transmitting through the economy, the MPC will continue to assess the impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium term.
Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve sustainable economic growth.
The increase in annual inflation since the beginning of 2022 is emanating predominately from supply side issues particularly international commodity prices.
Moreover, concerns related to the global recovery have intensified over the past weeks on the back of heightened worries regarding fiscal challenges facing the Euro Area along with weaker than anticipated growth rates in a number of advanced economies.
The Committee reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than prevailing rates and will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to maintain the disinflation momentum and safeguard price stability over the medium term.
Such shocks elevated riskoff sentiment and inflation expectations, amplifying underlying inflation.
In the meantime, annual core inflation registered 6.6 percent in November 2009 compared to 6.5 percent in October and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.
While most of the upside risks to inflation have eased on the back of the improving outlook for international commodity prices in light of the projected slowdown in global economic activity and the consequent moderation in domestic economic growth, the current inflation rates remain elevated.
Consequently, the MPC decided that raising policy rates by 200 basis points is warranted to anchor inflation expectations and set the policy rate at sufficiently restrictive levels, in order to ensure a decelerating inflation trend.
However, commodity prices remain vulnerable to supply shocks stemming from ongoing geopolitical tensions.
The current level of inflation and future upside risks are largely explained by transitory costpush factors, while demandside factors continue to pose downside risks to the inflation outlook.
The latter factor has contributed to large volatility in financial conditions indices in key markets such as the US and EU, which confirms an increased level of uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook.
Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium term, although global yield curves have steepened recently.
While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.
Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, respectively.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 9 percent and reduce its overnight lending rate by 50 basis points to 11 percent per annum.
The latest monthly development in headline inflation was largely driven by the sharp rise in the prices of butane gas cylinders on the back of bottlenecks in the distribution channels in addition to the annual adjustment in school tuition fees.
Real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 5.7 percent in 2019 Q2 and 5.6 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest in eleven years.
Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth between November 2016 and February 2017 came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation.
Annual headline inflation rates were affected by unfavorable base effects during July 2021 and August 2021 as August 2020 and July 2020 reflected the impact of the COVID19 outbreak and its resulting containment measures on inventory levels and consumption patterns.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 9.5 percent per annum.
In its meeting held on September 17, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 25 bps to 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Additional upward pressure came on the back of a sharp rise in the prices of butane gas cylinders in light of bottlenecks in the distribution channels which relatively eased in December.
In its monthly meeting, held on September 1, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) decided to narrow the width of the corridor from 3% to 2.5%.
While the expansion of global economic activity stabilized, financial conditions and uncertainty regarding trade policies eased somewhat.
Nevertheless, annual inflation rates continued to reflect muted inflationary pressures.
This trend underpins the MPC’s view that the annual headline CPI may have reached its peak.
The outlook for inflation in 2020 Q4 is estimated to be in the low single digits range, with increasing likelihood of coming under the inflation target floor of 6%, further confirming the muted inflationary pressures in the mediumterm.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.4 percent in 2016/17 Q2 from 12.6 percent in Q1, resuming its downward trend after peaking at 13.4 percent in 2013/14 Q2.
Annual headline and core inflation rates continued to decline to record 14.4 percent and 11.9 percent in February 2018, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.
Over the past six weeks, turmoil in the global financial markets has severely intensified, leading many central banks in developed and emerging countries to intervene in their respective domestic markets using all tools available to ease liquidity shortages and ensure that their money markets are orderly functioning.
Global economic growth has slowed down, with its outlook revised downwards compared to the previous meeting given the continued effect of policy rate increases by key central banks on demand.
However, recent developments indicate higher than expected monthly dynamics and sustained inflationary pressures.
Additionally, prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of newer variants.
Nonetheless, the outlook for international commodity prices remains uncertain, as several factors contribute to upside and downside pressures.
Annual headline inflation in May 2017 fell for the first time since October 2016 to record 29.7 percent compared to 31.5 percent in the preceding month.
Accordingly, the financing of loan expansion originates predominantly from domestic deposits, which results in minimal dependence on funds from foreign markets.
Against the above background, the expected slowdown in economic growth could largely offset the upside risks on inflation from the rising international food prices.
Moreover, most leading indicators are gradually recovering to their prepandemic levels.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth for 2010/2011 Q1 registered 5.5 percent following 5.4 percent in 2009/2010 Q4.
During the Coordinating Council meeting on December 17, the government and the CBE have decided to collaborate on designing a macroeconomic framework, aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability that will contribute positively to economic growth and job creation.
Moreover, while the outlook for global economic growth has increased compared to the previous meeting, this outlook could be dampened by weakening growth in China and the Eurozone recently.
Headline CPI increased by 1.57 percent (m/m) in September compared to an inch up of 0.68 percent in August, bringing the annual rate to 10.15 percent in September from 9.74 percent in August.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 1.70 percent (m/m) in September after inching up by 0.14 percent in August, pushing the annual rate to 11.15 percent in September from 8.97 percent recorded in the previous month.
On the other hand, externally, risks to global inflation are still skewed to the upside and uncertainty surrounds the international interest rate outlook.
In addition, annual core inflation increased to record 4.8 percent in September 2021 from 4.5 percent in August 2021.
The continued increase in the prices of volatile food items explain the bulk of monthly headline CPI developments and has widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rates.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 6.6 percent in September 2021 from 5.7 percent in August 2021.
Central Bank of Egypt April 28th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Moreover, most leading indicators remained in positive territory in 2022 Q2.
Meanwhile global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, despite their recent recovery.
Real GDP growth registered 4.3 percent during the first nine months of 2015/16, down from 4.8 percent during the respective period of the previous year.
Accordingly, the annual acceleration in headline and core inflation during June 2023 is driven by broadbased increases in the prices of most of the CPI items.
Annual headline inflation in June 2016 was partly affected by unfavorable base effects from the previous year and remained elevated due to the relatively high monthonmonth inflation in May 2016.
Central Bank of Egypt The Central Bank of Egypt decided not to raise its policy rates.
In the meantime the growth of reserve money is expected to be impacted by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit.
The latest monthly developments showed that the sharp food price increases witnessed in July and August due to the Ramadan effect have moderated in September through October while annual adjustments in school tuition led to a further increase in nonfood prices.
While the CBE acknowledges that the tighter stance could result in a shortterm contraction in the private sector’s real credit growth, the persistence of excessive inflationary pressures poses greater risks to its stability.
The annual rate declined to 9.66 percent in January from 10.13 percent in December, supported by the favorable base effect from last year.
The hardwon macroeconomic gains have provided the CBE with a strong toolkit to implement its monetary policy and maintain price stability over the medium term and with solid buffers to insulate the economy from excessive volatility.
Information received since the MPC met in March show continued improvement of economic activity and a reduction of unemployment.
Headline yearonyear inflation rose to 12.30 percent in May 2016 from 10.27 percent in April, recording at 3.05 percent the highest monthly rate since July 2014.
While the supply shortages related to fruits and vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have largely eased during the past two months, their price increases since the beginning of the year continue to explain more than half of annual headline inflation.
Moreover, to prevent the exacerbation of external spillovers on the domestic economy, prudent and complementary monetary and fiscal policies will place the Egyptian economy on a sustainable path to preserve macroeconomic stability, safeguard debt sustainability, and allow for the accumulation of foreign exchange buffers.
The MPC stresses that achieving a tight monetary stance is a necessary condition to attain the CBE’s upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.
Despite the downside risks to the GDP outlook, the MPC judges that disanchored inflation expectations are more detrimental to the economy over the medium term.
The MPC believes that this target path is appropriate to minimize undesirable macroeconomic volatility.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by a mere 0.3 percent in 2011/2012 Q1 a�er a similarly feeble growth of 0.4 percent in 2010/2011 Q4, following the significant contraction of 4.3 percent recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the poli�cal events in Egypt and the region.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by 50 basis points to 9% and its lending rate by 1% to 11.5% per annum.
The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the decline in domestic food inflation, which fell from 31 percent (y/y) in August 2008 to 13.7 percent (y/y) in April 2009.
Headline CPI increased by 2.50 percent (m/m) in February following an increase of 1.69 percent (m/m) in January.
Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all developments in the economy, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the mediumterm.
The decision was based on an assessment of the recent economic developments, in particular the moderate reduction in inflationary pressures.
This led the annual GDP growth for the whole year 2010/2011 to fall to 1.8 percent from 5.1 percent recorded in 2009/2010.
This process was supported by the combination of previous policy rate increases and the recent appreciation of the Egyptian pound against tradingpartner currencies.
In the meantime, annual real GDP growth in 2008/09 recorded 4.7 percent.
Volatile food items, namely fruits and vegetables, continued to be the determining factor in the overall inflation outturn.
The MPC treats the developments emanating from the Russo Ukrainian conflict to be among the exogenous shocks that are outside the scope of monetary policy and yet may lead to transitory deviations from preannounced target rates.
The current political uncertainty will continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the economy.
The elimination of the parallel foreign exchange market is expected to dampen inflation expectations, rein in underlying inflation and accordingly, headline inflation is projected to follow a steadily decelerating path over the medium term.
It is worth mentioning that the cumulative monthly increase in headline CPI inched up by only 2.2 percent in 2013Q2, a�er increasing by around 5 percent in 2013Q1.
The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 16.25 percent.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.2 percent in 2022 Q4, down from 7.4 percent in the preceding quarter.
Meanwhile, global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy measures despite the ongoing uncertainty.
In its meeting held on July 5, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
Annual real GDP reportedly grew by 4.3 percent in the fiscal year 2015/16 compared 4.4 percent in 2014/15.
As headline inflation for October 2018 has been affected by a higherthanforecasted increase in the prices of fresh vegetables, there is an upside risk of a slight deviation from the inflation target announced in May 2017, which records 13 percent (±3 percent) on average during 2018 Q4.
Domestically, growth of real economic activity remained unchanged in 2023 Q1 at 3.9 percent compared to the previous quarter, implying that the first nine months of fiscal year 2022/23 recorded 4.1 percent.
The MPC will continue to monitor all economic developments.
In its meeting held on March 17, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 150 bps to 10.75 percent, 11.75 percent, and 11.25 percent respectively.
Headline CPI increased by 1.22 percent (m/m) in March following 0.67 percent (m/m) in February, bringing the annual rate to 9.03 percent from 9.19 percent recorded in the previous month.
The decision was based on the observations of emerging inflationary trends, driven by the demand pressures arising from accelerating economic growth mostly in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to below 12.0 percent in the quarter ending June 2017 from 12.0 percent, 12.4 percent and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.
Headline CPI increased by 0.68 percent (m/m) in March compared to a decline of 1.03 percent (m/m) in February, bringing the annual rate to 9.82 percent in March up from 9.76 percent recorded in the previous month.
Additionally, leading indicators point towards a continued expansion across most economic sectors.
Meanwhile, international oil prices continued to increase since the beginning of 2019 and remain subject to volatility due to geopolitical risks and potential supplyside factors, which pose risks to the domestic inflation outlook.
In its monthly meeting held on February 16, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 8.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respectively.
This comes on the backdrop of the decline in international food prices (particularly wheat), imposing a temporary ban on local rice exports and scrapping import tariffs on some basic staple food products.
Upside risks to the forecasted disinflation path, include but are not limited to, an escalation of the current geopolitical tensions, unfavorable climate conditions, both domestically and globally, and a higher than anticipated outturns of fiscal prudence measures.
August 5, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
In light of recent global developments and the reassessment of risks surrounding the inflation outlook and domestic GDP, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rates.
In the meantime, annual core inflation decelerated to 3.8 percent in December 2020 from 4.0 percent in November 2020.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 9.25 percent.
Cutting key policy rates today remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions and with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
The main contributors to growth were the manufacturing, construction, real estate and tourism sectors, while the extractions sector remained weak.
Consequently, policy rates in major economies are expected to remain elevated.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate.
Over the mediumterm, this has the potential to drive inflation above the upper level of the CBE's comfort zone.
Headline CPI inched up by 1.23 percent (m/m) in September, following an increase of 1.09 percent and 3.51 percent (m/m) in August and July, respectively.
In its monthly meeting held on December 1, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the overnight deposit rate to 8.75 percent from 9 percent and the overnight lending rate to 10.75 percent from 11 percent.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP.
The CBE remains committed to take all actions necessary to ensure price stability over the medium term.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rates and as such, will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its price stability mandate.
However, it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international commodity prices, which had begun since August 2008, has not been fully reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic markets.
On the other hand, core food prices registered the lowest increase since August 2016, and prices of services were only affected by the indirect firstround effect of the hydrocarbonsubsidy reforms on inland transportation.
In light of the above, the MPC decided to keep policy rates unchanged and to continue assessing the cumulative impact of previously enacted tightening policies and its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.
Meanwhile, international oil prices started to slightly pick up recently.
Meanwhile, annual nonfood inflation declined to 5.6 percent in June 2021 from 6.3 percent in May 2021, which is its lowest recorded level since June 2014.
Against this background, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than of prevailing inflation rates.
In its meeting held on January 27, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
At the same time, the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in addition to fiscal and structural reform measures are expected to increase potential output growth, which coupled with weaker demand – partly due to tighter monetary conditions – is estimated to partly offset costpush pressures.
This remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
This comes in light of the impact of actual developments and the negative spillovers emanating from geopolitical tensions in the region, especially on the services sector.
Economic activity remained sluggish in 2012/2013 on the back of modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing, construction and tourism, in addition to the contraction in the petroleum sector.
Annual real GDP grew by a revised 4.3 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening from the 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 3.6 percent recorded in 2015/16 Q3.
Globally, economic activity remained weak despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy measures despite the ongoing uncertainty.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 4.9 percent in 2009/10 Q1 compared to the four year low of 4.1 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2.
Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement for disinflation.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates.
The risks to the domestic inflation outlook are lower in light of the deteriorating prospects for global growth in 2009 and given the sharply declining international commodity prices.
Furthermore, leading indicators point towards a sustained momentum of recovery across the board.
Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a prerequisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real incomes.
Meanwhile, international food and other commodity prices have continued to rise, as international oil prices remained elevated relative to their postpandemic levels.
The annual headline inflation rates are expected to maintain this downward trend as the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks completely dissipate.
Global economic activity has slowed down due to ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Furthermore, the unemployment rate recorded 7.3 percent in 2020 Q3, the lowest rate on record, and down from 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2.
Moreover, further spillover to nonfood prices contributed to the latest inflation outturn.
Reducing the country’s trade deficit by initiating a strategy aimed at encouraging local production to meet domestic market needs and enhance imports substitutions.
Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to soften further in FY 2023/24 compared to the previous fiscal year.
On the global front, forecasts for the global economic activity have dampened due to spillover effects from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Since the beginning of calendar year 2022, annual food inflation was mainly driven by core food inflation.
In its meeting held on February 16, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 14.75 percent, 15.75 percent, and 15.25 percent, respectively.
The headline CPI jumped to 10.5 percent in January and accelerated further to 12.1 in February, 2008, exceeding the central bank’s comfort zone.
Moreover, the MPC is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressures.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by higher prices of several food items.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3, up from 1.7 percent during 2020 Q2.
Against the above background, the slowdown in economic growth should limit upside risks to the inflation outlook.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and challenges facing the Euro Area could pose downside risks to domestic GDP.
Economic activity was affected by the impact of COVID19 and its resulting containment measures.
The recent increase reflected an expected upward adjustment of regulated hydrocarbon prices and a higher VAT rate.
In its meeting held on June 29, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates at 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than prevailing rates and will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to ensure that the policy stance is set at sufficiently restrictive levels that allow for a sustained decline in underlying inflation, and safeguard price stability over the medium term.
The CBE will discuss with the government these objectives during the first Coordinating Council meeting scheduled on December 17.
On March 14, 2016, the CBE decided to adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime that better reflects the underlying forces of supply and demand and in order to correct the imbalances that affected the foreign exchange flows in the banking sector.
Monthly headline inflation in January 2020 was mainly driven by higher food prices as well as by higher nonfood prices but with a lesser extent.
Accordingly, inflation dynamics for both July and August 2023 reflect mainly the combined effect of adverse weather conditions further amplifying the seasonal increase in prices of agricultural products, as well as, supply chain disruptions.
Globally, the expansion of economic activity stabilized, financial conditions and uncertainty regarding trade policies eased.
This should support employment in these exceptional times which is essential in order to avoid a prolonged slowdown in economic activity and help speed the recovery once the outbreak is contained.
Exogenous factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy may lead to transitory deviations from preannounced target rates.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
Global economic growth has continued to slow down given the continued effect of policy rate increases by key central banks on demand.
Developments in the external environment show some firming of international commodity prices on annual terms, despite registering monthly declines since March 2017 mainly on the back of crude oil prices, while food prices declined at a relatively slower pace.
Domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2022 Q1, albeit at a slower pace, registering a preliminary growth figure of 5.4 percent, compared to 8.3 percent in 2021 Q4.
Monetary policy tightening cycles in advanced and emerging market economies have contributed to a decline in inflation worldwide, with select central banks continuing to cut interest rates as inflation approaches its target levels.
Furthermore, the government’s successful implementation of several measures to avoid supply shortages in the market contributed to lower inflation rates.
Sectoral GDP growth was supported by the positive contributions of trade, construction and communication, while tourism and nonpetroleum manufacturing continue to weigh down on growth despite their recent pickup.
As a result, real GDP growth averaged 4.6 percent during the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/10.
Furthermore, growth continues to be led by private sector economic activity, supported by the positive contributions of trade, agriculture and construction.
In its meeting held on March 18, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Furthermore, the ongoing recovery in the global economy coupled with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic economy.
Against the above and despite the sharp increase in food prices, nonfood inflation has remained largely subdued since early 2009, implying that underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained.
Trade sanctions imposed on Russia and corresponding supplychain bottlenecks have elevated global commodity prices, such as international prices for oil and wheat, with the latter’s global supply also impacted by adverse weather conditions and poor harvests in select regions.
This comes after fiscal consolidation measures led headline inflation to rise from the twentyfivemonth low of 11.4 percent in May 2018.
In its meeting held on June 9, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively, and the 7day repo at 9.25 percent.
Prudent regulatory surveillance and effective banking supervision, which have been strengthened under the Central Bank of Egypt’s Banking Sector Reform Program launched in 2004, have ensured that the Egyptian banking system continues to function normally amid the global financial turmoil.
This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction sector.
Additionally, leading indicators for Q3 2024 suggest that real economic activity is gradually recovering, and is expected to realize its full potential by FY 2025/26.
Nonetheless, the MPC is mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other prices.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent in 2016/17 Q3 from 12.4 and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.
Monthly developments have been largely driven by the rise in food prices.
In its meeting held on December 13, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
In its monthly meeting held on October 5, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to further narrow the width of the corridor from 2.50 percent to 2 percent by reducing the overnight lending rate from 11.5 percent to 11 percent.
Furthermore, key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have declined compared to the previous meeting, mainly due to reduced speculation over oil supply shortages and dampening global demand.
Meanwhile, international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supplyside factors that include geopolitical risks.
On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have slightly eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting.
May 2022 inflation reading continued to be affected by the depreciation of the Egyptian Pound, as well as by the repercussions of the RussoUkrainian conflict on commodities.
While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation outlook, there are possible upward pressures on inflation going forward.
The balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook as well as the transmission of previous MPC decisions to the economy will continue to be assessed in a datadriven manner.
On the other hand, core CPI increased marginally by 0.28 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate declined to 7.04 percent in June from 7.22 percent in May.
Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks at this juncture, MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.
Annual headline CPI inflation remained largely unchanged at 13.3 percent in November 2009, reflecting the accumulated sharp acceleration in the prices of fruits and vegetables that had occurred between February and October 2009, which has accounted for more than 50 percent of the annual headline inflation.
Meanwhile, real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q3, growing by 2.50 percent compared to the 1.04 and 1.44 percent recorded in the previous two quarters, respectively.
Given the unfavorable base effect from last year, the annual rate increased to 8.04 percent from 7.47 percent recorded in April 2013.
Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium term.
The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 12.75 percent.
Against this background, the MPC decided that raising policy rates is necessary to contain inflationary pressures which is consistent with achieving price stability over the medium term.
In its meeting held on November 2, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to raise its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates to 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent from 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
On the other hand, after jumping by 2.82 percent in August, core CPI inched up by 0.22 percent in September, while the annual rate declined to 7.59 percent from 8.16 percent in August.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth continued to strengthen in the quarter ending June 2017 and leading activity indicators solidify this improvement.
Global economic activity continues to display signs of recovery and resilience in the face of the COVID19 pandemic, albeit with varying paces across countries and economic sectors.
While the early days in February witnessed a marked increase in food prices driven by disruptions in production lines as well as transportation networks this was largely reversed in recent weeks.
It is important to underscore that during the first six months of 2009, transient supply shocks mainly related to volatile food items, namely fruits and vegetables, have emerged.
In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up slightly to 3.7 percent in March 2021 from 3.6 percent in February 2021.
Nonfood items were the main drivers of inflation during August and September , reflecting the impact of fiscal measures, and offsetting the easing of previous shocks, the decline in food inflation, and favorable base effects.
While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous statements continue to exist, the MPC judges that inflation maybe reaching its peak.
The committee will not hesitate to utilize all its available tools to ensure that the policy stance is set at sufficiently restrictive levels with the aim of attaining the CBE’s upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.
February 2, 2012 In its meeting held on February 2, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
Headline CPI declined by 1.02 percent (m/m) in December after recording an increase of 0.95 (m/m) in November, bringing the annual rate to 11.66 percent in December down from 12.97 percent in the previous month.
Detailed sectoral data for 2022 Q3 show that growth was primarily driven by private sector economic activity, specifically tourism, agriculture and trade.
Meanwhile, real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q2, growing by 1.4 percent compared to the 1.04 percent recorded in the quarter ending September 2013.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor developments in the economy and the factors affecting inflation, and will take all actions necessary to ensure price stability over the medium term.
Effects of the regulated price adjustments implemented in July 2014 explain the bulk of the price developments during the quarter.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stabilized at 7.3 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 7.4 percent in 2021 Q1.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) moved preemptively, within its mandate, to support economic activity especially businesses and households.
The next meeting is scheduled on January 10, 2016.
The Central Bank of Egypt 2 June 2005
Moreover, while more than 40 percent of annual core inflation is attributed to the acceleration in the prices of red meat and poultry witnessed during 2010, less than 25 percent is explained by the inchup in the prices of nonfood items.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation slightly declined to 4.5 percent in August 2021 from 4.6 percent in July 2021, after having increased from 3.8 percent in June 2021.
The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective.
Accordingly, the acceleration in September 2021 was mainly driven by higher annual contribution of food items.
Detailed sectoral growth data for 2021 Q4 portrays that economic activity was supported by the robust positive contribution of tourism, nonpetroleum manufacturing and trade.
The unemployment rate registered further improvement in March 2018, declining to 10.6 percent, the lowest since December 2010.
In its meeting held on December 5, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
This coupled with increased uncertainty about the nascent global recovery could potentially weigh on domestic economic activity going forward.
The drop in headline CPI was particularly intensified as base effects caused by last year’s supply shocks continue to level off.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels con�nued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 11.4 percent in 2011/2012 Q1.
Headline yearonyear inflation rose to 15.47 percent in August 2016 from 14.0 percent in July 2016 as the monthonmonth rate increased to 1.93 percent in August from 0.74 percent in July.
Annual headline and core inflation declined to 9.4 percent and 6.4 percent in June 2019 from 14.1 percent and 7.8 percent in May 2019, respectively, recording the lowest rates since more than three years.
This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic economy.
Against this background, the MPC's assessment of the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and growth outlook over the mediumterm remains unchanged as risks to the domestic growth outlook continue to be on the downside while inflationary pressures are subsiding.
The monthly developments in October came on the back of increases in public and private education fees, which usually coincide with the beginning of the school year.
Prior to the RussoUkrainian war, domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2021 Q4, recording a preliminary yearonyear growth rate of 8.3 percent, the second highest real GDP growth rate since 2002 Q3.
On the other hand, net exports contributed negatively to GDP in H1, driven by weaker exports, while imports have been contributing positively, given their relative decline.
Annual headline urban inflation decelerated to 5.4 percent in December 2020 from 5.7 percent in November 2020.
This was coupled with another decision to cut the discount rate to 9 percent from 10 percent.
Globally, the expansion of economic activity weakened.
Having weighed both the international and domestic information available, today's decision is aimed at containing inflation expectations.
The latter has been the main driver of real growth since 2022 Q1 on average, which comes in line with exchange rate developments.
The expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q2 came on the back of the continued growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities for the second consecutive quarter after several quarters of contraction.
Against this background and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that a preemptive rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations and hence limit a generalized price increase, which is detrimental to the economy over the mediumterm.
Similarly, annual core inflation which excludes volatile food and regulated items increased to 16.7 percent in August 2022 from 15.6 in July 2022.
This mainly came on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sectors.
Detailed growth figures in 2020 Q3 illustrate that consumption continued to support economic activity, offsetting the combined unfavorable contributions of gross domestic investments and net exports.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 2.6 percent in 2012/2013 Q1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2011/2012.
However, disruptions to global economic activity following the recent coronavirus outbreak could weigh on the global economic outlook, at least in the near term.
Consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance, annual reservemoney growth adjusted by overnight deposits and sevenday deposit auctions shrunk to reflect the absorption of excess liquidity via longerterm open market operations.
Moreover, downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth emerging markets.
A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in H1 2025 due to the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and favorable base effects.
Moreover, the unemployment rate continued to decline to record 8.1 percent in 2019 Q1, compared to 8.9 percent in the previous quarter.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 5.0 percent in 2020 Q1 as expected, down from 5.6 percent in 2019 Q4, as economic activity in the month of March 2020 was partially affected by the impact of COVID19 and the resulting containment measures.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have recorded a preliminary figure of 2.8 percent in fiscal year 2020/21, compared to 3.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, reflecting the full year impact of the pandemic’s outbreak and its related containment measures on economic activity.
These unfolding developments will likely keep annual inflation rates high until the combined effects of price increases related to the international food price shock and the current regulated price adjustments taper off.
May 3, 2012 In its meeting held on May 3, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 12.75 percent.
While the unfavorable developments in the prices of volatile food items have flattened the disinflation path, they do not characterize the underlying inflationary pressures.
In the meantime, annual core inflation declined to 0.7 percent in July 2020 from 1.0 percent in June 2020, the lowest rate on record.
Domestically, growth of real economic activity remained unchanged in 2023 Q1 at 3.9 percent compared to the previous quarter.
Annual urban headline inflation increased to record 37.4 percent in August 2023 from 36.5 percent in July 2023.
In addition, the MPC decided to increase the required reserve ratio by 400 bps in September 2022.
Additionally, most leading indicators point towards a slowdown of real GDP growth in 2023 Q1.
Global financial conditions continue to be accommodative.
Against this background, and following the cumulative reduction of 350 basis points over the previous three MPC meetings, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation outlook, there is a possible build‐up of upward pressures on inflation going forward for the previously mentioned reasons.
Similar to the headline, the annual core inflation rate declined to 11.69 percent in January from 11.91 in December on the back of favorable base effects from last year.
The contribution of real output growth by the private sector witnessed a broad-based increase in 2019 Q2 for the first time since 2017 Q2, and real private demand growth has been picking up to support the stability of real aggregate demand growth.
The MPC will consider a measured rate cut when needed, so as to prevent economic growth from falling below its potential.
In its meeting held on June 18, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9 percent and the overnight lending rate by 50 bps to 10.5 percent.
As anticipated, upward adjustments of regulated prices as well as higher prices of fresh fruits and vegetables contributed to the widening spread between headline and core inflation since June 2018.
This comes as a continuation of a trend that started in February 2009 whereby shocks related to fruits and vegetables, amplified annual headline inflation, accounting for 54 percent of the 10.8 percent recorded in September 2009.
Additionally, prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of new variants.
Annual headline inflation continued to reflect muted inflationary pressures registering below 6 percent since February 2020.
In September 2020, annual core inflation is expected to be affected by unfavorable base effect, given the release of the 10 CPI series as well as its linking methodology with the 9 CPI series starting with September 2019 data.
Real GDP growth stabilized, recording a preliminary estimate of 5.6 percent in 2019 Q3, after recording 5.6 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest growth since fiscal year 2007/08.
In its meeting held on December 16, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained broadly stable at 7.1 percent in 2023 Q3.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium term.
Therefore, in accommodation of the first round effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafter.
The MPC decision was a result of differing inflationary signals.
The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the mediumterm.
Looking ahead, while the upside risks to the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the subdued international commodity prices, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures are still under watch.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.2 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 7.4 percent in the previous quarter.
Moreover, leading indicators point towards a sustained strong pickup across most sectors.
Nonetheless, inflation is expected to decline significantly in Q1 2025 due to the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and favorable base effect.
While the impending global recession will impact exports of goods and services negatively, growth momentum that has been building up over the past three years will contribute to a soft landing for the Egyptian economy, supported mainly by domestic demand.
In its meeting held on May 14, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9.5 percent and the overnight lending rate by 100 bps to 11 percent.
The committee notes that the future path of inflation remains a function of the cumulative tightening in its stance to date and the lag with which monetary policy tools operate.
The downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forward.
As upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to moderate as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments, annual inflation is projected to ease from their current levels in the coming months.
Domestically, economic activity extended its robust recovery in 2021 Q3, recording a preliminary figure of 9.8 percent, the highest real GDP growth rate since the beginning of the quarterly series in fiscal year 2001/02.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forward.
In the meantime, domestic GDP growth softened during the first half of 2008/09, a consequence of the global economic slowdown.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 13.1 percent in April 2022, from 10.5 percent in March 2022, its highest level since May 2019.
Compared to the last MPC, median forecasts for Brent oil prices are broadly stable, while international prices for food and some other commodities remain at multiyear highs.
In light of the above, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate at this juncture, and will continue assessing the cumulative impact of previously enacted tightening policies and its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.
GDP growth recorded 7.7 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 2.9 percent during the preceding quarter.
As incoming data continues to confirm the moderation of inflation expectations, the reduction of policy rates in today’s MPC meeting provides appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with achieving price stability over the mediumterm.
The most recent development came about as the base effect from last year’s administered price adjustment and part of the avian flu supply shock started to level off.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent in 2016/17 Q3 from 12.4 percent and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.
The annual rate eased to 9.15 percent in September, after it increased to 10.07 percent in August up from 9.57 percent in July, also due to the favorable base effect from the previous year.
The expansion of global economic activity weakened, and the tightening of financial conditions eased, while trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outlook.
Annual headline urban inflation declined in October and November 2021, to record 6.3 percent and 5.6 percent from 6.6 percent in September 2021, respectively.
Concurrently, international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to increase.
Inflation readings are expected to continue to be affected by unfavorable base effects in the near term.
In its meeting held on July 6, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 200 basis points to 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
This was partially supported by the robust growth in tourism, construction and manufacturing, as well as a positive base effect emanating from the low growth rates in the same period in 2020, resulting from the COVID19 containment measures.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 12.25 percent.
Furthermore, the Committee will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook.
The bulk of the monthly increase occurred due to core items, particularly food and retail, which came in addition to higher regulated prices.
The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 18.25 percent.
In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par�cipants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private sector.
Furthermore, the MPC has noticed that in addition to manufacturing and construction, other sectors have started to record higher growth rates that may precipitate more inflationary pressures.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.44 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 0.25 percent (m/m) in November on the back of sporadic movements in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food prices.
It is important to underscore that the pick up in international food prices since late 2010 have had limited spillover effects on domestic food prices.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were driven by increases in several food prices combined with a number of non‐food prices.
Annual headline CPI inflation increased to 10.8 percent in September 2009, compared to 9 percent in August.
Furthermore, leading indicators point towards a sustained improvement across most sectors.
The MPC continues to assess the impact of the frontloaded tightening policies in a datadriven manner, with recent inflation developments showing higher broadbased inflation across CPI items.
Leading indicators for 2023 Q1 point towards a slowdown of real GDP growth.
The inflation outlook remains in line with achieving the inflation target.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stabilized at 7.5 percent in 2021 Q3, compared to 7.3 percent during the preceding quarter.
In its meeting held on August 16, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
September 16, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
The government has revised up the prices of several regulated items within the CPI basket including fuel, electricity, and tobacco as part of the 2014/2015 fiscal consolidation plan.
However, the COVID19 outbreak as well as the associated containment measures induce a considerable disruption to economic activity and financial markets globally.
This comes as negative annual food inflation eased for the second consecutive month.
The MPC judges that interest rate increases are highly likely at this juncture.
Accordingly, the annual rate decelerated to 11.39 percent in June from 13.11 percent in May, supported partially by the favorable base effect from the previous year.
This remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions; a necessary requirement to achieve the inflation target of 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
The witnessed strong dynamics reflect the combined effect of several factors.
The overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates were kept at 9.5 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the considerable decline in domestic food inflation.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.5 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 13.4 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, supported by lower real unit labor costs relative to productivity.
Globally, the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outlook.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3, up from 1.7% during 2020 Q2.
In its meeting held on July 29, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
However, economic activity is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously projected, given the uncertainty and negative spillovers from the global scene.
In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of net exports.
Output growth by economic activity was relatively diversified, and continued to be mostly supplied by the private sector.
While the immediate oneoff effect would be reflected in the next inflation reading, the consequent second round effects of these price adjustments pose an upside risk to the inflation prospects.
Moreover, the passthrough to domestic inflation from global financial market developments remained contained due to domestic policy measures that support improving macroeconomic fundamentals.
For the third consecutive month, the increase in food inflation came due to higher prices of volatile food items as opposed to core food items in earlier months.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.75 percent.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by25 basis points to 8.75 percent per annum.
MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 18.25 percent, 19.25 percent, and 18.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation recorded 2.4 percent in December 2019 compared to 2.1 percent in November 2019, mainly due to higher poultry prices.
Looking ahead, upside risks to the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of broadbased declines in international commodity prices.
In addition, forecasts for headline inflation in key global economies have been revised downwards compared to the June MPC meeting, despite remaining above their respective target levels.
Meanwhile, annual nonfood inflation declined, supported by broadly stable prices in March 2021 as well as favorable base effects.
The MPC is watching these developments and is weighing the possible effects of the above on inflation in the near future.
Updated leading indicators for Q2 2024 indicate that real GDP growth has started to pick up and is expected to gradually recover as of fiscal year 2024/25, following a marked slowdown in fiscal year 2023/24.
Meanwhile, annual headline inflation registered 31.46 percent.
In the meantime, annual core inflation increased only slightly to 4.0 percent in November 2020 from 3.9 percent in October 2020.
Meanwhile, global financial conditions have tightened, as major central banks have continued to both tighten policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary concerns in their respective countries.
In addition, financial conditions broadly stabilized, with several central banks indicating that their inflation may have peaked and potentially started its deceleration path.
Moreover, the annual inflation of services was mainly driven by expenditure on restaurants and cafes, while the increase in retail items was broadbased.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.97 percent (m/m) in April compared to 0.51 percent (m/m) in March, bringing the annual rate to 7.47 percent in April from 7.03 percent in March.
In light of the above, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 200 bps and reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates.
Meanwhile, a number of leading indicators started showing signs of recovery in June and July 2020, in tandem with the easing of the containment measures.
The annual headline CPI inflation eased further in May 2007, recording 10 percent (y/y) compared to 12.8 percent (y/y) in March 2007.
The main contributors to growth during 2014/15 Q3 were the internal trade, construction, building and the real estate sectors, while the extractions sector remained weak.
Upside risks from imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower international food price forecasts in light of global developments.
Meanwhile, real GDP picked up significantly in 2013/2014 Q4, growing by 3.70 percent compared to 2.50 percent, 1.44 percent and 1.04 percent recorded in Q3, Q2 and Q1, respectively.
The MPC will continue to follow a datadriven approach to determine the sufficient level and duration of restriction based on its assessment of the inflation outlook, dynamics of underlying inflation, and strength of monetary policy transmission.
Fruits and vegetables continued to be the determining factor in the headline inflation outturn, contributing by 1.1 percentage points to the monthly increase of 1.8 percentage points recorded in September 2009.
Nevertheless, given elevated monthly inflation rates, annual headline and core inflation registered 30.25 percent and 33.10 percent in February 2017, respectively.
June 17, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.
February 15,2018 In its meeting held on February 15, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 100 basis points to 17.75 percent, 18.75 percent, and 18.25 percent, respectively.
Employment rose, contributing favorably to the continued decline of the unemployment rate to 7.5 percent in 2019 Q2, thereby narrowing by almost 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013 Q4.
As expected, annual headline inflation reversed its upward trend and decelerated in both October and November 2023 due to favourable base effects; to record 34.6 percent in November 2023 down from 35.8 percent in October 2023.
In the meantime, core CPI declined by 0.23 percent in August compared to an increase of 0.30 in July, leading the annual rate to drop to 5.61 percent in August from 6.49 percent in July.
Yet, ongoing uncertainties surrounding the projected slowdown of external demand pose downside risks to domestic economic growth.
The Ramadan effect exacerbated the impact of supply shortages in red meat and poultry witnessed since early 2010, which caused a surge in their prices during the past two months.
In addition, supply factors, chiefly the outbreak of Avian flu as well as administered price adjustments, most importantly the July fuel price hike, have had varying degrees of initial costpush effects on inflation and the second round effects are becoming evident.
This development has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stance.
Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook include the evolution of inflation expectations, the timing and magnitude of potential subsidyreform measures, as well as demandside pressures.
Incoming information since the MPC last met were broadly as expected, accordingly, the MPC judges that current policy rates remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
By sector, the services sector was the highest contributor to economic growth, particularly construction and real estate, while tourism contributed negatively.
To that end, the CBE will begin the process of gradually repealing Letter No.
Moreover, broad money growth is strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
In the meantime while prices of fresh vegetables inchedup, prices of other food items continued to decelerate supported by the decline in international prices, notwithstanding the seasonal pickup in September due to Eid AlAdha.
Against this backdrop, Egypt is intent on intensifying its reform agenda to secure macroeconomic stability and achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Annual headline CPI inflation dropped to 14.3 percent in January 2009 compared to 20.3 percent and 18.3 percent in November and December 2008, respectively.
Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the mediumterm.
October 18, 2012 In its meeting held on October 18, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi�ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respec�vely, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
Real GDP growth at market prices increased in 2020 Q4 to record a preliminary figure of 2.0 percent, up from 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3 and a contraction of 1.7 percent during 2020 Q2.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy given the latest global market developments could pose downside risks to domestic GDP.
Accordingly, higher annual non-food inflation led annual core inflation to increase slightly to 2.7 percent in October 2019 from 2.6 percent in September 2019, the lowest rate since April 2006.
The slower growth rates witnessed in the manufacturing sector, in addition to the contraction in Suez Canal activity and exports, have led to the evident retreat in domestic economic growth.
The MPC judges that demand side pressures have recently increased, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity, higher broadbased inflation outturns, and higher broad money growth.
This decision was based on an assessment of recent domestic and external economic developments since the last MPC meeting.
Going forward, the dire prospects for global growth in 2009 are likely to exert further downward pressures on external demand with unfavorable repercussions on the domestic growth outlook.
Meanwhile, slightly offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual nonfood inflation to 5.3 percent in August 2021 from 5.7 percent in July 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since April 2014.
While economic growth is broadly stable, the outlook remains subject to downside risks due to the dampening effect of monetary tightening on economic activity.
Given the increases in core items, annual core inflation rose to 30.86 percent in January 2017 due to average monthly inflation of 4.89 percent between November 2016 and January 2017 .
Meanwhile, international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risks.
In addition, annual core inflation continued to decelerate for the fifth consecutive month, recording 35.9 percent in November 2023, down from 38.1 percent in October 2023.
The effects on the Egyptian banking sector, however, have been minimal in light of prudent regulations and comfortable domestic liquidity conditions.
Meanwhile, core inflation declined to 7.9 percent in November 2018 from 8.9 percent in October 2018, recording the lowest rate since February 2016.
Despite tentative signs of moderation in international wheat prices, the domestic inflation outlook is affected by the latest regulated price adjustments.
The preemptive tightening policy response aims to anchor inflation expectations at the upcoming inflation target of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4.
From the monetary perspective, broad and reserve money growth are likely to be impacted going forward by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit as well as relatively higher foreign reserves accumulation.
Meanwhile, unemployment rate recorded 7.8 percent in 2019 Q3 compared to 7.5 percent in 2019 Q2, the lowest level on record.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent.
Incoming data since the November MPC, including the recent inflation dynamics, came broadly in line with expectations.
Excluding revaluation effects, annual broad money growth increased to 22.1 percent in May 2017, mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets as well as higher loans to the private sector, while the contribution of net claims on the government eased given higher net external and nonbank financing.
Nevertheless, employment continued to recover for the third consecutive quarter.
During October 2017, annual headline and core inflation declined for the third consecutive month to record 30.8 percent and 30.5 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 16.75 percent.
Annual headline urban inflation accelerated for the third consecutive month to 5.7 percent in November 2020 from 4.5 percent in October 2020.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation continued to be supported by favorable base effects since March 2017, dropping to 30.6 percent in May from 33.1 percent in February.
Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID19 pandemic, although growth remains uneven across regions, as the pace of vaccinations varies across countries.
It continued its upward trend to record 13.3 percent in May 2022 from 11.9 percent in the previous month.
While the supply shortages related to fruits and vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have largely eased during the past three months, their price increases since the beginning of 2010 continue to explain more than 40 percent of annual headline inflation.
From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 7.2 percent.
Domestic Inflation and Economic Growth For the first time since November 2007, annual headline CPI inflation declined to 21.5% in September compared to 23.6% in August, as domestic food inflation has fallen from 31% to 25.6%.
The annual rate declined to 9.75 percent from 10.28 percent in July due to a favorable base effect.
The latest data available reveals that real GDP grew robustly by 4.2 percent in 2014/15 after recording 2.2 percent (y/y) growth in 2013/14.
In its meeting held on May 10, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
In the meantime, domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q2 softened, declining to 4.1 percent compared to 5.8 percent in the previous quarter and 7.1 in 2007/08, chiefly a consequence of the continuing global economic slowdown.
The annual inflation rates continued to be affected by persistent supply shocks, which fed through higher underlying pressures.
Globally, economic activity remained subdued despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policymeasures despite the ongoing uncertainty.
The drop was mainly driven by consumption, while the contribution of gross fixed investment held steady as the increase in private investment offset the decline in public investment.
In its last meeting on February 15, 2018 the MPC began to ease its tight stance on interest rates that successfully managed to tame monthly inflation.
Central Bank of Egypt The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9 percent per annum.
Moreover, the unemployment rate decreased to 7.3 percent in 2020 Q3, down from 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2.
Real GDP growth had stabilized around 5.6 percent in 2019 H2, which was the same level recorded in FY2018/19.
The discount rate was also raised by 300 basis points to 16.75 percent.
Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sectors.
Headline CPI increased by 1.20 percent (m/m) in July following the 0.42 percent in June, while the annual rate declined from 11.79 percent to 10.36 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last year.
Furthermore, the committee will not hesitate to utilize all its available tools to attain a tight policy stance and calibrate liquidity conditions accordingly.
In the meantime, core CPI increased by 1.79 percent (m/m) in July compared to 0.68 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate increased to 9.57 percent in July compared to 8.76 percent in June and was partially limited by a favorable base effect from the previous year.
Egypt’s reform program has placed the economy on a strong footing to weather economic disruptions as they emerge.
Headline inflation registered 1.69 percent (m/m) in April 2017, recording its third consecutive decline due to fading costpush pressures after averaging 4.01 percent (m/m) between November 2016 and January 2017.
Real GDP growth continued to increase for the third consecutive quarter to record 5.0 percent at market prices in 2016/17 Q4, thereby averaging 4.6 percent in the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/2010.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, registering the lowest rate since 2011/12.
Globally, economic activity remains subdued despite the accommodative financial conditions, as the outbreak of the second wave of COVID19 pandemic and its related lockdown measures weigh on the nearterm outlook.
Moreover, increases in the prices of inland transportation, fresh vegetables & fruits and other food items can be partly attributed to the indirect effects of the regulated price adjustments as well as the seasonal effect of Ramadan.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10 percent per annum.
Rising international commodity prices resulting from further supply chain disruptions in addition to increased riskoff sentiment have added to domestic inflationary pressures as well as external imbalances.
This rebound was largely driven by a significant favorable base effect from the respective quarter of 2010/2011 during which economic activity was interrupted following the unfolding political events.
Preliminary figures announced recently show that real GDP growth for FY19/20 recorded 3.5 percent, down from 5.6 percent in the previous fiscal year.
The MPC continues to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated deviations from the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
The decline was further affected by the release of the 10th CPI series as well as its linking methodology with the 9th CPI series.
In its meeting held on September 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
The annual rate accelerated to 13.19 percent in May from 10.96 percent in April, partly due to the unfavorable base effect from last year.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 9.75 percent.
In view of the above, and the previous MPC decisions to raise key policy rates by a cumulative 800 basis points in Q1 2024, the Committee judges that the current monetary stance remains appropriate to place inflation on a declining trend, and will continue to assess its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.
However, risks to the disinflation path are tilted to the upside given tighter global oil supplies, escalation of regional geopolitical tensions, uncertainty regarding the adoption of protectionist trade policies, and higher than anticipated passthrough of fiscal measures.
Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to be impacted by transitory costpush factors stemming from the economic reform measures before beginning to narrow.
Consequently, Egypt weathered large capital outflows and rising commodity prices.
While these monthly rates are exceptionally high, they have been mainly driven by higher prices of a number of food items, which had witnessed seasonal increases of varying degrees in July and August ahead of and during the month of Ramadan.
In accordance with the CBE’s resolve to achieve price stability over the medium term and in line with the preannounced disinflation target path, the MPC has set its upcoming inflation targets at 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.
Widespread inflationary pressures remain elevated, continuing to impact pricing and consumption behaviours.
Moving forward, the MPC will keep monitoring the global and domestic conditions for further developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium term.
Domestically, real GDP growth registered 2.7 percent in 2023 Q3 compared to 2.9 percent in the previous quarter.
The annual rate increased to 9.90 percent in March up from 9.70 in February.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.76 percent in March compared to 1.10 percent in February, while the annual rate inched up to 7.21 percent in March after registering 7.15 percent in February.
The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 11.75 percent.
The MPC will continue to monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance in line with its price stability mandate.
Moreover, while the prices of food items decelerated in August, there was a seasonal pick up in September which coincided with Eid ElAdha.
The latter, however, were mostly confined to seasonal items associated with Haj season and the beginning of the school year.
Headline CPI increased by 1.69 percent in September after accelerating by 2.85 percent in August, while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 10.97 percent in September.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 10 percent per annum.
In its meeting held on February 12, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates by 100 bps to 10.5 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
In its monthly meeting, held today on Thursday, July 7, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged.
While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous statements continue to exist, a detailed assessment of the most recent inflation figures may suggest a tentative moderation.
Annual headline urban inflation inched up to 4.5 percent in February 2021 from 4.3 percent in January 2021, after having decelerated from 5.4 percent in December 2020.
Moreover, the recent uptick in private economic activity was not sufficient to offset the decline in public economic activity.
In light of the above developments and given the CBE’s monetary policy horizon of its inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 100 basis points to reign in inflationary pressures while supporting economic activity.
The MPC believes that such a flexible monetary targeting framework is appropriate under the liberalized exchange rate regime.
Real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter, to record 5.3 percent in December 2017 and an average of 5.0 percent during 2017, the highest since 2010.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate.
Over the nearterm, domestic economic activity is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand, and in specific, gross domestic investments.
Favorable base effects from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023 played a role in bringing inflation rates down in 2024.
The unification of the exchange rate is crucial, as it facilitates the elimination of foreign exchange backlogs following the closure of the spread between the official and the parallel exchange rate markets.
In the meantime, investment levels continue to be low despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate, which registered 2.50 percent after six quarters of contraction.
On the other hand, the path to global economic recovery remains a function of the efficacy, availability and the rollout speed of vaccines, which could ease the level of uncertainty regarding economic activity over the medium term.
There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as well.
Annual headline urban inflation declined to 3.4 percent in August from 4.2 percent in July 2020, the second lowest rate recorded in almost 14 years, after October 2019’s figure.
Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rates.
Tighter real monetary conditions supported the decline, which accelerated in November due to a favorable base effect.
Annual urban headline inflation increased to record 35.7 percent in June 2023 from 32.7 percent in May 2023.
In addition, labor market data show that the unemployment rate has slightly declined to record 6.7 percent in Q1 2024 from 6.9 percent in Q4 2023.
Globally, economic growth remains broadly stable, albeit slightly below the prePandemic level.
This brings the annual rate to 11.12 percent in September, after it increased to 11.49 percent in August up from 11.04 percent in July, on the back of the favorable base effect from the previous year.
The favorable monthly developments in both headline and core inflation came on the back of declines in several food prices, despite sporadic increases in non‐food prices.
Looking ahead, while the upside risks to the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the broadbased decline in international commodity prices, particularly given the latest global developments, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain a concern.
This month's decline in core CPI coincided with significantly favorable base effects from last year which led the annual rate to drop to 3.84 percent from 5.34 percent in August.
Central Bank of Egypt The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75 percent per annum.
Headline CPI increased by 1.06 percent (m/m) in October compared to 1.57 percent in September, bringing the annual rate to 10.44 percent in October from 10.15 percent in the previous month.
On the other hand, annual headline inflation rates are expected to be affected by unfavorable base effects related to the normalization of monthly inflation rates in 2021, but will continue hovering around the inflation target’s midpoint of 7 percent in 2022.
Leading indicators for 2023 Q3 suggest a general stability in economic activity compared to 2023 Q2.
Headline CPI increased by 0.60 percent (m/m) in April compared to an increase of 0.68 percent (m/m) in March, while the annual rate decreased to 8.87 percent in April down from 9.82 percent recorded in the previous month, on the back of favorable base effect.
Monthly headline urban inflation recorded 0.4 percent in July 2020 compared to 1.8 percent in July 2019, which incorporated the impact of the implemented fiscal consolidation measures to reach cost recovery for fuel products in 2019.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium term.
Real GDP growth was primarily driven by the improvement in tourism, agriculture and trade.
Services have been also only contributing marginally to headline inflation since January 2017, except in May due to higher prices of pilgrimage.
This uncertainty adversely affected emerging markets as risk perceptions started to shift.
Annual headline CPI remained largely unchanged at 11.06 percent in December 2015, despite the slight monthly decline of 0.09 percent (m/m).
The upward trend was driven by unfavorable base effects resulting from the low inflation levels that were recorded in the second half of 2020, as well as higher international commodity prices and various fiscal consolidation measures.
The key elements of the framework include but are not limited to: Narrowing the country’s fiscal deficit to sustainable levels in order to alleviate the pressure on domestic liquidity, avail greater resources to the private sector to increase production, and hence reduce the consequent inflationary pressures from money creation.
Against the above background, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.5 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 13.4 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, which coincided with lower real unit labor costs since 2015.
Exogenous factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy may lead to transitory deviations from previously announced target rates.
Fiscal consolidation measures are expected to lead to oneoff increases in the price level, which translate into temporary higher inflation rates.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate registered 7.3 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 7.4 percent during the preceding quarter.
For the second consecutive month, the negative monthly inflation rate was largely due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables which have been the key drivers of headline inflation since February 2009.
In the meantime, international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to decrease.
Real GDP growth rose slightly to 5.5 percent in 2018 Q4 from 5.3 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent from 10.0 percent, registering its lowest level since 2010 Q4.
While monthly developments in headline inflation have been largely driven by higher prices of several food items since the beginning of 2014, April marks the first month during which food prices have been relatively muted.
A deeper and more protracted global recession than currently projected presents a downside risk to domestic economic growth.
The outlook for global economic growth has increased compared to the June MPC meeting.
The pickup of economic growth was largely boosted by higher net external demand, due to more competitive exchange rates, followed by public domestic demand, which have more than offset lower private domestic demand.
The decline continued to be supported by the containment of inflationary pressures as well as favorable base effects, as monthly inflation recorded 0.7 percent in August 2019 compared to 1.8 percent in August 2018.
Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering thereafter.
However, increasing geopolitical tensions in the region have raised uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, particularly concerning energy prices.
In the meantime, growth was largely driven by consumption, in addition to a positive contribution of investment.
While the fiscal consolidation will improve the fiscal sustainability over the mediumterm, a relative price increase is inevitable.
The direct first round effect of these price adjustments will lead to a level shift up in the headline CPI for July 2014, while the indirect and second round effects could be reflected in both the headline and core inflation rates during the quarter ending September 2014 at varying degrees, which pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
Risks from the global economy are crude oil price developments and the pace of tightening financial conditions.
This, in turn, remains to be a key upside risk to the domestic inflation outlook which is exacerbated by downward price rigidities in domestic markets.
Moreover, some leading indicators point towards a resumption of recovery towards their prepandemic levels.
The spillover to nonfood inflation continued to be strong.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par�cipants since early 2011, investment levels remained low.
This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.61 percent in June compared to 0.65 percent in May, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged recording 8.07 percent in June.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 150 basis points to 14.25 percent, 15.25 percent, and 14.75 percent, respectively.
The latter largely led annual food inflation to register 1.7 percent in May 2021 from negative 0.3 percent in April 2021.
International prices for oil have continued to increase, recording the highest level since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation declined to 1.5 percent in May 2020 from 2.5 percent in April 2020, the lowest rate on record.
Despite the monthly decline, the annual rate increased to 9.55 percent in December from 9.07 percent in the previous month on the back of unfavorable base effects from last year.
Both exceptions reflected a delayed impact of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound on seasonal items.
Against the above and despite sporadic increases in nonfood prices, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained.
It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices prove to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels.
The MPC will continue to monitor the incoming developments underlying the economic outlook.
Nevertheless, upside risks to the predicted inflation path include regional geopolitical tensions, expected volatility in international commodity markets and the state of global financial conditions.
Meanwhile, international oil prices have continued to pick up largely due to supply side developments.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline since August 2017, recording in May 2018 the lowest level since April 2016 at 11.4 and 11.1 percent, respectively.
Incoming data since the May MPC, including the recent inflation outturns, came broadly in line with expectations.
The aforementioned development reflects the sustained pickup of domestic economic activity, as well as the partial impact of a positive base effect.
Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real incomes.
Against this background, the MPC judges that keeping the policy rate unchanged this time is needed to support disinflation.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2 up from 7.7 percent in 2020 Q1.
Consequently, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in FY 2023/24 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering in FY 2024/25.
Annual headline inflation rose to 19.43 percent in November 2016 from 13.56 percent in October 2016, as the monthly rate increased to 4.85 percent in November from 1.70 percent in October.
The witnessed softening in economic growth is attributable to several factors most notably the impact of the RussoUkrainian conflict, as well as the diminishing of the positive base effect observed during the previous three quarters.
Headline CPI increased by 0.15 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 1.31 percent (m/m) in November, bringing the annual rate to 4.66 percent from 4.25 percent in the previous month.
In the labor market, both employment and the labor force figures increased by similar magnitudes, therefore, the unemployment rate remained stable at 7.2 percent in 2022 Q2.
Hence, the deceleration in November 2021 was driven by the lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset the higher annual contribution of nonfood items.
The acceleration in May 2021 was further driven by the higher annual contribution of volatile food items.
The marked slowdown is primarily due to a contraction in gross domestic investments while net exports and consumption were the main drivers of growth in economic activity.
In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up to 6.85 percent in December compared to 6.59 percent in November on the back of the unfavorable base effects from last year and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.
Headline CPI declined by 0.82 percent in November following the 1.37 percent increase in October which led the annual rate to decelerate to 10.19 percent in November from 11.02 percent in October.
However, key central banks are expected to uphold a tight monetary policy stance for an extended period due to uncertainty surrounding the inflation path and upside risks to inflation.
This decision was based on the observed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in construction and manufacturing sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price hike.
Annual headline CPI declined to 10.59 percent in May from 11.38 percent registered in April 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetables.
The reduction of policy rates in today’s and in previous meetings of the MPC provide appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium-term.
While domestic food prices declined, annual headline CPI inflation continued to be high at 20.3 percent in November 2008 compared to 20.2 percent in October driven by the rebound in nonfood inflation.
In the meantime, annual core CPI registered 6.9 percent in February down from the 7.39 percent in January and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.
In its meeting held on December 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
However, the stability of some leading indicators in August and July after signs of improvement in June point to a gradual recovery in economic activity.
This was also reflected in the weakness of international oil prices, despite production cuts by major producers.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 11 percent per annum.
Detailed data for 2023 Q1 portray that economic activity was mainly supported by the positive contributions of consumption and net exports.
This has been evident by relatively tame monthly inflation figures, despite being affected by upward adjustments of regulated prices.
Consequently, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate.
However, the MPC remains concerned about possible propagation of food inflation to nonfood inflation.
Furthermore, the MPC envisages risks related to inflation expectations resulting from elevated annual inflation levels despite the continued moderation of monthly rates.
Favorable base effects have been accelerating the decline of annual inflation rates since November 2017.
In its meeting held on December 14, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates to 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent from 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.
Moreover, elevated broad money growth running above its historical average further contributed to existing inflationary pressures.
Moreover, the impact of the secondround effects on inflation remains to unfold over the coming months.
The past six weeks have witnessed interruptions in economic activity triggered by the domestic political events.
Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase recording 21.3 percent in December 2022.
The headline CPI inflation maintained its upward trend escalating to 19.7% in May as domestic food inflation accelerated sharply to 27% and intensified further by the broadbased regulated price adjustments.
From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
Therefore, in accommodation of the firstround effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafter.
Moreover, geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing maritime trade disruptions continue to raise domestic and global inflationary pressures.
Given the upside risks on the inflation outlook and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that a rate hike is needed.
MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 bps to 18.25 percent, 19.25 percent, and 18.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation declined to 1.9 percent in February 2020 from 2.7 percent in January 2020, the lowest rate on record.
In its meeting held on November 17, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 14.75 percent, 15.75 percent, and 15.25 percent, respectively.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels continued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 11.4 percent in 2011/2012 Q1.
The slight uptick in June 2021 was driven by the higher annual inflation of food items, which accelerated to 3.4 percent in June 2021 from 1.7 percent in May 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of subsidized and core food items.
Domestically, real GDP growth recorded 2.3 percent in Q4 2023, bringing growth in the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2023/24 down to 2.5 percent compared to 4.2 percent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting, but their outlook remains uncertain.
In its meeting held on March 22, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
Additionally, the unemployment rate recorded 9.2 percent in April 2020, compared to 7.7 and 8.0 percent in 2020 Q1 and 2019 Q4, respectively.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices have been revised downwards slightly compared to forecasts underlying the June MPC meeting, while actual spot prices of crude oil have increased.
Annual real GDP growth stabilized in 2018 Q2 at the 5.4 percent rate registered in the previous quarter, which was mainly driven by net foreign demand as well as by domestic investment.
In its meeting held on May 8, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
Monthly developments in headline inflation during 2014 Q1 were largely driven by higher prices of several food items in addition to a seasonal increase in prices of fruits and vegetables.
To this end, the CBE is committed to continue the transition to a flexible inflation targeting regime.
Therefore, the MPC concurs that the current key CBE rates coupled with the increased required reserve ratio are consistent with achieving price stability over the medium term.
Along the near outlook horizon, economic activity is expected to record robust growth figures, driven by domestic demand, which will also be impacted by favorable baseeffects.
Incoming data since the September MPC, including the recent inflation outturns, came broadly in line with expectations.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 8.75%.
In its meeting held on November 27, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent, respectively.
The CBE has decided to launch regular repurchasing agreements (repo) as part of its monetary policy operational framework on every Tuesday starting March 22, 2011.
In November 2020, it reflected a transitory supply shock in tomatoes.
In the meantime, the global financial crisis continues to interrupt the domestic growth momentum, bringing domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q3 to 4.3 percent compared to 7.1 in 2007/08.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation decelerated for the second consecutive month in April 2023 to record 38.6 percent, breaking its upward trend that lasted since mid 2021.
The annual rate continued to ease registering 7.69 percent in December following 7.81 in November.
The headline CPI inflation showed a modest acceleration in June, reaching 20.2% as domestic food inflation was broadly unchanged.
The MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations.
In its monthly meeting held on November 10, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a neutral stance keeping the overnight deposit rate and the overnight lending rates at 9 percent and 11 percent per annum, respectively.
Nonetheless, as inflation is projected to decline significantly over the coming months, the scope to move towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing in order to prevent economic growth from falling below its potential.
The inflation outlook incorporated the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures, that include reaching cost recovery for most fuel products as well as fuel price indexation to underlying costs.
This was also reflected in the unemployment rate which recorded 9.6% in 2020 Q2 up from 7.7% in 2020 Q1.
Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the current moderation in inflation has been driven by improvements in market dynamics, as reflected by the significant decline in annual food inflation to 31.9 percent in June 2024 from a peak of 73.6 percent in September 2023.
Judging by the structure of the banking system’s balance sheet, the share of wholesale funding has been marginal whereas retail deposits correspond to more than two thirds of the banking system’s liabilities.
Annual headline CPI jumped to 11.08 percent in November from 9.70 percent in October, partly on the back of unfavorable base effect from last year, while core inflation increased to 7.44 percent from 6.26 percent in October.
Output remained unfavorably impacted by domestic as well as external factors.
The recent dampening of inflation dynamics generally suggests a normalization to their usual monthly pattern prior to March 2022.
The path for future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 2.0 percent during 2020 Q4, up from 0.7 percent during the previous quarter.
Latest available data in 2019 Q2 showed that private domestic demand outpaced net exports as the main driver of economic activity since the beginning of 2019, driven by the acceleration in private investment growth, which recorded the highest growth in 2018/19 since 2005/06, as well as the gradual recovery in private consumption.
This reflects the impact of the COVID19 outbreak and the accompanying containment measures.
Domestic demand contributed 4.8 percentage points to the 4.5 percent real GDP growth in the first half of 2015/16, while net external demand contributed negative 0.3 percentage points.
Inflation rates benefited from the combined effect of a gradual dissipation of previous shocks supporting a return to normal dynamics; the recent tightening cycle; and a favorable base effect from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023.
MPC decides to keep key policy rates unchanged Cairo, Egypt — In its meeting today, the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 27.25 percent, 28.25 percent, and 27.75 percent, respectively.
Annual headline inflation continued to decline in March and April 2018 to record 13.1 percent, while annual core inflation continued to decline in March to 11.6 percent and remained roughly unchanged in April.
To this end, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) moved to a durably flexible exchange rate regime, leaving the forces of supply and demand to determine the value of the EGP against other foreign currencies, while prioritizing the primary goal of achieving price stability, and building up sustainable, adequate levels of Foreign Exchange Reserves.
The Committee is closely tracking the inflation risks that may arise from possible supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, among other factors.
Inflation is forecasted to hover around current levels until Q4 2024 given the implemented and projected fiscal consolidation measures.
Therefore, it becomes clear that the fundamental requirements for the domestic banking sector to continue to function smoothly are entrenched in the system, lending the necessary support to the economy’s growth momentum going forward.
Consistent with the inflation outlook and the targeted disinflation path, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.79 percent in September compared to a decline of 0.23 percent in August, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged at 5.55 percent, on the back of a favorable base effect from the previous year.
MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 basis points to 21.25 percent, 22.25 percent, and 21.75 percent, respectively.
The Central Bank of Egypt sets its deposit rate at 9.5 % per annum.
f In its meeting held on April 28, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Leading indicators generally suggest a continued improvement of economic activity, despite weaker momentum in nonhydrocarbon sectors.
Accordingly, annual core inflation increased to 2.5 percent in April 2020 from 1.9 percent in March 2020.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation.
The re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.
The latest monthly developments in headline inflation were largely driven by higher prices of several domestic food items on the back of supply bottlenecks in the distribution channels, despite the decline in international food prices, in addition to the effect of Eid festivities.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 14.6 percent in August 2022 from 13.6 percent in July 2022.
Domestically, real GDP growth softened to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 compared to 2.3 percent in Q4 2023.
In preparation for the successful implementation of these measures, sufficient funding has been secured to avail foreign exchange liquidity.
Real GDP growth stabilized at 5.4 percent in 2018 Q2, after rising for six consecutive quarters.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 9.50 percent per annum.
The indicators of real economic activity suggest, on balance, that the recovery continues and that real output growth is now gradually approaching its targeted rate.
Against this background and given the continuation of tightening real monetary conditions, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate at this juncture.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 1.18 percent (m/m) in October following a decline of 0.31 percent (m/m) in September on the back of sporadic increases in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food prices.
Moreover, stable inflation rates are conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth.
Given these developments, annual headline inflation is expected to remain above the MPC’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4.
In accommodation of firstround effects of supplyshocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated before it is targeted to decline to 13% (+/ 3%) by 2018 Q4 and to singledigits thereafter.
Accordingly, the gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations suggest that inflation is on a sustained downward trajectory.
The overall loanstodeposit ratio is around 55 percent, with a high proportion of assets being short term and liquid.
International oil prices recently increased and remain subject to volatility due to potential supplyside factors.
In addition, recently reintroduced COVID19 lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supplychain disruptions.
Additionally, higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017 as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressures.
The structure of economic growth shifted with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser extent.
In its meeting held on August 25, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respec�vely, and the 7day repo at 9.25 percent.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 9 percent per annum.
The discount rate was also raised by 50 bps to 11.5 percent per annum.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.4 percent in 2016/17 Q2, continuing its downward trend after peaking at 13.4 percent in 2013/14 Q2.
Real GDP growth continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter in September 2017 to record 5.2 percent, thereby growing on average by 4.8 percent over the first nine months of 2017 which records the fastest pace since 2010.
The stabilization in the annual headline inflation rate came due to the combined effect of the higher annual contribution of food items, and the lower annual contribution of nonfood items.
This increase is attributed mainly to food items and further supported by nonfood items.
The decline in annual headline urban inflation was driven by lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset slightly higher annual contribution of nonfood items.
During the first three quarters of 2011/2012, real GDP expanded by 1.8 percent on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector which was partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors.
Annual headline inflation continued to decline to record 4.8 percent in September 2019 and 3.1 percent in October 2019, the lowest rate since December 2005.
In the meantime, investment continued to improve for the third consecutive quarter.
Accordingly, monthly core inflation recorded 0.7 percent in October 2017 compared to an average of 0.3 percent in August and September.
The MPC had acted preemptively in its extraordinary meeting on November 3, 2016 by raising the key CBE rates 300 basis points in anticipation of the inflationary pressures.
Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the significant decline in annual food inflation continues to drive down overall inflation and reflects a contained inflationary impact.
Headline CPI increased by 0.84 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 0.73 percent (m/m) in May while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 8.20 percent in June.
Domestically, domestic inflation rates continued to hold at moderate levels.
Upside risks on the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of lower oil prices and the consequent downward revision in international food price forecasts.
Meanwhile, international oil prices declined due to lower demand, yet remain subject to volatility due to potential supplyside factors that include geopolitical risks.
At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.
In its meeting held on November 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent.
The deceleration of inflation implies a return to normal monthly dynamics given the recent tightening cycle, with the receding impact of previous exchange rate and supply shocks.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.25 percent per annum.
On the other hand, annual core CPI declined to 7.23 percent in December from 7.44 percent in November, supported by a favorable base effect from the previous year, despite the slight monthly inch up of nonfood prices.
Based on the targeted reserve money and the inflation outlook assessed in the extraordinary MPC meeting on November 3, 2016, tightening monetary conditions was warranted, and the CBE raised its key policy rates by 300 basis points and absorbed excess liquidity via longerterm deposit auctions.
The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 19.25 percent.
December 6, 2012 In its meeting held on December 6, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices proves to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have been revised upwards compared to the forecasts underlying the previous meeting, mainly due to rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The annual rate declined to 7.10 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last year down from 8.21 percent recorded in September.
While nonfood prices increased by 1.68 percent and 0.36 percent in October and November, respectively, these increases have been largely seasonal, associated with the beginning of the school year in October and Eid festivities in November.
The annual rate increased to 9.65 percent in December from 8.93 percent registered in the previous month, largely led by unfavorable base effects.
Noting these developments, the Central Bank of Egypt reiterates its commitment to safeguard the requisite conditions for sustainable economic development and reaffirms its main mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term.
On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 0.14 percent (m/m) in August after increasing by 1.04 percent in July, bringing the annual rate to 8.97 percent from 9.06 percent recorded in the previous month.
In its meeting held on April 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 10.75 percent, 11.75 percent, and 11.25 percent, respectively.
The gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations since the beginning of the year suggest that inflation remains on a downward trajectory, albeit restrained by the drag of fiscal measures.
Consequently, recent exchange rate dynamics are supporting the tightening of monetary conditions, which will anchor inflation expectations, and dampen the inflation outlook going forward.
Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the previous unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
It is important to underscore that the December inflation outturn is expected to reflect unfavorable base effects from last year, which has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stance.
Moreover, sizable foreign direct investment inflows, substantial improvement in external financing conditions, and their subsequent impact on foreign reserve accumulation, as well as increasing domestic and foreign demand for Egyptian pound denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability.
The annual headline CPI inflation declined to 7.5 percent (y/y) in October and to 6.8 percent in November.
Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium term.
Economic growth in 2021 Q2 was driven by the strong positive contributions of gross domestic investments as well as that of consumption.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 19.25 percent.
Annual headline urban inflation stabilized at 4.5 percent in March and February 2021, after registering 4.3 percent in January 2021.
In the Committee's assessment for the last month, there has been no significant change in the balance of risks to price stability.
The CBE will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to act in order to ensure price stability.
Consequently, upward adjustments in administered prices and increases in the prices of volatile food items have recently widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rates.
Meanwhile, real GDP expanded by a mere 0.4 percent in 2010/2011 Q4 following the significant contrac�on of 4.3 percent recorded the previous quarter.
This was mainly attributed to an increase in employment compared to the previous quarter.
Current policy rates remain in line with achieving single digit inflation as soon as the effects of fiscal consolidation measures dissipate.
In its meeting held on October 29, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
Since the MPC meeting on August 17, 2017, annual headline inflation declined to 31.9 percent from 33.0 percent in July, while monthly headline inflation declined to 1.1 percent from 3.2 percent.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit and discount rate unchanged at 11.5 percent per annum.
Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices primarily due to higher oil prices while food price increases were relatively tame.
The increase was driven by higher prices of core food, retail items and services.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 3.8 percent in 2016/17 Q2 following the 3.4 percent recorded in Q1.
This comes as a result of the moderation of monthly headline inflation rates between August and October 2017 to around 1.1 percent, compared to an average of 1.6 percent in the corresponding months in 2016.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 5.9 percent in April 2020 from 5.1 percent in March 2020 due to a combination of unfavorable base effect stemming from muted price increases in April 2019 as well as higher prices increases in April 2020 which is broadly attributed to the impact of the outbreak of COVID19 as well as a stronger seasonal factor due to Ramadan.
January 16, 2014 In its meeting held January 16, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Elevated global and domestic prices are expected to keep headline inflation above the MPC’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4.
Thereafter, the pickup of economic growth was led by real estate, trade and construction sectors.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline in November 2017 for the fourth consecutive month to record 26.0 percent and 25.5 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.
Inflation in August was mainly driven by an upward adjustment of regulated prices due to higher electricity tariffs, as well as by the increase in prices of fresh vegetables.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10.5 percent per annum.
In addition, inflation remains susceptible to upside risks as key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have exhibited volatility due to supply chain disruptions stemming from geopolitical tensions, and adverse weather conditions.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline to record 8.7 percent and 5.9 percent in July 2019, respectively, the lowest rates in almost four years, notwithstanding the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures that reached cost recovery for most fuel products.
While annual food inflation is still increasing, it is being driven by volatile items as opposed to core food items in earlier months.
Meanwhile, annual nonfood inflation increased slightly for the second consecutive month to 6.3 percent in May 2021 from 6.1 percent in April 2021.
On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have marginally tightened compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting.
Notable factors include the outlook for global supply bottlenecks and global economic activity, especially in light of the reopening in China coupled with the recent financial sector issues in advanced economies.
Amendment to the MPC Schedule The next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday October 5, 2006.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 9 percent per annum.
Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook still outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to further cut the key CBE rates.
Economic activity continued to improve with real GDP growing by a revised 5.0 percent in 2016/17 Q4 and more recent activity indicators solidifying the improvement.
Real GDP growth stabilized around 5.6 percent in 2019 H2 compared to its level in FY2018/19.
This comes after real GDP growth recorded 2.2 percent (y/y) during 2013/14.
Monetary Policy Stance Given the monetary tightening since February, the MPC believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation.
Inflationary pressures continued to recede, as annual headline and core inflation edged downward for the fourth month in a row to reach 27.5 percent and 26.6 percent in June 2024, respectively.
Meanwhile, the annual real GDP growth for 2009/10 Q4 was revised downwards from 5.9 percent to 5.4 percent.
Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments in Europe have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on external demand and investment in Egypt.
Nevertheless, global inflationary pressures began to build after the world economy emerged from the disruptions caused by the COVID19 pandemic.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices continue to be revised downwards compared to those underlying the previous MPC meetings.
Available data indicate that net external demand continued to support economic activity, while private domestic demand remained contained during 2018 Q3.
Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth during November and December came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.65 percent in May compared to 0.23 percent in April, while the annual rate inched up to 8.14 percent in May after registering 7.91 percent in April.
Real GDP growth increased slightly to 5.5 percent in 2018 Q4 from 5.3 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent from 10.0 percent, registering its lowest level since December 2010.
Global inflationary pressures have also eased as a result of a mix of factors, most notably the monetary policy tightening on the part of major central banks, the declining energy prices, and a reduction in global supply bottlenecks.
This decline was supported by favorable base effects and a lower contribution from food prices, while the contribution of nonfood prices remained broadly unchanged.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 15.75 percent, 16.75 percent, and 16.25 percent, respectively.
Looking forward, inflation is expected to moderate further over the coming months.
Annual headline inflation rates were affected by favorable and then unfavorable base effects during April and May 2021, reflecting the early impact of the outbreak of COVID19 and its related containment measures on inflation readings during 2020.
Consequently, the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions are warranted in commitment to its pricestability mandate.
This comes after headline inflation declined to 12.0 percent in December 2018 due to the reversal of the transitory supply shock related to select vegetables.
The declining trend in international food prices suggest that the international food price shock might be waning.
Preliminary figures for 2023 Q1 portray that economic activity is mainly supported by the positive contributions of tourism, agriculture and construction.
In the meantime, international prices for commodities such as food and select minerals have continued to increase but at a slower rate.
These monthly developments were largely driven by bottlenecks in the distribution channels of butane gas cylinders, along with tame price increases in some food items that were outweighed by declines in others.
In light of the upcoming 2006 World Bank/International Monetary Fund Annual Meetings held in Singapore between September 11 and 20, the MPC meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday October 5 instead of Thursday September 21.
Domestically, real GDP growth moderated to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter, mainly reflecting negative spillovers from geopolitical tensions and maritime trade disruptions to the services sector.
Meanwhile, real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 5.7 percent in 2019 Q2, compared to 5.6 percent in the previous quarter, leading to an estimated growth rate of 5.6 percent for the fiscal year 2018/19, the highest since the fiscal year 2007/08.
Meanwhile, partially offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual nonfood inflation to 4.9 percent in September 2021 from 5.3 percent in August 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since December 2012.
Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline reaching an 18month low of 9.9 percent in June 2009, compared to 10.2 percent in May, down from the 23.6 percent peak recorded in August 2008.
The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the mediumterm.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation target.
On a sectoral level, tourism, nonpetroleum manufacturing and natural gas extractions contributed most towards growth in economic activity with private sector activity remaining the main contributor towards overall GDP growth.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 9 percent per annum.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2011/2012 Q3, following feeble average growth rates of 0.35 percent in the first two quarters.
Meanwhile, the annual rate declined from 7.6 percent in October to 7.0 percent in November and December supported by favorable base effects from last year.
In their deliberations during the MPC meeting on October 4, the members decided not to raise interest rates, however, with the sentiment to review this decision in its next meeting.
In addition to oil price developments, risks from the external economy continue to include the pace of tightening financial conditions.
While these shocks have flattened the disinflation path, they do not characterize the underlying inflationary pressures.
The decline of annual food inflation was mostly driven by fresh vegetables.
The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growth.
Moreover, the MPC is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressures which continue to tilt the balance of risks to the upside.
Moreover, there are concerns related to the global recovery on the back of renewed worries regarding fiscal challenges facing the Euro Area.
Incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, notwithstanding the expected impact of unfavorable base effects on near-term inflation rates due to the reversal of the transitory shock to prices of fresh vegetables in the previous year.
Job creation supported the decline of the unemployment rate to 9.9 percent in 2018 Q2, the lowest rate since 2010 Q4.
Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, albeit recovering and beginning to set the stage for monetary policy normalization.
The headline and core annual rates thereby registered in April 2018 the lowest since May and April 2016, respectively.
The Banking System The Egyptian banking system continues to be relatively isolated from the global turbulence as domestic banks have very limited exposure to the failed and stressed global financial institutions.
Recent inflation dynamics since the Special MPC on March 6, 2024 serve as an early indication of monthly dynamics normalizing to their usual pattern prior to March 2022.
The discount rate was unchanged.
Against this background and in light of previous monetary policy actions, the MPC decided to keep the key policy rates unchanged.
And because the path for current policy rates remains a function of mediumterm inflation expectations rather than current inflation outturns, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 50 basis points.
Core inflation rose to 12.37 percent in June 2016 from 12.23 percent in May 2016, while the monthonmonth rate dropped to 0.74 percent in June from 3.15 percent in May.
Meanwhile, annual food inflation remained stable after contributing to the decline in January 2021, in light of the continued reversal of the transitory shock in tomato prices.
However, annual broad money growth has also increased excluding revaluation effects due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation, as well as higher loans to the private sector in domestic currency.
The annual headline CPI inflation inchedup to 8.45 percent (y/y) in August compared to 8 percent in July.
On the other hand, core CPI remained unchanged in May compared to 0.97 percent increase in April.
In its meeting held on June 11, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
The softening is driven by declining public contribution to economic activity due to the impact of Red Sea maritime trade disruption on the service sector.
The MPC emphasizes that anchoring inflation expectations is critical and warrants this policy response to bring the real interest rate into positive territory.
Going forward, economic activity will continue to expand albeit at a slowerthan previously projected pace, partially due to the unfavorable spillovers of international developments emanating from the RussoUkrainian war.
Domestic demand came largely due to consumption expenditure, while the contribution of investment expenditure was weak.
Egypt’s GDP growth is expected to recover albeit gradually, with structural measures expected to support economic activity.
Economic activity remained sluggish in 2012/2013 on the back of weak growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing, construction and tourism, in addition to the contraction in the petroleum sector.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 4.3 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q2 to record 5.6 percent (y/y) in the first half of the fiscal year, supported by the record growth witnessed in the first quarter.
Annual broad money (M2) growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components, recording 39.4 percent in May 2017.
These recent developments necessitate additional tightening in the monetary stance, not only to contain demand side pressures as mentioned above, but also to avoid broad and persistent inflationary effects that could emanate from the supply shocks, with the aim of anchoring inflation expectations.
Annual food inflation increased in March 2021 after remaining stable in February 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of volatile food items as well as core food items, but by a lesser extent, in line with their seasonal patterns.
