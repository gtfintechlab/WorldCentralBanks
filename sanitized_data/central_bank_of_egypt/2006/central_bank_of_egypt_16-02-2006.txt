The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.25 percent per annum. In its monthly meeting held on February 16, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 8.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respectively. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the mediumterm.
