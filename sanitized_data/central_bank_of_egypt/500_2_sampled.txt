The annual rate eased to 9.15 percent in September, after it increased to 10.07 percent in August up from 9.57 percent in July, also due to the favorable base effect from the previous year.
The expansion of global economic activity weakened, and the tightening of financial conditions eased, while trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outlook.
Annual headline urban inflation declined in October and November 2021, to record 6.3 percent and 5.6 percent from 6.6 percent in September 2021, respectively.
Concurrently, international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to increase.
Inflation readings are expected to continue to be affected by unfavorable base effects in the near term.
In its meeting held on July 6, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 200 basis points to 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
This was partially supported by the robust growth in tourism, construction and manufacturing, as well as a positive base effect emanating from the low growth rates in the same period in 2020, resulting from the COVID19 containment measures.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 12.25 percent.
Furthermore, the Committee will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook.
The bulk of the monthly increase occurred due to core items, particularly food and retail, which came in addition to higher regulated prices.
The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 18.25 percent.
In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par�cipants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private sector.
Furthermore, the MPC has noticed that in addition to manufacturing and construction, other sectors have started to record higher growth rates that may precipitate more inflationary pressures.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.44 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 0.25 percent (m/m) in November on the back of sporadic movements in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food prices.
It is important to underscore that the pick up in international food prices since late 2010 have had limited spillover effects on domestic food prices.
The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were driven by increases in several food prices combined with a number of non‐food prices.
Annual headline CPI inflation increased to 10.8 percent in September 2009, compared to 9 percent in August.
Furthermore, leading indicators point towards a sustained improvement across most sectors.
The MPC continues to assess the impact of the frontloaded tightening policies in a datadriven manner, with recent inflation developments showing higher broadbased inflation across CPI items.
Leading indicators for 2023 Q1 point towards a slowdown of real GDP growth.
The inflation outlook remains in line with achieving the inflation target.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stabilized at 7.5 percent in 2021 Q3, compared to 7.3 percent during the preceding quarter.
In its meeting held on August 16, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
September 16, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
The government has revised up the prices of several regulated items within the CPI basket including fuel, electricity, and tobacco as part of the 2014/2015 fiscal consolidation plan.
However, the COVID19 outbreak as well as the associated containment measures induce a considerable disruption to economic activity and financial markets globally.
This comes as negative annual food inflation eased for the second consecutive month.
The MPC judges that interest rate increases are highly likely at this juncture.
Accordingly, the annual rate decelerated to 11.39 percent in June from 13.11 percent in May, supported partially by the favorable base effect from the previous year.
This remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions; a necessary requirement to achieve the inflation target of 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
The witnessed strong dynamics reflect the combined effect of several factors.
The overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates were kept at 9.5 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the considerable decline in domestic food inflation.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.5 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 13.4 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, supported by lower real unit labor costs relative to productivity.
Globally, the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outlook.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3, up from 1.7% during 2020 Q2.
In its meeting held on July 29, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively.
However, economic activity is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously projected, given the uncertainty and negative spillovers from the global scene.
In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of net exports.
Output growth by economic activity was relatively diversified, and continued to be mostly supplied by the private sector.
While the immediate oneoff effect would be reflected in the next inflation reading, the consequent second round effects of these price adjustments pose an upside risk to the inflation prospects.
Moreover, the passthrough to domestic inflation from global financial market developments remained contained due to domestic policy measures that support improving macroeconomic fundamentals.
For the third consecutive month, the increase in food inflation came due to higher prices of volatile food items as opposed to core food items in earlier months.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.75 percent.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by25 basis points to 8.75 percent per annum.
MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 18.25 percent, 19.25 percent, and 18.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation recorded 2.4 percent in December 2019 compared to 2.1 percent in November 2019, mainly due to higher poultry prices.
Looking ahead, upside risks to the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of broadbased declines in international commodity prices.
In addition, forecasts for headline inflation in key global economies have been revised downwards compared to the June MPC meeting, despite remaining above their respective target levels.
Meanwhile, annual nonfood inflation declined, supported by broadly stable prices in March 2021 as well as favorable base effects.
The MPC is watching these developments and is weighing the possible effects of the above on inflation in the near future.
Updated leading indicators for Q2 2024 indicate that real GDP growth has started to pick up and is expected to gradually recover as of fiscal year 2024/25, following a marked slowdown in fiscal year 2023/24.
Meanwhile, annual headline inflation registered 31.46 percent.
In the meantime, annual core inflation increased only slightly to 4.0 percent in November 2020 from 3.9 percent in October 2020.
Meanwhile, global financial conditions have tightened, as major central banks have continued to both tighten policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary concerns in their respective countries.
In addition, financial conditions broadly stabilized, with several central banks indicating that their inflation may have peaked and potentially started its deceleration path.
Moreover, the annual inflation of services was mainly driven by expenditure on restaurants and cafes, while the increase in retail items was broadbased.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.97 percent (m/m) in April compared to 0.51 percent (m/m) in March, bringing the annual rate to 7.47 percent in April from 7.03 percent in March.
In light of the above, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 200 bps and reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates.
Meanwhile, a number of leading indicators started showing signs of recovery in June and July 2020, in tandem with the easing of the containment measures.
The annual headline CPI inflation eased further in May 2007, recording 10 percent (y/y) compared to 12.8 percent (y/y) in March 2007.
The main contributors to growth during 2014/15 Q3 were the internal trade, construction, building and the real estate sectors, while the extractions sector remained weak.
Upside risks from imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower international food price forecasts in light of global developments.
Meanwhile, real GDP picked up significantly in 2013/2014 Q4, growing by 3.70 percent compared to 2.50 percent, 1.44 percent and 1.04 percent recorded in Q3, Q2 and Q1, respectively.
The MPC will continue to follow a datadriven approach to determine the sufficient level and duration of restriction based on its assessment of the inflation outlook, dynamics of underlying inflation, and strength of monetary policy transmission.
Fruits and vegetables continued to be the determining factor in the headline inflation outturn, contributing by 1.1 percentage points to the monthly increase of 1.8 percentage points recorded in September 2009.
Nevertheless, given elevated monthly inflation rates, annual headline and core inflation registered 30.25 percent and 33.10 percent in February 2017, respectively.
June 17, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate.
February 15,2018 In its meeting held on February 15, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 100 basis points to 17.75 percent, 18.75 percent, and 18.25 percent, respectively.
Employment rose, contributing favorably to the continued decline of the unemployment rate to 7.5 percent in 2019 Q2, thereby narrowing by almost 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013 Q4.
As expected, annual headline inflation reversed its upward trend and decelerated in both October and November 2023 due to favourable base effects; to record 34.6 percent in November 2023 down from 35.8 percent in October 2023.
In the meantime, core CPI declined by 0.23 percent in August compared to an increase of 0.30 in July, leading the annual rate to drop to 5.61 percent in August from 6.49 percent in July.
Yet, ongoing uncertainties surrounding the projected slowdown of external demand pose downside risks to domestic economic growth.
The Ramadan effect exacerbated the impact of supply shortages in red meat and poultry witnessed since early 2010, which caused a surge in their prices during the past two months.
In addition, supply factors, chiefly the outbreak of Avian flu as well as administered price adjustments, most importantly the July fuel price hike, have had varying degrees of initial costpush effects on inflation and the second round effects are becoming evident.
This development has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stance.
Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook include the evolution of inflation expectations, the timing and magnitude of potential subsidyreform measures, as well as demandside pressures.
Incoming information since the MPC last met were broadly as expected, accordingly, the MPC judges that current policy rates remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
By sector, the services sector was the highest contributor to economic growth, particularly construction and real estate, while tourism contributed negatively.
To that end, the CBE will begin the process of gradually repealing Letter No.
Moreover, broad money growth is strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
In the meantime while prices of fresh vegetables inchedup, prices of other food items continued to decelerate supported by the decline in international prices, notwithstanding the seasonal pickup in September due to Eid AlAdha.
Against this backdrop, Egypt is intent on intensifying its reform agenda to secure macroeconomic stability and achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Annual headline CPI inflation dropped to 14.3 percent in January 2009 compared to 20.3 percent and 18.3 percent in November and December 2008, respectively.
Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the mediumterm.
October 18, 2012 In its meeting held on October 18, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi�ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respec�vely, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
Real GDP growth at market prices increased in 2020 Q4 to record a preliminary figure of 2.0 percent, up from 0.7 percent during 2020 Q3 and a contraction of 1.7 percent during 2020 Q2.
Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy given the latest global market developments could pose downside risks to domestic GDP.
Accordingly, higher annual non-food inflation led annual core inflation to increase slightly to 2.7 percent in October 2019 from 2.6 percent in September 2019, the lowest rate since April 2006.
The slower growth rates witnessed in the manufacturing sector, in addition to the contraction in Suez Canal activity and exports, have led to the evident retreat in domestic economic growth.
The MPC judges that demand side pressures have recently increased, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity, higher broadbased inflation outturns, and higher broad money growth.
This decision was based on an assessment of recent domestic and external economic developments since the last MPC meeting.
Going forward, the dire prospects for global growth in 2009 are likely to exert further downward pressures on external demand with unfavorable repercussions on the domestic growth outlook.
Meanwhile, slightly offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual nonfood inflation to 5.3 percent in August 2021 from 5.7 percent in July 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since April 2014.
While economic growth is broadly stable, the outlook remains subject to downside risks due to the dampening effect of monetary tightening on economic activity.
Given the increases in core items, annual core inflation rose to 30.86 percent in January 2017 due to average monthly inflation of 4.89 percent between November 2016 and January 2017 .
Meanwhile, international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risks.
In addition, annual core inflation continued to decelerate for the fifth consecutive month, recording 35.9 percent in November 2023, down from 38.1 percent in October 2023.
The effects on the Egyptian banking sector, however, have been minimal in light of prudent regulations and comfortable domestic liquidity conditions.
Meanwhile, core inflation declined to 7.9 percent in November 2018 from 8.9 percent in October 2018, recording the lowest rate since February 2016.
Despite tentative signs of moderation in international wheat prices, the domestic inflation outlook is affected by the latest regulated price adjustments.
The preemptive tightening policy response aims to anchor inflation expectations at the upcoming inflation target of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4.
From the monetary perspective, broad and reserve money growth are likely to be impacted going forward by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit as well as relatively higher foreign reserves accumulation.
Meanwhile, unemployment rate recorded 7.8 percent in 2019 Q3 compared to 7.5 percent in 2019 Q2, the lowest level on record.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent.
Incoming data since the November MPC, including the recent inflation dynamics, came broadly in line with expectations.
Excluding revaluation effects, annual broad money growth increased to 22.1 percent in May 2017, mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets as well as higher loans to the private sector, while the contribution of net claims on the government eased given higher net external and nonbank financing.
Nevertheless, employment continued to recover for the third consecutive quarter.
During October 2017, annual headline and core inflation declined for the third consecutive month to record 30.8 percent and 30.5 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 16.75 percent.
Annual headline urban inflation accelerated for the third consecutive month to 5.7 percent in November 2020 from 4.5 percent in October 2020.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation continued to be supported by favorable base effects since March 2017, dropping to 30.6 percent in May from 33.1 percent in February.
Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID19 pandemic, although growth remains uneven across regions, as the pace of vaccinations varies across countries.
It continued its upward trend to record 13.3 percent in May 2022 from 11.9 percent in the previous month.
While the supply shortages related to fruits and vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have largely eased during the past three months, their price increases since the beginning of 2010 continue to explain more than 40 percent of annual headline inflation.
From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 7.2 percent.
Domestic Inflation and Economic Growth For the first time since November 2007, annual headline CPI inflation declined to 21.5% in September compared to 23.6% in August, as domestic food inflation has fallen from 31% to 25.6%.
The annual rate declined to 9.75 percent from 10.28 percent in July due to a favorable base effect.
The latest data available reveals that real GDP grew robustly by 4.2 percent in 2014/15 after recording 2.2 percent (y/y) growth in 2013/14.
In its meeting held on May 10, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
In the meantime, domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q2 softened, declining to 4.1 percent compared to 5.8 percent in the previous quarter and 7.1 in 2007/08, chiefly a consequence of the continuing global economic slowdown.
The annual inflation rates continued to be affected by persistent supply shocks, which fed through higher underlying pressures.
Globally, economic activity remained subdued despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policymeasures despite the ongoing uncertainty.
The drop was mainly driven by consumption, while the contribution of gross fixed investment held steady as the increase in private investment offset the decline in public investment.
In its last meeting on February 15, 2018 the MPC began to ease its tight stance on interest rates that successfully managed to tame monthly inflation.
Central Bank of Egypt The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9 percent per annum.
Moreover, the unemployment rate decreased to 7.3 percent in 2020 Q3, down from 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2.
Real GDP growth had stabilized around 5.6 percent in 2019 H2, which was the same level recorded in FY2018/19.
The discount rate was also raised by 300 basis points to 16.75 percent.
Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sectors.
Headline CPI increased by 1.20 percent (m/m) in July following the 0.42 percent in June, while the annual rate declined from 11.79 percent to 10.36 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last year.
Furthermore, the committee will not hesitate to utilize all its available tools to attain a tight policy stance and calibrate liquidity conditions accordingly.
In the meantime, core CPI increased by 1.79 percent (m/m) in July compared to 0.68 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate increased to 9.57 percent in July compared to 8.76 percent in June and was partially limited by a favorable base effect from the previous year.
Egypt’s reform program has placed the economy on a strong footing to weather economic disruptions as they emerge.
Headline inflation registered 1.69 percent (m/m) in April 2017, recording its third consecutive decline due to fading costpush pressures after averaging 4.01 percent (m/m) between November 2016 and January 2017.
Real GDP growth continued to increase for the third consecutive quarter to record 5.0 percent at market prices in 2016/17 Q4, thereby averaging 4.6 percent in the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/2010.
This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, registering the lowest rate since 2011/12.
Globally, economic activity remains subdued despite the accommodative financial conditions, as the outbreak of the second wave of COVID19 pandemic and its related lockdown measures weigh on the nearterm outlook.
Moreover, increases in the prices of inland transportation, fresh vegetables & fruits and other food items can be partly attributed to the indirect effects of the regulated price adjustments as well as the seasonal effect of Ramadan.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10 percent per annum.
Rising international commodity prices resulting from further supply chain disruptions in addition to increased riskoff sentiment have added to domestic inflationary pressures as well as external imbalances.
This rebound was largely driven by a significant favorable base effect from the respective quarter of 2010/2011 during which economic activity was interrupted following the unfolding political events.
Preliminary figures announced recently show that real GDP growth for FY19/20 recorded 3.5 percent, down from 5.6 percent in the previous fiscal year.
The MPC continues to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated deviations from the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.
The decline was further affected by the release of the 10th CPI series as well as its linking methodology with the 9th CPI series.
In its meeting held on September 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
The annual rate accelerated to 13.19 percent in May from 10.96 percent in April, partly due to the unfavorable base effect from last year.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 9.75 percent.
In view of the above, and the previous MPC decisions to raise key policy rates by a cumulative 800 basis points in Q1 2024, the Committee judges that the current monetary stance remains appropriate to place inflation on a declining trend, and will continue to assess its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.
However, risks to the disinflation path are tilted to the upside given tighter global oil supplies, escalation of regional geopolitical tensions, uncertainty regarding the adoption of protectionist trade policies, and higher than anticipated passthrough of fiscal measures.
Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to be impacted by transitory costpush factors stemming from the economic reform measures before beginning to narrow.
Consequently, Egypt weathered large capital outflows and rising commodity prices.
While these monthly rates are exceptionally high, they have been mainly driven by higher prices of a number of food items, which had witnessed seasonal increases of varying degrees in July and August ahead of and during the month of Ramadan.
In accordance with the CBE’s resolve to achieve price stability over the medium term and in line with the preannounced disinflation target path, the MPC has set its upcoming inflation targets at 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.
Widespread inflationary pressures remain elevated, continuing to impact pricing and consumption behaviours.
Moving forward, the MPC will keep monitoring the global and domestic conditions for further developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium term.
Domestically, real GDP growth registered 2.7 percent in 2023 Q3 compared to 2.9 percent in the previous quarter.
The annual rate increased to 9.90 percent in March up from 9.70 in February.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.76 percent in March compared to 1.10 percent in February, while the annual rate inched up to 7.21 percent in March after registering 7.15 percent in February.
The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 11.75 percent.
The MPC will continue to monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance in line with its price stability mandate.
Moreover, while the prices of food items decelerated in August, there was a seasonal pick up in September which coincided with Eid ElAdha.
The latter, however, were mostly confined to seasonal items associated with Haj season and the beginning of the school year.
Headline CPI increased by 1.69 percent in September after accelerating by 2.85 percent in August, while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 10.97 percent in September.
The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 10 percent per annum.
In its meeting held on February 12, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates by 100 bps to 10.5 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
In its monthly meeting, held today on Thursday, July 7, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged.
While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous statements continue to exist, a detailed assessment of the most recent inflation figures may suggest a tentative moderation.
Annual headline urban inflation inched up to 4.5 percent in February 2021 from 4.3 percent in January 2021, after having decelerated from 5.4 percent in December 2020.
Moreover, the recent uptick in private economic activity was not sufficient to offset the decline in public economic activity.
In light of the above developments and given the CBE’s monetary policy horizon of its inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 100 basis points to reign in inflationary pressures while supporting economic activity.
The MPC believes that such a flexible monetary targeting framework is appropriate under the liberalized exchange rate regime.
Real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter, to record 5.3 percent in December 2017 and an average of 5.0 percent during 2017, the highest since 2010.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate.
Over the nearterm, domestic economic activity is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand, and in specific, gross domestic investments.
Favorable base effects from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023 played a role in bringing inflation rates down in 2024.
The unification of the exchange rate is crucial, as it facilitates the elimination of foreign exchange backlogs following the closure of the spread between the official and the parallel exchange rate markets.
In the meantime, investment levels continue to be low despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate, which registered 2.50 percent after six quarters of contraction.
On the other hand, the path to global economic recovery remains a function of the efficacy, availability and the rollout speed of vaccines, which could ease the level of uncertainty regarding economic activity over the medium term.
There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as well.
Annual headline urban inflation declined to 3.4 percent in August from 4.2 percent in July 2020, the second lowest rate recorded in almost 14 years, after October 2019’s figure.
Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rates.
Tighter real monetary conditions supported the decline, which accelerated in November due to a favorable base effect.
Annual urban headline inflation increased to record 35.7 percent in June 2023 from 32.7 percent in May 2023.
In addition, labor market data show that the unemployment rate has slightly declined to record 6.7 percent in Q1 2024 from 6.9 percent in Q4 2023.
Globally, economic growth remains broadly stable, albeit slightly below the prePandemic level.
This brings the annual rate to 11.12 percent in September, after it increased to 11.49 percent in August up from 11.04 percent in July, on the back of the favorable base effect from the previous year.
The favorable monthly developments in both headline and core inflation came on the back of declines in several food prices, despite sporadic increases in non‐food prices.
Looking ahead, while the upside risks to the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the broadbased decline in international commodity prices, particularly given the latest global developments, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain a concern.
This month's decline in core CPI coincided with significantly favorable base effects from last year which led the annual rate to drop to 3.84 percent from 5.34 percent in August.
Central Bank of Egypt The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.75 percent per annum.
Headline CPI increased by 1.06 percent (m/m) in October compared to 1.57 percent in September, bringing the annual rate to 10.44 percent in October from 10.15 percent in the previous month.
On the other hand, annual headline inflation rates are expected to be affected by unfavorable base effects related to the normalization of monthly inflation rates in 2021, but will continue hovering around the inflation target’s midpoint of 7 percent in 2022.
Leading indicators for 2023 Q3 suggest a general stability in economic activity compared to 2023 Q2.
Headline CPI increased by 0.60 percent (m/m) in April compared to an increase of 0.68 percent (m/m) in March, while the annual rate decreased to 8.87 percent in April down from 9.82 percent recorded in the previous month, on the back of favorable base effect.
Monthly headline urban inflation recorded 0.4 percent in July 2020 compared to 1.8 percent in July 2019, which incorporated the impact of the implemented fiscal consolidation measures to reach cost recovery for fuel products in 2019.
The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium term.
Real GDP growth was primarily driven by the improvement in tourism, agriculture and trade.
Services have been also only contributing marginally to headline inflation since January 2017, except in May due to higher prices of pilgrimage.
This uncertainty adversely affected emerging markets as risk perceptions started to shift.
Annual headline CPI remained largely unchanged at 11.06 percent in December 2015, despite the slight monthly decline of 0.09 percent (m/m).
The upward trend was driven by unfavorable base effects resulting from the low inflation levels that were recorded in the second half of 2020, as well as higher international commodity prices and various fiscal consolidation measures.
The key elements of the framework include but are not limited to: Narrowing the country’s fiscal deficit to sustainable levels in order to alleviate the pressure on domestic liquidity, avail greater resources to the private sector to increase production, and hence reduce the consequent inflationary pressures from money creation.
Against the above background, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.5 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 13.4 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, which coincided with lower real unit labor costs since 2015.
Exogenous factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy may lead to transitory deviations from previously announced target rates.
Fiscal consolidation measures are expected to lead to oneoff increases in the price level, which translate into temporary higher inflation rates.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate registered 7.3 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 7.4 percent during the preceding quarter.
For the second consecutive month, the negative monthly inflation rate was largely due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables which have been the key drivers of headline inflation since February 2009.
In the meantime, international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to decrease.
Real GDP growth rose slightly to 5.5 percent in 2018 Q4 from 5.3 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent from 10.0 percent, registering its lowest level since 2010 Q4.
While monthly developments in headline inflation have been largely driven by higher prices of several food items since the beginning of 2014, April marks the first month during which food prices have been relatively muted.
A deeper and more protracted global recession than currently projected presents a downside risk to domestic economic growth.
The outlook for global economic growth has increased compared to the June MPC meeting.
The pickup of economic growth was largely boosted by higher net external demand, due to more competitive exchange rates, followed by public domestic demand, which have more than offset lower private domestic demand.
The decline continued to be supported by the containment of inflationary pressures as well as favorable base effects, as monthly inflation recorded 0.7 percent in August 2019 compared to 1.8 percent in August 2018.
Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering thereafter.
However, increasing geopolitical tensions in the region have raised uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, particularly concerning energy prices.
In the meantime, growth was largely driven by consumption, in addition to a positive contribution of investment.
While the fiscal consolidation will improve the fiscal sustainability over the mediumterm, a relative price increase is inevitable.
The direct first round effect of these price adjustments will lead to a level shift up in the headline CPI for July 2014, while the indirect and second round effects could be reflected in both the headline and core inflation rates during the quarter ending September 2014 at varying degrees, which pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐term.
Risks from the global economy are crude oil price developments and the pace of tightening financial conditions.
This, in turn, remains to be a key upside risk to the domestic inflation outlook which is exacerbated by downward price rigidities in domestic markets.
Moreover, some leading indicators point towards a resumption of recovery towards their prepandemic levels.
The spillover to nonfood inflation continued to be strong.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par�cipants since early 2011, investment levels remained low.
This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.61 percent in June compared to 0.65 percent in May, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged recording 8.07 percent in June.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 150 basis points to 14.25 percent, 15.25 percent, and 14.75 percent, respectively.
The latter largely led annual food inflation to register 1.7 percent in May 2021 from negative 0.3 percent in April 2021.
International prices for oil have continued to increase, recording the highest level since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation declined to 1.5 percent in May 2020 from 2.5 percent in April 2020, the lowest rate on record.
Despite the monthly decline, the annual rate increased to 9.55 percent in December from 9.07 percent in the previous month on the back of unfavorable base effects from last year.
Both exceptions reflected a delayed impact of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound on seasonal items.
Against the above and despite sporadic increases in nonfood prices, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain contained.
It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices prove to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels.
The MPC will continue to monitor the incoming developments underlying the economic outlook.
Nevertheless, upside risks to the predicted inflation path include regional geopolitical tensions, expected volatility in international commodity markets and the state of global financial conditions.
Meanwhile, international oil prices have continued to pick up largely due to supply side developments.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline since August 2017, recording in May 2018 the lowest level since April 2016 at 11.4 and 11.1 percent, respectively.
Incoming data since the May MPC, including the recent inflation outturns, came broadly in line with expectations.
The aforementioned development reflects the sustained pickup of domestic economic activity, as well as the partial impact of a positive base effect.
Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real incomes.
Against this background, the MPC judges that keeping the policy rate unchanged this time is needed to support disinflation.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 9.6 percent in 2020 Q2 up from 7.7 percent in 2020 Q1.
Consequently, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in FY 2023/24 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering in FY 2024/25.
Annual headline inflation rose to 19.43 percent in November 2016 from 13.56 percent in October 2016, as the monthly rate increased to 4.85 percent in November from 1.70 percent in October.
The witnessed softening in economic growth is attributable to several factors most notably the impact of the RussoUkrainian conflict, as well as the diminishing of the positive base effect observed during the previous three quarters.
Headline CPI increased by 0.15 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 1.31 percent (m/m) in November, bringing the annual rate to 4.66 percent from 4.25 percent in the previous month.
In the labor market, both employment and the labor force figures increased by similar magnitudes, therefore, the unemployment rate remained stable at 7.2 percent in 2022 Q2.
Hence, the deceleration in November 2021 was driven by the lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset the higher annual contribution of nonfood items.
The acceleration in May 2021 was further driven by the higher annual contribution of volatile food items.
The marked slowdown is primarily due to a contraction in gross domestic investments while net exports and consumption were the main drivers of growth in economic activity.
In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up to 6.85 percent in December compared to 6.59 percent in November on the back of the unfavorable base effects from last year and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.
Headline CPI declined by 0.82 percent in November following the 1.37 percent increase in October which led the annual rate to decelerate to 10.19 percent in November from 11.02 percent in October.
However, key central banks are expected to uphold a tight monetary policy stance for an extended period due to uncertainty surrounding the inflation path and upside risks to inflation.
This decision was based on the observed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in construction and manufacturing sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price hike.
Annual headline CPI declined to 10.59 percent in May from 11.38 percent registered in April 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetables.
The reduction of policy rates in today’s and in previous meetings of the MPC provide appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium-term.
While domestic food prices declined, annual headline CPI inflation continued to be high at 20.3 percent in November 2008 compared to 20.2 percent in October driven by the rebound in nonfood inflation.
In the meantime, annual core CPI registered 6.9 percent in February down from the 7.39 percent in January and remains within the CBE's comfort zone.
In its meeting held on December 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.
However, the stability of some leading indicators in August and July after signs of improvement in June point to a gradual recovery in economic activity.
This was also reflected in the weakness of international oil prices, despite production cuts by major producers.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 11 percent per annum.
Detailed data for 2023 Q1 portray that economic activity was mainly supported by the positive contributions of consumption and net exports.
This has been evident by relatively tame monthly inflation figures, despite being affected by upward adjustments of regulated prices.
Consequently, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate.
However, the MPC remains concerned about possible propagation of food inflation to nonfood inflation.
Furthermore, the MPC envisages risks related to inflation expectations resulting from elevated annual inflation levels despite the continued moderation of monthly rates.
Favorable base effects have been accelerating the decline of annual inflation rates since November 2017.
In its meeting held on December 14, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates to 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent from 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.
Moreover, elevated broad money growth running above its historical average further contributed to existing inflationary pressures.
Moreover, the impact of the secondround effects on inflation remains to unfold over the coming months.
The past six weeks have witnessed interruptions in economic activity triggered by the domestic political events.
Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase recording 21.3 percent in December 2022.
The headline CPI inflation maintained its upward trend escalating to 19.7% in May as domestic food inflation accelerated sharply to 27% and intensified further by the broadbased regulated price adjustments.
From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.
Therefore, in accommodation of the firstround effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafter.
Moreover, geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing maritime trade disruptions continue to raise domestic and global inflationary pressures.
Given the upside risks on the inflation outlook and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that a rate hike is needed.
MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 bps to 18.25 percent, 19.25 percent, and 18.75 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation declined to 1.9 percent in February 2020 from 2.7 percent in January 2020, the lowest rate on record.
In its meeting held on November 17, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 14.75 percent, 15.75 percent, and 15.25 percent, respectively.
In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels continued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 11.4 percent in 2011/2012 Q1.
The slight uptick in June 2021 was driven by the higher annual inflation of food items, which accelerated to 3.4 percent in June 2021 from 1.7 percent in May 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of subsidized and core food items.
Domestically, real GDP growth recorded 2.3 percent in Q4 2023, bringing growth in the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2023/24 down to 2.5 percent compared to 4.2 percent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting, but their outlook remains uncertain.
In its meeting held on March 22, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
Additionally, the unemployment rate recorded 9.2 percent in April 2020, compared to 7.7 and 8.0 percent in 2020 Q1 and 2019 Q4, respectively.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices have been revised downwards slightly compared to forecasts underlying the June MPC meeting, while actual spot prices of crude oil have increased.
Annual real GDP growth stabilized in 2018 Q2 at the 5.4 percent rate registered in the previous quarter, which was mainly driven by net foreign demand as well as by domestic investment.
In its meeting held on May 8, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
Monthly developments in headline inflation during 2014 Q1 were largely driven by higher prices of several food items in addition to a seasonal increase in prices of fruits and vegetables.
To this end, the CBE is committed to continue the transition to a flexible inflation targeting regime.
Therefore, the MPC concurs that the current key CBE rates coupled with the increased required reserve ratio are consistent with achieving price stability over the medium term.
Along the near outlook horizon, economic activity is expected to record robust growth figures, driven by domestic demand, which will also be impacted by favorable baseeffects.
Incoming data since the September MPC, including the recent inflation outturns, came broadly in line with expectations.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 8.75%.
In its meeting held on November 27, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 9.25 percent, 10.25 percent, and 9.75 percent, respectively.
The CBE has decided to launch regular repurchasing agreements (repo) as part of its monetary policy operational framework on every Tuesday starting March 22, 2011.
In November 2020, it reflected a transitory supply shock in tomatoes.
In the meantime, the global financial crisis continues to interrupt the domestic growth momentum, bringing domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q3 to 4.3 percent compared to 7.1 in 2007/08.
Meanwhile, annual core inflation decelerated for the second consecutive month in April 2023 to record 38.6 percent, breaking its upward trend that lasted since mid 2021.
The annual rate continued to ease registering 7.69 percent in December following 7.81 in November.
The headline CPI inflation showed a modest acceleration in June, reaching 20.2% as domestic food inflation was broadly unchanged.
The MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations.
In its monthly meeting held on November 10, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a neutral stance keeping the overnight deposit rate and the overnight lending rates at 9 percent and 11 percent per annum, respectively.
Nonetheless, as inflation is projected to decline significantly over the coming months, the scope to move towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing in order to prevent economic growth from falling below its potential.
The inflation outlook incorporated the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures, that include reaching cost recovery for most fuel products as well as fuel price indexation to underlying costs.
This was also reflected in the unemployment rate which recorded 9.6% in 2020 Q2 up from 7.7% in 2020 Q1.
Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the current moderation in inflation has been driven by improvements in market dynamics, as reflected by the significant decline in annual food inflation to 31.9 percent in June 2024 from a peak of 73.6 percent in September 2023.
Judging by the structure of the banking system’s balance sheet, the share of wholesale funding has been marginal whereas retail deposits correspond to more than two thirds of the banking system’s liabilities.
Annual headline CPI jumped to 11.08 percent in November from 9.70 percent in October, partly on the back of unfavorable base effect from last year, while core inflation increased to 7.44 percent from 6.26 percent in October.
Output remained unfavorably impacted by domestic as well as external factors.
The recent dampening of inflation dynamics generally suggests a normalization to their usual monthly pattern prior to March 2022.
The path for future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations.
Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 2.0 percent during 2020 Q4, up from 0.7 percent during the previous quarter.
Latest available data in 2019 Q2 showed that private domestic demand outpaced net exports as the main driver of economic activity since the beginning of 2019, driven by the acceleration in private investment growth, which recorded the highest growth in 2018/19 since 2005/06, as well as the gradual recovery in private consumption.
This reflects the impact of the COVID19 outbreak and the accompanying containment measures.
Domestic demand contributed 4.8 percentage points to the 4.5 percent real GDP growth in the first half of 2015/16, while net external demand contributed negative 0.3 percentage points.
Inflation rates benefited from the combined effect of a gradual dissipation of previous shocks supporting a return to normal dynamics; the recent tightening cycle; and a favorable base effect from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023.
MPC decides to keep key policy rates unchanged Cairo, Egypt — In its meeting today, the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 27.25 percent, 28.25 percent, and 27.75 percent, respectively.
Annual headline inflation continued to decline in March and April 2018 to record 13.1 percent, while annual core inflation continued to decline in March to 11.6 percent and remained roughly unchanged in April.
To this end, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) moved to a durably flexible exchange rate regime, leaving the forces of supply and demand to determine the value of the EGP against other foreign currencies, while prioritizing the primary goal of achieving price stability, and building up sustainable, adequate levels of Foreign Exchange Reserves.
The Committee is closely tracking the inflation risks that may arise from possible supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, among other factors.
Inflation is forecasted to hover around current levels until Q4 2024 given the implemented and projected fiscal consolidation measures.
Therefore, it becomes clear that the fundamental requirements for the domestic banking sector to continue to function smoothly are entrenched in the system, lending the necessary support to the economy’s growth momentum going forward.
Consistent with the inflation outlook and the targeted disinflation path, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.79 percent in September compared to a decline of 0.23 percent in August, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged at 5.55 percent, on the back of a favorable base effect from the previous year.
MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 basis points to 21.25 percent, 22.25 percent, and 21.75 percent, respectively.
The Central Bank of Egypt sets its deposit rate at 9.5 % per annum.
f In its meeting held on April 28, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Leading indicators generally suggest a continued improvement of economic activity, despite weaker momentum in nonhydrocarbon sectors.
Accordingly, annual core inflation increased to 2.5 percent in April 2020 from 1.9 percent in March 2020.
The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation.
The re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.
The latest monthly developments in headline inflation were largely driven by higher prices of several domestic food items on the back of supply bottlenecks in the distribution channels, despite the decline in international food prices, in addition to the effect of Eid festivities.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 14.6 percent in August 2022 from 13.6 percent in July 2022.
Domestically, real GDP growth softened to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 compared to 2.3 percent in Q4 2023.
In preparation for the successful implementation of these measures, sufficient funding has been secured to avail foreign exchange liquidity.
Real GDP growth stabilized at 5.4 percent in 2018 Q2, after rising for six consecutive quarters.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 9.50 percent per annum.
The indicators of real economic activity suggest, on balance, that the recovery continues and that real output growth is now gradually approaching its targeted rate.
Against this background and given the continuation of tightening real monetary conditions, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate at this juncture.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 1.18 percent (m/m) in October following a decline of 0.31 percent (m/m) in September on the back of sporadic increases in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food prices.
Moreover, stable inflation rates are conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth.
Given these developments, annual headline inflation is expected to remain above the MPC’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4.
In accommodation of firstround effects of supplyshocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated before it is targeted to decline to 13% (+/ 3%) by 2018 Q4 and to singledigits thereafter.
Accordingly, the gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations suggest that inflation is on a sustained downward trajectory.
The overall loanstodeposit ratio is around 55 percent, with a high proportion of assets being short term and liquid.
International oil prices recently increased and remain subject to volatility due to potential supplyside factors.
In addition, recently reintroduced COVID19 lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supplychain disruptions.
Additionally, higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017 as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressures.
The structure of economic growth shifted with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser extent.
In its meeting held on August 25, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 8.25 percent and 9.75 percent, respec�vely, and the 7day repo at 9.25 percent.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 9 percent per annum.
The discount rate was also raised by 50 bps to 11.5 percent per annum.
Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 12.4 percent in 2016/17 Q2, continuing its downward trend after peaking at 13.4 percent in 2013/14 Q2.
Real GDP growth continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter in September 2017 to record 5.2 percent, thereby growing on average by 4.8 percent over the first nine months of 2017 which records the fastest pace since 2010.
The stabilization in the annual headline inflation rate came due to the combined effect of the higher annual contribution of food items, and the lower annual contribution of nonfood items.
This increase is attributed mainly to food items and further supported by nonfood items.
The decline in annual headline urban inflation was driven by lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset slightly higher annual contribution of nonfood items.
During the first three quarters of 2011/2012, real GDP expanded by 1.8 percent on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector which was partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors.
Annual headline inflation continued to decline to record 4.8 percent in September 2019 and 3.1 percent in October 2019, the lowest rate since December 2005.
In the meantime, investment continued to improve for the third consecutive quarter.
Accordingly, monthly core inflation recorded 0.7 percent in October 2017 compared to an average of 0.3 percent in August and September.
The MPC had acted preemptively in its extraordinary meeting on November 3, 2016 by raising the key CBE rates 300 basis points in anticipation of the inflationary pressures.
Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the significant decline in annual food inflation continues to drive down overall inflation and reflects a contained inflationary impact.
Headline CPI increased by 0.84 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 0.73 percent (m/m) in May while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 8.20 percent in June.
Domestically, domestic inflation rates continued to hold at moderate levels.
Upside risks on the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of lower oil prices and the consequent downward revision in international food price forecasts.
Meanwhile, international oil prices declined due to lower demand, yet remain subject to volatility due to potential supplyside factors that include geopolitical risks.
At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks.
In its meeting held on November 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent, respectively.
The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 8.75 percent.
The deceleration of inflation implies a return to normal monthly dynamics given the recent tightening cycle, with the receding impact of previous exchange rate and supply shocks.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8.25 percent per annum.
On the other hand, annual core CPI declined to 7.23 percent in December from 7.44 percent in November, supported by a favorable base effect from the previous year, despite the slight monthly inch up of nonfood prices.
Based on the targeted reserve money and the inflation outlook assessed in the extraordinary MPC meeting on November 3, 2016, tightening monetary conditions was warranted, and the CBE raised its key policy rates by 300 basis points and absorbed excess liquidity via longerterm deposit auctions.
The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 19.25 percent.
December 6, 2012 In its meeting held on December 6, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 9.25 percent and 10.25 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 9.75 percent.
It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices proves to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have been revised upwards compared to the forecasts underlying the previous meeting, mainly due to rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The annual rate declined to 7.10 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last year down from 8.21 percent recorded in September.
While nonfood prices increased by 1.68 percent and 0.36 percent in October and November, respectively, these increases have been largely seasonal, associated with the beginning of the school year in October and Eid festivities in November.
The annual rate increased to 9.65 percent in December from 8.93 percent registered in the previous month, largely led by unfavorable base effects.
Noting these developments, the Central Bank of Egypt reiterates its commitment to safeguard the requisite conditions for sustainable economic development and reaffirms its main mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term.
On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 0.14 percent (m/m) in August after increasing by 1.04 percent in July, bringing the annual rate to 8.97 percent from 9.06 percent recorded in the previous month.
In its meeting held on April 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 10.75 percent, 11.75 percent, and 11.25 percent, respectively.
The gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations since the beginning of the year suggest that inflation remains on a downward trajectory, albeit restrained by the drag of fiscal measures.
Consequently, recent exchange rate dynamics are supporting the tightening of monetary conditions, which will anchor inflation expectations, and dampen the inflation outlook going forward.
Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the previous unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium term.
It is important to underscore that the December inflation outturn is expected to reflect unfavorable base effects from last year, which has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stance.
Moreover, sizable foreign direct investment inflows, substantial improvement in external financing conditions, and their subsequent impact on foreign reserve accumulation, as well as increasing domestic and foreign demand for Egyptian pound denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability.
The annual headline CPI inflation declined to 7.5 percent (y/y) in October and to 6.8 percent in November.
Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium term.
Economic growth in 2021 Q2 was driven by the strong positive contributions of gross domestic investments as well as that of consumption.
The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 19.25 percent.
Annual headline urban inflation stabilized at 4.5 percent in March and February 2021, after registering 4.3 percent in January 2021.
In the Committee's assessment for the last month, there has been no significant change in the balance of risks to price stability.
The CBE will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to act in order to ensure price stability.
Consequently, upward adjustments in administered prices and increases in the prices of volatile food items have recently widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rates.
Meanwhile, real GDP expanded by a mere 0.4 percent in 2010/2011 Q4 following the significant contrac�on of 4.3 percent recorded the previous quarter.
This was mainly attributed to an increase in employment compared to the previous quarter.
Current policy rates remain in line with achieving single digit inflation as soon as the effects of fiscal consolidation measures dissipate.
In its meeting held on October 29, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
Since the MPC meeting on August 17, 2017, annual headline inflation declined to 31.9 percent from 33.0 percent in July, while monthly headline inflation declined to 1.1 percent from 3.2 percent.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit and discount rate unchanged at 11.5 percent per annum.
Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices primarily due to higher oil prices while food price increases were relatively tame.
The increase was driven by higher prices of core food, retail items and services.
Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 3.8 percent in 2016/17 Q2 following the 3.4 percent recorded in Q1.
This comes as a result of the moderation of monthly headline inflation rates between August and October 2017 to around 1.1 percent, compared to an average of 1.6 percent in the corresponding months in 2016.
Annual headline urban inflation increased to 5.9 percent in April 2020 from 5.1 percent in March 2020 due to a combination of unfavorable base effect stemming from muted price increases in April 2019 as well as higher prices increases in April 2020 which is broadly attributed to the impact of the outbreak of COVID19 as well as a stronger seasonal factor due to Ramadan.
January 16, 2014 In its meeting held January 16, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively.
Elevated global and domestic prices are expected to keep headline inflation above the MPC’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4.
Thereafter, the pickup of economic growth was led by real estate, trade and construction sectors.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline in November 2017 for the fourth consecutive month to record 26.0 percent and 25.5 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.
Inflation in August was mainly driven by an upward adjustment of regulated prices due to higher electricity tariffs, as well as by the increase in prices of fresh vegetables.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10.5 percent per annum.
In addition, inflation remains susceptible to upside risks as key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have exhibited volatility due to supply chain disruptions stemming from geopolitical tensions, and adverse weather conditions.
Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline to record 8.7 percent and 5.9 percent in July 2019, respectively, the lowest rates in almost four years, notwithstanding the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures that reached cost recovery for most fuel products.
While annual food inflation is still increasing, it is being driven by volatile items as opposed to core food items in earlier months.
Meanwhile, annual nonfood inflation increased slightly for the second consecutive month to 6.3 percent in May 2021 from 6.1 percent in April 2021.
On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have marginally tightened compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting.
Notable factors include the outlook for global supply bottlenecks and global economic activity, especially in light of the reopening in China coupled with the recent financial sector issues in advanced economies.
Amendment to the MPC Schedule The next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday October 5, 2006.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 9 percent per annum.
Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook still outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to further cut the key CBE rates.
Economic activity continued to improve with real GDP growing by a revised 5.0 percent in 2016/17 Q4 and more recent activity indicators solidifying the improvement.
Real GDP growth stabilized around 5.6 percent in 2019 H2 compared to its level in FY2018/19.
This comes after real GDP growth recorded 2.2 percent (y/y) during 2013/14.
Monetary Policy Stance Given the monetary tightening since February, the MPC believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation.
Inflationary pressures continued to recede, as annual headline and core inflation edged downward for the fourth month in a row to reach 27.5 percent and 26.6 percent in June 2024, respectively.
Meanwhile, the annual real GDP growth for 2009/10 Q4 was revised downwards from 5.9 percent to 5.4 percent.
Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments in Europe have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on external demand and investment in Egypt.
Nevertheless, global inflationary pressures began to build after the world economy emerged from the disruptions caused by the COVID19 pandemic.
On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices continue to be revised downwards compared to those underlying the previous MPC meetings.
Available data indicate that net external demand continued to support economic activity, while private domestic demand remained contained during 2018 Q3.
Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth during November and December came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation.
On the other hand, core CPI increased by 0.65 percent in May compared to 0.23 percent in April, while the annual rate inched up to 8.14 percent in May after registering 7.91 percent in April.
Real GDP growth increased slightly to 5.5 percent in 2018 Q4 from 5.3 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent from 10.0 percent, registering its lowest level since December 2010.
Global inflationary pressures have also eased as a result of a mix of factors, most notably the monetary policy tightening on the part of major central banks, the declining energy prices, and a reduction in global supply bottlenecks.
This decline was supported by favorable base effects and a lower contribution from food prices, while the contribution of nonfood prices remained broadly unchanged.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 15.75 percent, 16.75 percent, and 16.25 percent, respectively.
Looking forward, inflation is expected to moderate further over the coming months.
Annual headline inflation rates were affected by favorable and then unfavorable base effects during April and May 2021, reflecting the early impact of the outbreak of COVID19 and its related containment measures on inflation readings during 2020.
Consequently, the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions are warranted in commitment to its pricestability mandate.
This comes after headline inflation declined to 12.0 percent in December 2018 due to the reversal of the transitory supply shock related to select vegetables.
The declining trend in international food prices suggest that the international food price shock might be waning.
Preliminary figures for 2023 Q1 portray that economic activity is mainly supported by the positive contributions of tourism, agriculture and construction.
In the meantime, international prices for commodities such as food and select minerals have continued to increase but at a slower rate.
These monthly developments were largely driven by bottlenecks in the distribution channels of butane gas cylinders, along with tame price increases in some food items that were outweighed by declines in others.
In light of the upcoming 2006 World Bank/International Monetary Fund Annual Meetings held in Singapore between September 11 and 20, the MPC meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday October 5 instead of Thursday September 21.
Domestically, real GDP growth moderated to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter, mainly reflecting negative spillovers from geopolitical tensions and maritime trade disruptions to the services sector.
Meanwhile, real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 5.7 percent in 2019 Q2, compared to 5.6 percent in the previous quarter, leading to an estimated growth rate of 5.6 percent for the fiscal year 2018/19, the highest since the fiscal year 2007/08.
Meanwhile, partially offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual nonfood inflation to 4.9 percent in September 2021 from 5.3 percent in August 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since December 2012.
Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline reaching an 18month low of 9.9 percent in June 2009, compared to 10.2 percent in May, down from the 23.6 percent peak recorded in August 2008.
The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the mediumterm.
The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation target.
On a sectoral level, tourism, nonpetroleum manufacturing and natural gas extractions contributed most towards growth in economic activity with private sector activity remaining the main contributor towards overall GDP growth.
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 9 percent per annum.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 5.2 percent in 2011/2012 Q3, following feeble average growth rates of 0.35 percent in the first two quarters.
Meanwhile, the annual rate declined from 7.6 percent in October to 7.0 percent in November and December supported by favorable base effects from last year.
In their deliberations during the MPC meeting on October 4, the members decided not to raise interest rates, however, with the sentiment to review this decision in its next meeting.
In addition to oil price developments, risks from the external economy continue to include the pace of tightening financial conditions.
While these shocks have flattened the disinflation path, they do not characterize the underlying inflationary pressures.
The decline of annual food inflation was mostly driven by fresh vegetables.
The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growth.
Moreover, the MPC is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressures which continue to tilt the balance of risks to the upside.
Moreover, there are concerns related to the global recovery on the back of renewed worries regarding fiscal challenges facing the Euro Area.
Incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, notwithstanding the expected impact of unfavorable base effects on near-term inflation rates due to the reversal of the transitory shock to prices of fresh vegetables in the previous year.
Job creation supported the decline of the unemployment rate to 9.9 percent in 2018 Q2, the lowest rate since 2010 Q4.
Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, albeit recovering and beginning to set the stage for monetary policy normalization.
The headline and core annual rates thereby registered in April 2018 the lowest since May and April 2016, respectively.
The Banking System The Egyptian banking system continues to be relatively isolated from the global turbulence as domestic banks have very limited exposure to the failed and stressed global financial institutions.
Recent inflation dynamics since the Special MPC on March 6, 2024 serve as an early indication of monthly dynamics normalizing to their usual pattern prior to March 2022.
The discount rate was unchanged.
Against this background and in light of previous monetary policy actions, the MPC decided to keep the key policy rates unchanged.
And because the path for current policy rates remains a function of mediumterm inflation expectations rather than current inflation outturns, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 50 basis points.
Core inflation rose to 12.37 percent in June 2016 from 12.23 percent in May 2016, while the monthonmonth rate dropped to 0.74 percent in June from 3.15 percent in May.
Meanwhile, annual food inflation remained stable after contributing to the decline in January 2021, in light of the continued reversal of the transitory shock in tomato prices.
However, annual broad money growth has also increased excluding revaluation effects due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation, as well as higher loans to the private sector in domestic currency.
The annual headline CPI inflation inchedup to 8.45 percent (y/y) in August compared to 8 percent in July.
On the other hand, core CPI remained unchanged in May compared to 0.97 percent increase in April.
In its meeting held on June 11, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 8.75 percent, 9.75 percent, and 9.25 percent, respectively.
The softening is driven by declining public contribution to economic activity due to the impact of Red Sea maritime trade disruption on the service sector.
The MPC emphasizes that anchoring inflation expectations is critical and warrants this policy response to bring the real interest rate into positive territory.
Going forward, economic activity will continue to expand albeit at a slowerthan previously projected pace, partially due to the unfavorable spillovers of international developments emanating from the RussoUkrainian war.
Domestic demand came largely due to consumption expenditure, while the contribution of investment expenditure was weak.
Egypt’s GDP growth is expected to recover albeit gradually, with structural measures expected to support economic activity.
Economic activity remained sluggish in 2012/2013 on the back of weak growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing, construction and tourism, in addition to the contraction in the petroleum sector.
Meanwhile, real GDP grew by 4.3 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q2 to record 5.6 percent (y/y) in the first half of the fiscal year, supported by the record growth witnessed in the first quarter.
Annual broad money (M2) growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components, recording 39.4 percent in May 2017.
These recent developments necessitate additional tightening in the monetary stance, not only to contain demand side pressures as mentioned above, but also to avoid broad and persistent inflationary effects that could emanate from the supply shocks, with the aim of anchoring inflation expectations.
Annual food inflation increased in March 2021 after remaining stable in February 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of volatile food items as well as core food items, but by a lesser extent, in line with their seasonal patterns.
