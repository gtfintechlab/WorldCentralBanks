        "The discount rate was also raised by 300 basis points to 16.75 percent.",
        "On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have slightly eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting.",
        "In addition, financial conditions broadly stabilized, with several central banks indicating that their inflation may have peaked and potentially started its deceleration path.",
        "Nonetheless, the outlook for international commodity prices remains uncertain, as several factors contribute to upside and downside pressures.",
        "Notable factors include the expected global economic slowdown, the loosening of COVID19 restrictions in China, and the continued uncertainty from the RussiaUkraine conflict on the overall outlook for global supply chains.",
        "Domestically, economic activity picked up in 2022 Q3, registering a preliminary figure of 4.4 percent compared to 3.3 percent in 2022 Q2.",
        "Real GDP growth was primarily driven by the positive contributions of agriculture, wholesale and retail trade and tourism.",
        "Additionally, most leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2022 Q4.",
        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.4 percent in 2022 Q3, slightly up from the 7.2 percent recorded in the previous quarter.",
        "Annual headline urban inflation continued to accelerate further during 2022 Q4, reaching 18.7 percent in November 2022, its highest rate since December 2017.",
        "Similarly, annual core inflation continued its upward trend that started over a year ago, recording 21.5 percent in November 2022, its highest rate since November 2017.",
        "November’s 2022 inflation figure was mainly impacted by the depreciation of the Egyptian pound that took place in October 2022, as well as the higher broad money growth and the ongoing repercussions of the RussiaUkraine conflict.",
        "Since the beginning of calendar year 2022, annual food inflation was mainly driven by core food inflation.",
        "Moreover, the annual inflation of services was mainly driven by expenditure on restaurants and cafes, while the increase in retail items was broadbased.",

        "The MPC judges that demand side pressures have recently increased, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity, higher broadbased inflation outturns, and higher broad money growth.",
        "In accordance with the CBE’s resolve to achieve price stability over the medium term and in line with the preannounced disinflation target path, the MPC has set its upcoming inflation targets at 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.",
        "Against this background, the MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 300 bps to contain inflationary pressures and to steer annual headline inflation rates towards its upcoming targeted levels.",
        "The committee notes that the future path of inflation remains a function of the cumulative tightening in its stance to date and the lag with which monetary policy tools operate.",
        "The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will continue to utilize all available monetary policy tools to anchor inflation expectations, contain demandside pressures and second round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation targets.",

        "In addition, recently reintroduced COVID19 lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supplychain disruptions.",
        "Domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2022 Q1, albeit at a slower pace, registering a preliminary growth figure of 5.4 percent, compared to 8.3 percent in 2021 Q4.",
        "Detailed sectoral growth data for 2021 Q4 portrays that economic activity was supported by the robust positive contribution of tourism, nonpetroleum manufacturing and trade.",
        "The witnessed softening in economic growth is attributable to several factors most notably the impact of the RussoUkrainian conflict, as well as the diminishing of the positive base effect observed during the previous three quarters.",
        "Leading indicators for 2022 Q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishes.",
        "Going forward, economic activity is expected to expand at a slower than projected pace.",
        "This is mainly a result of the unfavorable spillovers emanating from the Russo Ukrainian conflict.",
        "Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 7.2 percent.",
        "The witnessed decline stemmed from the increase in employment figures which more than offset the increase in the labor force.",
        "Annual headline urban inflation continued to increase, but at a slower pace, to record 13.5 percent in May 2022, from 13.1 percent in the previous month.",
        "In addition, annual core inflation – which excludes volatile food and regulated items – witnessed also a slower pace of increase for the second consecutive month.",
        "It continued its upward trend to record 13.3 percent in May 2022 from 11.9 percent in the previous month.",
        "The increase in annual headline inflation was attributed to nonfood items, since food items' annual inflation decelerated for the first time since the beginning of the year supported by the reversal of the supply shock witnessed in previous months in some fresh vegetables.",
        "May 2022 inflation reading continued to be affected by the depreciation of the Egyptian Pound, as well as by the repercussions of the RussoUkrainian conflict on commodities.",
        "The MPC treats the developments stemming from the RussoUkrainian conflict to be among the exogenous shocks that are outside the scope of monetary policy and yet may lead to transitory deviations from preannounced target rates.",
        "Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demandside pressures and secondround effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation targets.",
        "Therefore, in accommodation of the first round effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafter.",
        "In its decision to maintain policy rates unchanged today, the MPC takes note of its policy rate hikes in the previous two meetings and will continue to assess their impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium term.",
        "Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real incomes.",

        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 11.75 percent.",
        "The CBE also decided to increase the required reserve ratio to 18 percent from 14 percent.",
        "This works as a catalyst, complementing the tightening stance that the CBE is maintaining, by calibrating liquidity conditions.",
        "On the global front, forecasts for the global economic activity have dampened due to spillover effects from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Furthermore, global financial conditions are expected to tighten further as major central banks continue to raise policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary pressures in their respective countries.",
        "In contrast, global commodity prices, such as international prices of oil, have slightly declined, as a result of weakening demand due to global recession expectations.",
        "Domestically, economic activity has grown by a preliminary figure of 3.2 percent in 2022 Q2, implying that fiscal year 2021/22 registered a growth rate of 6.6 percent, compared to 3.3 percent in the previous fiscal year.",
        "Latest available data for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows that GDP growth was mainly driven by the private sector, particularly nonpetroleum manufacturing, tourism, and trade.",
        "Meanwhile, public sector activity was supported by natural gas extractions, Suez Canal and the general government.",
        "Moreover, select leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2022 Q3.",
        "However, economic activity is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously projected, given the uncertainty and negative spillovers from the global scene.",
        "In the labor market, both employment and the labor force figures increased by similar magnitudes, therefore, the unemployment rate remained stable at 7.2 percent in 2022 Q2.",

        "Similarly, annual core inflation which excludes volatile food and regulated items increased to 16.7 percent in August 2022 from 15.6 in July 2022.",
        "The increase in annual inflation since the beginning of 2022 is emanating predominately from supply side issues particularly international commodity prices.",
        "Despite rising annual figures, the recorded monthly rates are lower than the recent highs witnessed during March and April 2022.",
        "Therefore, the MPC concurs that the current key CBE rates coupled with the increased required reserve ratio are consistent with achieving price stability over the medium term.",
        "Noting that the previous tightening policy rates by 300bps is still transmitting through the economy, the MPC will continue to assess the impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium term.",
        "The elevated annual headline inflation rate will continue to be temporarily tolerated above the CBE’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4.",
        "The CBE remains committed to achieving low and stable levels of inflation over the medium term which is a requisite condition towards sustainable economic growth.",

        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 8.75 percent.",
        "Annual headline inflation increased to 5.9 percent in December 2021 from 5.6 percent in November 2021, resuming its upward trend since May 2021.",
        "The upward trend was driven by unfavorable base effects resulting from the low inflation levels that were recorded in the second half of 2020, as well as higher international commodity prices and various fiscal consolidation measures.",
        "Furthermore, annual inflation developments in December 2021 in specific were affected by the reversal of a shortlived tomato supply shock witnessed during December 2020.",
        "In addition, annual core inflation increased for the fourth consecutive month in December 2021 to record 6.0 percent from 5.8 percent in November 2021, partly affected by unfavorable base effects which reflect the muted inflationary pressures during December 2020.",

        "While inflation has declined worldwide, key central banks have maintained a tight monetary policy stance to ensure that inflation converges to its target level.",
        "For international commodity prices, particularly energy, the outlook remains uncertain surrounding demand and supply over the medium term, especially that supply continues to be vulnerable to supply shocks stemming from geopolitical tensions.",
        "Meanwhile, in emerging economies the credit risk outlook has improved in anticipation of monetary easing cycles in advanced economies.",
        "Domestically, real GDP growth recorded 2.3 percent in Q4 2023, bringing growth in the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2023/24 down to 2.5 percent compared to 4.2 percent in the corresponding period of the previous year.",
        "The slowdown in economic activity is mainly attributed to the declining contribution of the manufacturing sector.",
        "Leading indicators for Q1 2024 suggest that economic activity remains subdued.",
        "Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to soften further in FY 2023/24 compared to the previous fiscal year.",
        "Real economic activity is expected to pick up as of FY 2024/25.",
        "Inflationary pressures continued to ease since annual headline and core inflation already peaked at 38.0 percent in September 2023 and 41.0 percent in June 2023, respectively.",
        "This decelerating trend was sustained despite the unexpected surge in February 2024, as annual headline and core inflation declined to 32.5 percent and 31.8 percent in April 2024, respectively.",
        "Favorable base effects from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023 played a role in bringing inflation rates down in 2024.",
        "Annual headline inflation rates have been driven by food items since December 2022, although the steady unwinding of annual food inflation has been offset by rising nonfood inflation since November 2023.",
        "Recent inflation dynamics since the Special MPC on March 6, 2024 serve as an early indication of monthly dynamics normalizing to their usual pattern prior to March 2022.",
        "Forecasts indicate that inflation has already peaked and thus, is expected to moderate in 2024, as inflationary pressures begin to subside.",
        "A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in H1 2025 due to the combined impact of recent monetary policy tightening, unification of the foreign exchange market, and favorable base effects.",
        "Moreover, sizable foreign direct investment inflows, substantial improvement in external financing conditions, and their subsequent impact on foreign reserve accumulation, as well as increasing domestic and foreign demand for Egyptian pound denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability.",

        "In view of the above, and the previous MPC decisions to raise key policy rates by a cumulative 800 basis points in Q1 2024, the Committee judges that the current monetary stance remains appropriate to place inflation on a declining trend, and will continue to assess its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.",

        "This is reflected by persistent nonfood and food inflation, which is expected to continue in light of fiscal consolidation measures, as well as prolonged supply side pressures.",

        "The gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations since the beginning of the year suggest that inflation remains on a downward trajectory, albeit restrained by the drag of fiscal measures.",
        "Looking ahead, inflation is expected to stabilize around current levels through Q4 2024 despite the balance of risks being tilted to the upside.",
        "These risks include the persistence of regional tensions, elevated international commodity prices, and higher than anticipated passthrough of fiscal measures.",
        "Starting Q1 2025, inflation is projected to decline as the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and favorable base effect materialize, given the lagged effect of monetary policy decisions.",
        "In view of the above and drawing upon the outcome of previous MPC meetings, the Committee judges that current policy rates remain appropriate to maintain the prevailing tight monetary stance until a significant and sustained decline in inflation is realized.",

        "The Committee will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to sustain the disinflation path and ensure price stability in the medium term.",
        "Special Monetary Policy Committee Meeting The domestic economy has been recently weighed down by foreign exchange shortages resulting in the existence of a parallel exchange rate market and constraining economic growth.",
        "Coinciding with this, external spillovers emanating from global inflationary pressures have continued to accumulate as the world economy witnesses successive shocks.",
        "Such shocks elevated riskoff sentiment and inflation expectations, amplifying underlying inflation.",
        "The resulting exchange rate movements and significant passthrough of international commodity prices, coupled with domestic supply shocks, have resulted in persistent inflationary pressures driving headline inflation to record levels.",
        "Accordingly, while annual inflation figures have been recently declining, they are expected to remain substantially above the Central Bank of Egypt’s inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2024 Q4.",
        "Noting these developments, the Central Bank of Egypt reiterates its commitment to safeguard the requisite conditions for sustainable economic development and reaffirms its main mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term.",
        "To this end, the CBE is committed to continue the transition to a flexible inflation targeting regime.",
        "To ensure a smooth transition, the CBE will continue to target inflation as its nominal anchor, allowing the exchange rate to be determined by market forces.",
        "The unification of the exchange rate is crucial, as it facilitates the elimination of foreign exchange backlogs following the closure of the spread between the official and the parallel exchange rate markets.",
        "In light of the aforementioned, and in line with the continuation of the CBE’s tightening stance, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided in its special meeting to raise the CBE’s overnight deposit rate, the overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 600 basis points to 27.25 percent, 28.25 percent, and 27.75 percent, respectively.",
        "The discount rate was also raised by 600 basis points to 27.75 percent.",
        "Building on the decision to raise rates by 200 basis points in February 2024, the MPC decided to accelerate the monetary tightening process in order to fasttrack the disinflation path and ensure a decline in underlying inflation.",
        "The MPC emphasizes that anchoring inflation expectations is critical and warrants this policy response to bring the real interest rate into positive territory.",
        "While the CBE acknowledges that the tighter stance could result in a shortterm contraction in the private sector’s real credit growth, the persistence of excessive inflationary pressures poses greater risks to its stability.",
        "Thus, the CBE recognizes that price stability fosters an environment conducive to sustainable private sector growth over the medium term.",
        "The announced measures have been adopted as part of a set of comprehensive economic reforms in coordination with the Government, and backed by the steadfast support of multilateral and bilateral partners.",
        "In preparation for the successful implementation of these measures, sufficient funding has been secured to avail foreign exchange liquidity.",
        "Moreover, to prevent the exacerbation of external spillovers on the domestic economy, prudent and complementary monetary and fiscal policies will place the Egyptian economy on a sustainable path to preserve macroeconomic stability, safeguard debt sustainability, and allow for the accumulation of foreign exchange buffers.",
        "The elimination of the parallel foreign exchange market is expected to dampen inflation expectations, rein in underlying inflation and accordingly, headline inflation is projected to follow a steadily decelerating path over the medium term.",
        "Nevertheless, upside risks to the predicted inflation path include regional geopolitical tensions, expected volatility in international commodity markets and the state of global financial conditions.",
        "In light of these risks and changes in macroeconomic dynamics, the reassessment of the CBE's inflation targets will be clearly communicated.",
        "Mindful of the lagged impact of the MPC’s decision to raise key policy rates by an additional 600 basis points, the committee will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook with the aim of strengthening credibility and placing inflation on a downward trajectory.",
        "The MPC judges that this tightening brings the monetary stance to a sufficiently restrictive level, to anchor inflation expectations, and will be maintained for as long as necessary to achieve the desired disinflation course.",
        "Going forward, the monetary stance will be realized in a way that minimizes both, deviations of expected inflation from its target and deviations of real economic activity from the level consistent with its full capacity.",

        "The decision reflects recent developments and outlook at the global and domestic levels since the previous MPC meeting.",
        "Globally, economic growth remains broadly stable, albeit slightly below the prePandemic level.",
        "Monetary policy tightening cycles in advanced and emerging market economies have contributed to a decline in inflation worldwide, with select central banks continuing to cut interest rates as inflation approaches its target levels.",
        "The slight loosening in the policy stance is also motivated by downside risks to employment and economic growth.",
        "In the meantime, despite persistent geopolitical uncertainty, energy prices have slightly declined, but the outlook for commodity prices in general remains uncertain.",
        "Domestically, real GDP growth softened to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 compared to 2.3 percent in Q4 2023.",
        "The softening is driven by declining public contribution to economic activity due to the impact of Red Sea maritime trade disruption on the service sector.",
        "Moreover, the recent uptick in private economic activity was not sufficient to offset the decline in public economic activity.",
        "Updated leading indicators for Q2 2024 indicate that real GDP growth has started to pick up and is expected to gradually recover as of fiscal year 2024/25, following a marked slowdown in fiscal year 2023/24.",
        "Nevertheless, real economic activity remains below potential, supporting the forecasted disinflation path over the coming period, and is projected to remain so until it converges towards its potential over the medium term.",
        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined to 6.5 percent in Q2 2024 compared to 6.7 percent in Q1 2024, mainly driven by robust employment in the agriculture sector.",
        "With the gradual easing of previous shocks, inflationary pressures continued to subside, as annual headline and core inflation edged downward for the fifth consecutive month to reach 25.7 percent and 24.4 percent in July 2024, respectively.",
        "Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the significant decline in annual food inflation continues to drive down overall inflation and reflects a contained inflationary impact.",
        "It is worthy of note that the recorded annual food inflation at 29.7 percent in July 2024 is the lowest in almost two years, reflecting the favorable base effect from the strong inflationary episode in 2023.",
        "Accordingly, the gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations suggest that inflation is currently on a downward trajectory.",
        "The deceleration of inflation implies a return to normal monthly dynamics given the recent tightening cycle, with the receding impact of previous exchange rate and supply shocks.",
        "Inflation is forecasted to hover around current levels until Q4 2024 given the implemented and projected fiscal consolidation measures.",
        "Nonetheless, inflation is expected to decline significantly in Q1 2025 due to the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and favorable base effect.",
        "However, risks to the disinflation path are tilted to the upside given tighter global oil supplies, escalation of regional geopolitical tensions, uncertainty regarding the adoption of protectionist trade policies, and higher than anticipated passthrough of fiscal measures.",
        "In view of the above and leveraging previous MPC decisions, the Committee judges that current policy rates remain appropriate to maintain the prevailing tight monetary stance until a significant and sustained decline in inflation is realized.",
        "The balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook as well as the transmission of previous MPC decisions to the economy will continue to be assessed in a datadriven manner.",
        "The Committee reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than prevailing rates and will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to maintain the disinflation momentum and safeguard price stability over the medium term.",
        "MPC decides to keep key policy rates unchanged Cairo, Egypt — In its meeting today, the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 27.25 percent, 28.25 percent, and 27.75 percent, respectively.",
        "The Committee also kept the discount rate unchanged at 27.75 percent.",
        "The decision reflects recent developments and outlook at the global and domestic levels since the previous MPC meeting.",
        "Globally, the economic growth outlook remains positive albeit below its historical average.",
        "Monetary policy tightening cycles in advanced and emerging market economies have contributed to a decline in inflation worldwide, with select central banks cutting interest rates after inflation approached its targeted levels.",
        "However, key central banks are expected to uphold a tight monetary policy stance for an extended period due to uncertainty surrounding the inflation path and upside risks to inflation.",
        "Furthermore, prices of key international commodities, particularly energy, have recently declined, mainly due to the effect of tighter monetary policy on global demand.",
        "However, commodity prices remain vulnerable to supply shocks stemming from ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
        "Domestically, real GDP growth moderated to 2.2 percent in Q1 2024 from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter, mainly reflecting negative spillovers from geopolitical tensions and maritime trade disruptions to the services sector.",
        "Furthermore, leading indicators for Q2 2024 suggest that economic activity remains subdued.",
        "Consequently, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in FY 2023/24 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering in FY 2024/25.",
        "In addition, labor market data show that the unemployment rate has slightly declined to record 6.7 percent in Q1 2024 from 6.9 percent in Q4 2023.",
        "Inflationary pressures continued to recede, as annual headline and core inflation edged downward for the fourth month in a row to reach 27.5 percent and 26.6 percent in June 2024, respectively.",
        "Inflation rates benefited from the combined effect of a gradual dissipation of previous shocks supporting a return to normal dynamics; the recent tightening cycle; and a favorable base effect from the strong inflationary episodes in 2023.",
        "Despite persistent nonfood inflation, the current moderation in inflation has been driven by improvements in market dynamics, as reflected by the significant decline in annual food inflation to 31.9 percent in June 2024 from a peak of 73.6 percent in September 2023.",
        "Accordingly, the gradual unwinding of food inflation along with the improvement of inflation expectations suggest that inflation is on a sustained downward trajectory.",
        "The recent dampening of inflation dynamics generally suggests a normalization to their usual monthly pattern prior to March 2022.",
        "While pressures could be expected from possible fiscal consolidation measures, inflation is forecasted to stabilize in 2024 around its current levels.",
        "A significant decline in inflation is anticipated in H1 2025 due to the cumulative impact of monetary policy tightening and favorable base effects.",
        "However, upside risks to the forecasted disinflation path remain, including an escalation of current geopolitical tensions, unfavorable climate conditions, both domestically and globally, and higher than anticipated fiscal measures.",
        "In view of the above and building on previous MPC decisions, the Committee judges that the current monetary stance is appropriate to support the sustained moderation of inflation, and will continue to assess its transmission to the economy in a datadriven manner.",
        "The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than prevailing rates and will not hesitate to utilize all tools at its disposal to ensure that the policy stance is set at sufficiently restrictive levels that allow for a sustained decline in underlying inflation, and safeguard price stability over the medium term."

        "On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting, but their outlook remains uncertain.",
        "Notable factors include the outlook for global supply bottlenecks and global economic activity, especially in light of the reopening in China coupled with the recent financial sector issues in advanced economies.",
        "The latter factor has contributed to large volatility in financial conditions indices in key markets such as the US and EU, which confirms an increased level of uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook.",
        "Domestically, growth in real economic activity moderated to 3.9 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 4.4 percent in 2022 Q3, implying that growth during the first half of FY 2022/23 registered 4.2 percent.",
        "Detailed sectoral data for 2022 Q3 show that growth was primarily driven by the improvement in private sector activity, specifically tourism, agriculture and trade.",
        "Additionally, most leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2023 Q1.",
        "Going forward, real GDP growth is expected to soften in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before picking up thereafter.",
        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.2 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 7.4 percent in the previous quarter.",
        "Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase to record 25.8 percent and 31.9 percent in January and February 2023, respectively.",
        "Similarly, annual core inflation recorded 31.2 percent in January 2023 and marked a historical high in February 2023 by recording 40.3 percent.",
        "The witnessed strong dynamics reflect the combined effect of several factors.",
        "These factors include the supply chain disruptions domestically, the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, demand side pressures as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity and high broad money growth outturns.",
        "In addition, the seasonal impact of Ramadan affected both Umrah trips and food prices.",
        "The MPC continues to assess the impact of the frontloaded tightening policies in a datadriven manner, with recent inflation developments showing higher broadbased inflation across CPI items.",
        "These recent developments necessitate additional tightening in the monetary stance, not only to contain demand side pressures as mentioned above, but also to avoid broad and persistent inflationary effects that could emanate from the supply shocks, with the aim of anchoring inflation expectations.",
        "In light of the above, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 200 bps and reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates.",
        "The MPC stresses that achieving a tight monetary stance is a necessary condition to attain the CBE’s upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4.",

        "Nearterm forecasts for inflation have been revised upwards compared to August forecasts, remaining above their respective target levels and posing a challenge for restoring price stability worldwide.",
        "Consequently, policy rates in major economies are expected to remain elevated.",
        "Moreover, while the outlook for global economic growth has increased compared to the previous meeting, this outlook could be dampened by weakening growth in China and the Eurozone recently.",
        "Domestically, growth of real economic activity remained unchanged in 2023 Q1 at 3.9 percent compared to the previous quarter, implying that the first nine months of fiscal year 2022/23 recorded 4.1 percent.",

        "Leading indicators for 2023 Q2 point towards a moderation of real GDP growth.",
        "Given the above, real GDP growth is expected to slow down in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before picking up gradually over the medium term.",
        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate slightly declined to 7.0 percent in 2023 Q2 compared to 7.1 percent in the previous quarter, mainly due to an increase in employment, absorbing new entrants into the labor market.",

        "The continued impact of monetary policy tightening cycles in advanced and emerging market economies has eased inflationary pressures worldwide, and forecasts for inflation in these economies have been revised downwards compared to the previous meeting.",

        "Domestically, real GDP growth slowed down to 2.9 percent in 2023 Q2 compared to 3.9 percent in the previous quarter, implying that fiscal year 2022/23 recorded 3.8 percent compared to 6.7 percent in the previous year.",
        "The marked slowdown is primarily due to a contraction in gross domestic investments while net exports and consumption were the main drivers of growth in economic activity.",
        "Furthermore, real GDP growth is expected to slow down further during fiscal year 2023/24 before gradually pickingup thereafter.",
        "This comes in light of the impact of actual developments and the negative spillovers emanating from geopolitical tensions in the region, especially on the services sector.",

        "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 7.2 percent in 2022 Q4, down from 7.4 percent in the preceding quarter.",

        "The recent deceleration in both annual headline and core inflation is primarily attributed to favorable base effects as well as the ease of major inflationary shocks; such as the domestic supply chain disruptions that affected main core food commodities and the repercussions of the exchange rate developments.",
        "Economic developments following the last MPC meeting were broadly in line with expectations.",
        "The MPC continues to assess the impact of the cumulative policy rate hikes of 1000 bps since March 2022 in addition to the 400 bps increase in the required reserve ratio in September 2022, to contain inflationary pressures in a datadriven manner.",

        "The annual inflation rates continued to be affected by persistent supply shocks, which fed through higher underlying pressures.",
        "Accordingly, the annual acceleration in headline and core inflation during June 2023 is driven by broadbased increases in the prices of most of the CPI items.",
        "In light of the above and given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook, the MPC judges that a policy rate hike of 100 bps is warranted in order to contain the inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations around the CBE’s targets.",

        "Accordingly, the average annual headline inflation recorded 18.7 percent during 2022 Q4 compared to the preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points).",
        "Such developments reflect the impact of the RussiaUkraine conflict and supply bottlenecks globally on the elevated levels of international commodity prices, despite having eased recently, the exchange rate fluctuations since March 2022 as well as other demand side pressures.",
        "The MPC judges that demand side pressures on inflation continue to be present, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity and the impact of recent exchange rate fluctuations, both of which are consistent with higher broad money growth outturns.",
        "To counter these inflationary pressures, the MPC delivered front loaded policy rate hikes of 800 bps in the previous year, of which 500 bps were in 2022 Q4 alone.",

        "On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices, particularly energy, have been revised upwards compared to the forecasts underlying the previous meeting, mainly due to rising geopolitical tensions in the region.",
        "Nonetheless, inflationary pressures have eased worldwide as a result of monetary policy tightening cycles in major economies, as well as favourable base effects.",
        "Consequently, forecasts for headline inflation in key global economies have been revised downwards compared to the previous meeting, yet are still expected to remain above their respective target levels.",
        "Moreover, the outlook for global economic growth has decreased compared to the previous meeting given the impact of continued global policy rate tightening on demand, as well as increasing geopolitical uncertainty in the region.",

        "Annual headline CPI inflation dropped to 14.3 percent in January 2009 compared to 20.3 percent and 18.3 percent in November and December 2008, respectively.",
        "The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the considerable decline in domestic food inflation.",
        "However, it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international commodity prices, which had begun since August 2008, has not been fully reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic markets.",
        "The risks to the domestic inflation outlook are lower in light of the deteriorating prospects for global growth in 2009 and given the sharply declining international commodity prices.",
        "Against this background, the MPC judged that a less restrictive monetary policy stance is required, at this juncture, in order to stabilize economic growth around its potential.",
        "The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective."

    "2017": [
        "In its meeting held on May 21, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 200 basis points to 16.75 percent, 17.75 percent, and 17.25 percent, respectively.",
        "The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 17.25 percent.",
        "Headline inflation registered 1.69 percent (m/m) in April 2017, recording its third consecutive decline due to fading costpush pressures after averaging 4.01 percent (m/m) between November 2016 and January 2017.",
        "Meanwhile, annual headline inflation registered 31.46 percent.",
        "Monthly inflation during April was mainly driven by volatile and core food items, while nonfood items remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Accordingly, core inflation which excludes volatile food items grew by 1.10 percent (m/m) in April, recording a slight increase after decelerating in February and March from the average 4.89 percent (m/m) registered between November 2016 and January 2017.",
        "Nevertheless, as monthly core inflation was lower than the respective month of the previous year, the annual rate declined for the second consecutive month to record 32.06 percent.",
        "While the previous tightening of policy rates and the consistent reduction of shortterm excess liquidity have so far successfully managed to contain underlying inflation excluding supplyshocks, as evident in the inflation developments above, the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted more strongly to the upside with recent economic and monetary data releases pointing to strengthening demandside pressures.",
        "Furthermore, the MPC envisages risks related to inflation expectations resulting from elevated annual inflation levels despite the continued moderation of monthly rates.",
        "Consequently, the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions are warranted in commitment to its pricestability mandate.",
        "Information received since the MPC met in March show continued improvement of economic activity and a reduction of unemployment.",
        "Annual real GDP grew by 3.9 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening from the 3.8 and 3.4 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 3.6 percent recorded in 2015/16 Q3.",
        "This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent in 2016/17 Q3 from 12.4 and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.",
        "From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.",
        "However, annual broad money growth has also increased excluding revaluation effects due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation, as well as higher loans to the private sector in domestic currency.",
        "Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices primarily due to higher oil prices while food price increases were relatively tame.",
        "Meanwhile global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, despite their recent recovery.",
        "To further anchor inflation expectations, the MPC decided to increase transparency regarding the targeted disinflation path in its regular statements as well as in the quarterly series of the monetary policy report introduced in March 2017.",
        "In accommodation of firstround effects of supplyshocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated before it is targeted to decline to 13% (+/ 3%) by 2018 Q4 and to singledigits thereafter.",
        "The MPC believes that this target path is appropriate to minimize undesirable macroeconomic volatility.",
        "Achieving low and stable inflation over the mediumterm supports real incomes and sustains achieved competitiveness gains, which represents a challenge according to Egypt's economic history.",
        "Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demandside pressures and secondround effects resulting from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation targets, as well as to achieve reserve money targets that were designed to be consistent with the inflation targets.",
        "The MPC believes that such a flexible monetary targeting framework is appropriate under the liberalized exchange rate regime.",
        "Against this background, the MPC judges that hiking the CBE's key policy rates is consistent with the targeted disinflation path, and reiterates that the objective of its tighter stance is not to offset effects of supplyshocks, rather to contain underlying inflation excluding supply shocks that is affected by inflation expectations and the buildup of demandside pressures.",
        "The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation target.",
        "In its meeting held on September 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively.",
        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 19.25 percent.",
        "Since the MPC meeting on August 17, 2017, annual headline inflation declined to 31.9 percent from 33.0 percent in July, while monthly headline inflation declined to 1.1 percent from 3.2 percent.",
        "Inflation in August was mainly driven by an upward adjustment of regulated prices due to higher electricity tariffs, as well as by the increase in prices of fresh vegetables.",
        "On the other hand, core food prices registered the lowest increase since August 2016, and prices of services were only affected by the indirect firstround effect of the hydrocarbonsubsidy reforms on inland transportation.",
        "Meanwhile, prices of retail items remained broadly unchanged.",
        "Consequently, annual core inflation declined to 34.9 percent in August from 35.3 percent in July, while monthly core inflation dropped to 0.3 percent from 2.8 percent, recording the lowest monthly inflation rate since July 2016.",
        "Economic activity continued to improve with real GDP growing by a revised 5.0 percent in 2016/17 Q4 and more recent activity indicators solidifying the improvement.",
        "As a result, real GDP growth averaged 4.6 percent during the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/10.",
        "This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, registering the lowest rate since 2011/12.",
        "Available data up to March showed that the structure of economic growth shifted towards increased sustainability, with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser extent.",
        "Tourism, natural gas, trade, construction and nonpetroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growth.",
        "Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement to achieve the CBE's inflation target.",
        "This process was supported by the combination of previous policy rate increases and the recent stability of the Egyptian pound against tradingpartner currencies.",
        "Consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance, annual reservemoney growth adjusted by overnight deposits and sevenday deposit auctions shrunk to reflect the absorption of excess liquidity via longerterm open market operations.",
        "The inflation outlook remains in line with achieving the inflation target.",
        "Against this background and given the continuation of tightening real monetary conditions, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate at this juncture.",
        "The MPC continues to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated deviations from the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.",

        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 19.25 percent.",
        "During October 2017, annual headline and core inflation declined for the third consecutive month to record 30.8 percent and 30.5 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 33.0 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively.",
        "This comes as a result of the moderation of monthly headline inflation rates between August and October 2017 to around 1.1 percent, compared to an average of 1.6 percent in the corresponding months in 2016.",
        "Inflation in October was almost entirely driven by the seasonal effect of higher prices of education services.",
        "Accordingly, monthly core inflation recorded 0.7 percent in October 2017 compared to an average of 0.3 percent in August and September.",
        "Meanwhile, prices of retail items remained roughly unchanged while food inflation continued to drop, supported by the continued decline of core food prices for the second consecutive month.",
        "Real GDP growth continued to increase for the third consecutive quarter to record 5.0 percent at market prices in 2016/17 Q4, thereby averaging 4.6 percent in the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/2010.",
        "This coincided with the continued narrowing of the unemployment rate to record 11.9 percent in 2017/18 Q1, the lowest rate since 2011/12.",
        "Leading indicators suggest a continued improvement of economic activity.",
        "Meanwhile, the sustainability of economic growth improved with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports.",
        "The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growth.",
        "Trade, real estate, construction and tourism were the main sectors driving economic activity.",
        "Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement to achieve the CBE's inflation target.",

        "The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 19.25 percent.",
        "Annual headline inflation in May 2017 fell for the first time since October 2016 to record 29.7 percent compared to 31.5 percent in the preceding month.",
        "The drop was partly due to a favorable base effect stemming from the exchange rate depreciation in March 2016 that strongly impacted prices in May 2016.",
        "Meanwhile, annual core inflation continued to be supported by favorable base effects since March 2017, dropping to 30.6 percent in May from 33.1 percent in February.",
        "Monthly headline inflation stabilized at 1.7 percent in May 2017, while monthly core inflation rose to 2.0 percent in May from 1.1 percent in April.",
        "The impact of the November 2016 economic reform measures on prices of goods and services has largely passedthrough, with the lagged impact affecting prices of items that witnessed delayed or seasonal consumption such as pilgrimage services in May, which contributed by 0.6 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points to headline and core inflation, respectively.",
        "Excluding effects of transitory shocks, underlying inflation remained somewhat higher than consistent with achieving the CBE’s target, affected by pricesetting behavior in line with annual inflation of 10 percent historically, which has been further magnified recently due to secondround effects of the economic reform measures.",
        "This has been reflected especially in food components of core consumer as well as producer prices.",
        "Additionally, higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017 as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressures.",
        "Annual real GDP grew by a revised 4.3 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening from the 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 3.6 percent recorded in 2015/16 Q3.",

        "Tourism, natural gas, trade, construction and nonpetroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growth.",
        "This was partly supported by looser monetary conditions stemming from the exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Annual broad money (M2) growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components, recording 39.4 percent in May 2017.",
        "Excluding revaluation effects, annual broad money growth increased to 22.1 percent in May 2017, mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets as well as higher loans to the private sector, while the contribution of net claims on the government eased given higher net external and nonbank financing.",
        "In the meantime, annual reserve money (M0) growth adjusted by overnight deposits and sevenday deposit auctions declined to reflect the absorption of shortterm excess liquidity, consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance.",
        "Furthermore, currency in circulation outside the CBE as a percent of local currency deposits has been reverting to pre2011 averages, implying normalization of money holding behavior.",
        "Developments in the external environment show some firming of international commodity prices on annual terms, despite registering monthly declines since March 2017 mainly on the back of crude oil prices, while food prices declined at a relatively slower pace.",
        "Meanwhile, global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, given their moderate recovery which supports the gradual tightening of global monetary conditions.",
        "Against this background, the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted more strongly to the upside with recent economic and monetary developments.",
        "Consequently, the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions is warranted to achieve the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.",

        "Tighter real monetary conditions supported the decline, which accelerated in November due to a favorable base effect.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation was affected during this period by continuous supply shocks related to fiscal consolidation measures, leading regulated price adjustments to account on average for 44 percent of monthly headline inflation, in addition to indirect effects on core CPI items.",
        "Real GDP growth continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter in September 2017 to record 5.2 percent, thereby growing on average by 4.8 percent over the first nine months of 2017 which records the fastest pace since 2010.",
        "This coincided with the continued narrowing of the unemployment rate to record 11.9 percent in September 2017, the lowest rate since 2011.",
        "Leading indicators generally suggest a continued improvement of economic activity, despite weaker momentum in nonhydrocarbon sectors.",
        "Available data up to June 2017 confirm that increasing economic growth over the previous three quarters was initially mainly driven by the industrial sector, due to nonpetroleum and petroleum manufacturing as well as natural gas extractions, in addition to the tourism sector.",
        "Thereafter, the pickup of economic growth was led by real estate, trade and construction sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, the expenditure structure continued to rebalance with a moderating contribution from consumption and a rising contribution from net exports.",
        "The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growth.",
        "Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement for disinflation.",
        "This process was supported by previous policy rate increases as well as receding inflationary pressures.",
        "The baseline inflation outlook remains consistent with achieving the CBE's inflation target of 13 percent (±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.",
        "Consequently, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate.",

        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged 19.25 percent.",
        "Since the MPC meeting on July 6, 2017, annual headline inflation inched up to 33.0 percent in July 2017, after remaining broadly unchanged at 29.8 percent in June 2017 compared to May 2017, where it registered the first decline since October 2016.",
        "Meanwhile, annual core inflation rose to 35.3 percent in July from 31.9 percent in June, after declining between March and May.",
        "The recent increase reflected an expected upward adjustment of regulated hydrocarbon prices and a higher VAT rate.",
        "In addition to the direct effects of higher hydrocarbon prices on headline inflation, several CPI items echoed indirect effects, notably food, and services such as inland transportation, cafés and restaurants and outpatient services.",
        "Moreover, other regulated prices also rose such as tobacco, public hospitals, and landline telephones, while higher prices of motor oils and medical products increased the contribution of retail items somewhat.",
        "Prices of retail items have not been contributing to headline inflation since March 2017, except in June due to the seasonal effect of EidElFitr on clothing prices.",
        "Services have been also only contributing marginally to headline inflation since January 2017, except in May due to higher prices of pilgrimage.",
        "Both exceptions reflected a delayed impact of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound on seasonal items.",
        "In the meantime, after bottoming in March 2017, the contribution of core food inflation rose somewhat between April and June and by a greater extent in July, while the contribution of volatile food inflation has been declining, except for an uptick in July, leading core food items to be the main contributor to food inflation since May.",
        "Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth continued to strengthen in the quarter ending June 2017 and leading activity indicators solidify this improvement.",
        "In the quarter ending June, real GDP reportedly grew by 4.9 percent, up from 4.3 percent, 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent in the preceding quarters.",
        "This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to below 12.0 percent in the quarter ending June 2017 from 12.0 percent, 12.4 percent and 12.6 percent in the preceding quarters.",
        "Available data up to March showed that the structure of economic growth shifted towards increased sustainability with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser extent.",
        "Tourism, natural gas, trade, construction and nonpetroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growth.",
        "Given the strengthening of demand indicators, in addition to the strong secondround effects of the economic reform measures implemented in November 2016, and in anticipation of the secondround effects of the subsidyreform measures implemented in June and July 2017, the MPC had raised the CBE's key policy rates to achieve the targeted disinflation path over the specified horizon.",
        "Consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance, annual reserve money (M0) growth adjusted by overnight deposits and sevenday deposit auctions shrunk to reflect the absorption of excess liquidity via longerterm operations.",
        "The MPC reiterates that it tolerates higher inflation as a result of firstround effects of such supply shocks and uses its monetary policy tools to contain the secondround effects.",
        "Incoming information since the MPC last met were broadly as expected, accordingly, the MPC judges that current policy rates remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (+/ 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafter.",
        "Nevertheless, there are several risks surrounding the baseline inflation outlook, notably the evolution of inflation expectations, demandside pressures as well as the magnitude of any subsidyreform measures and their secondround effects.",
        "The materialization of such risks could lead to a stronger than projected loosening or tightening of the committee's stance to ensure that the inflation outlook is consistent with the targeted disinflation path.",
        "The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation target.",

        "Inflation has been mainly driven by tradable items, led by core food items which registered in February the lowest contribution since October 2016, while the contribution of nontradable items dropped since December 2016.",
        "Accordingly, monthly core inflation dropped to 2.61 percent in February 2017 after averaging 4.89 percent between November 2016 and January 2017.",
        "Nevertheless, given elevated monthly inflation rates, annual headline and core inflation registered 30.25 percent and 33.10 percent in February 2017, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, annual real GDP growth recorded 3.8 percent in 2016/17 Q2 following the 3.4 percent recorded in Q1.",

        "However, annual real GDP growth weakened compared to the 4.5 percent registered during the first half of 2015/16.",
        "Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, albeit recovering and beginning to set the stage for monetary policy normalization.",
        "From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components.",
        "Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth between November 2016 and February 2017 came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation.",
        "Furthermore, money growth will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the CBE's monetary financing of the fiscal deficit.",
        "In the meantime, the longerterm absorption of excess liquidity continued to tighten liquidity conditions.",
        "Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to drop after transitory costpush effects diminish and monthly inflation rates moderate, supported by the previous preemptive policy rate hikes, longerterm absorption of excess liquidity, as well as by favorable base effects.",

        "The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 15.25 percent.",
        "Annual headline inflation rose to 28.14 percent in January 2017 due to exceptional monthly increases averaging 4.01 percent between November 2016 and January 2017 that were strongly impacted by the economic reform measures.",
        "The higher monthly inflation in January (4.07 percent) compared to December (3.13 percent) is estimated to be partly driven by relatively higher regular monthly dynamics as well as the introduction of higher custom tariffs in the end of 2016.",
        "Between November 2016 and January 2017, inflation has been mainly driven by tradable items, while the contribution of nontradable items started to decline in December, confirming costpush factors to be the main inflation driver.",
        "Core items experienced the largest increases, particularly food, while the joint contribution of retail and services has been narrowing in relative terms.",
        "In the meantime, noncore food prices (volatile food) and regulated prices also rose somewhat in January.",

        "Annual real GDP growth declined to 3.4 percent in 2016/17 Q1 after averaging 4.3 percent between 2014/15 and 2015/16.",
        "The drop was mainly driven by consumption, while the contribution of gross fixed investment held steady as the increase in private investment offset the decline in public investment.",
        "Furthermore, the negative contribution of net exports narrowed, mainly due to the recovery of exports which registered its first positive contribution to real GDP growth since 2014/15 Q2, while the negative contribution of imports lessened.",
