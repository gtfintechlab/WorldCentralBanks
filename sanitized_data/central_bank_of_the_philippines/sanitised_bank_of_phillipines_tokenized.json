        "The latest projected inflation path has continued to track the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range for 2013 and 2014, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.",
        "- Moreover, the MB considered the prevailing risks to the inflation outlook to be evenly balanced.",
        "Uncertainty over the strength of the global economy and the relative firmness of the peso are the key downside risks to the broad outlook for prices.",
        "However, power rate adjustments and the possibility of a sustained surge in liquidity owing to strong capital inflows could push inflation higher as well.",
        "- Following its move to rationalize the SDA facility in January and March, the MB also decided to set the interest rates on the SDA facility to 2.0 percent, applicable to all tenors.",
        "- The MB noted that the benign inflation environment and robust domestic growth prospects provided scope for further enhancing the efficiency of the operations for absorbing liquidity through the SDA facility.",
        "The adjustment is in line with the BSP’s continuing efforts to fine-tune its monetary policy instruments in order to gain greater flexibility in conducting monetary operations, and also to ensure adequate liquidity for economic activity.",
        "A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC).",

        "The highlights of the discussions on the 25 April 2013 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board - Going forward, the MB recognized the need to continuously monitor emerging demand and price developments to ensure that monetary policy settings remain consistent with price stability while being supportive of economic growth.",
        "The MB also reiterated its readiness to employ macroprudential measures as necessary to pre-emptively address any potential misalignment in asset prices.",
        "The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: - Year-on-year headline inflation decelerated in March, driven by lower inflation for both food and non-food items.",
        "Likewise, the number and weight of above-threshold items declined.",
        "Meanwhile, the official core inflation was steady in March, while the alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP were slightly higher.",
        "- Moderate food inflation due to ample domestic supply of key food items, particularly vegetables, fruits, corn, fish, sugar, and oils, led to benign headline inflation in March.",
        "Likewise, slower price increases for non-food items, due largely to the reduction in the prices of domestic petroleum products, helped push down inflation for the month.",
        "- The benign inflation environment is supported by well-anchored inflation expectations.",
        "Inflation expectations based on forecast surveys of private sector economists by the BSP and by Asia Pacific (AP) Consensus remain within the target band for 2013-2014.",

        "- Headline inflation is projected to remain within the target range for the forecast horizon.",
        "Compared to the previous policy meeting, baseline inflation forecast for 2013 has been revised downward due primarily to lower oil prices.",
        "In contrast, the average headline inflation forecast for 2014 was higher in the current forecasting round owing mainly to the higher M3 forecast for 2014.",
        "- The risks to the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced.",
        "Downside risks to the inflation outlook continue to stem mainly from uncertainty in the strength of the global economy.",
        "At the same time, the outlook of a stronger peso given continued foreign exchange inflows is seen to temper imported inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, upside pressures on prices could emanate from possible power rate adjustments.",
        "The possibility of a continued strong surge in liquidity also constitutes an upside risk to inflation.",
        "- The outlook for overall economic activity has remained generally positive, with growth expected to stay near or above the trend over the course of the year.",

        "Developments in Agriculture - Favorable supply conditions have kept prices of meat, fish, fruits and refined sugar generally stable in March 2013 compared to their month-ago levels.",
        "The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) projects palay and corn production to expand in Q1 2013 on account of increased yields and harvest area but could decline in Q2 2013 as some farmers were reluctant to plant amid expectations of dry weather conditions given pronouncements of a possible occurrence of El Niño during the year.",
        "- Meanwhile, the FAO food price index (FPI) was higher in March relative to February, driven largely by increased dairy prices amid prolonged dry weather in New Zealand.",
        "Nevertheless, the FPI remained lower than the year-ago level and below its peak in February 2011.",
        "Prices for the other commodity groups were broadly stable.",

        "In addition, quarter-end window dressing boosted the local bourse.",

        "Likewise, geopolitical tensions in Korea also weighed down on the peso and other regional currencies.",
        "Nonetheless, the country’s strong economic fundamentals and Fitch’s move to upgrade the country’s credit rating to investment grade tempered the peso’s depreciation.",
        "- Bond spreads eased in early March due to the unexpectedly strong US non-farm payrolls in February and the subsequent decline in US unemployment rate.",
        "The improving US macroeconomic environment translated into an increase in US Treasury yields with US 10-year bonds breaching the 2 percent level.",
        "This boosted “risk-on” trading of bonds like ROPs, which, in turn, led to a decline in the country’s bond yields and tightening in debt spreads.",
        "However, spreads subsequently widened as the unfolding Cyprus debt crisis re-ignited concerns about the euro zone’s weak banks.",
        "In the first half of April, widening pressures abated as debt spreads tightened marginally.",
        "The market was surprisingly resilient despite reports of a bank run in the wake of the Cyprus bailout and the US private payroll report coming out weaker than expected.",
        "Investors have also shrugged off any lingering jitters over the political tensions between North Korea and South Korea.",
        "Sentiment was likewise buoyed by Bank of Japan’s unveiling of its new monetary policy plan of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing.",
        "Nevertheless, the IMF’s downward revision on global growth, reports of cooling housing market in the US, slump in US retail sales, and lower PMI figures, tempered the narrowing trend.",

        "The pace of growth in emerging markets also remains fairly robust on stable domestic demand.",
        "However, preliminary data also suggest a weaker-than-expected recovery in China, with GDP growth unexpectedly easing in Q1 2013 from the previous quarter.",
        "Moreover, the euro area still faces significant stability challenges from its fiscal and banking sector problems.",

        "Reports of the surge in Philippine exports and factory output in August also helped lift the PSEi in the first half of the month.",

        "From there, inflation is seen to decelerate but remain elevated well into the first half of 2023.",
        "By Q3 2023, inflation will likely revert to within the 2-4 percent target band before settling close to the lower end of the target range in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, largely due to base effects.",
        "Thereafter, inflation will stabilize and return to the midpoint of the target by Q2 2024.",

        "Tracking the movements of international oil prices, the domestic prices of petroleum products, except LPG, were raised on 27 April.",
        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - Electricity rates increased in April due to higher generation costs.",
        "According to Meralco, generation rates went up mainly on account of the 30-day Malampaya maintenance shutdown (15 March – 13 April 2015), which forced power plants to use more expensive liquid fuel in lieu of natural gas.",
        "Consequently, power rates charged by Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) went up.",
        "- The equities market continued to be buoyant in April.",
        "The rally in the first half of the month was prompted by the inflow of foreign capital in the local bourse after the Philippine growth forecast was raised by Fitch Rating, S&P and the IMF.",
        "Also helping boost the benchmark index higher were expectations that the Fed may push back its first rate hike until later in the year.",
        "However, market gains were tempered as investors’ concern over high valuations, slower Chinese GDP growth in Q1 2015 and the possibility of Greece’s default dampened sentiments.",
        "- The peso strengthened slightly in April as a string of soft US data raised uncertainty on the outlook for higher interest rates in the US.",

        "The main upside risk, according to the IMF, continues to emanate from the possible favorable impact of lower oil prices on global demand conditions.",
        "On the downside, risks include geopolitical tensions as well as potential global financial market volatility owing to unanticipated timing and magnitude of future monetary policy adjustments in advanced economies, particularly in the US, amid the uneven pace of activity across economies.",

        "The Monetary Board (MB) decided to: a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 3.50 percent for the overnight RRP b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - The MB’s decision to maintain policy interest rate settings was based on its assessment that current monetary settings remained appropriate, as the cumulative 100-basispoint reduction in policy rates in 2012 continued to work its way through the economy.",
        "The latest baseline forecasts followed a slightly lower path but remained near the lower bound of the target over the policy horizon.",
        "Risks to the inflation outlook were considered to be evenly balanced around the baseline forecasts, with inflation expectations broadly aligned with the inflation target range.",
        "- Moreover, the MB was of the view that global economic activity had stabilized in recent months, although fiscal consolidation and financial market stresses in advanced economies continued to temper overall market sentiment.",
        "Global economic prospects, therefore, were expected to stay subdued, thus mitigating upward pressures on commodity prices.",
        "- At the same time, the MB noted that the domestic economy has gained pace on the back of strong domestic demand and buoyant business sentiment.",
        "The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was stronger than expected at 7.1 percent in Q3 2012, driven by private spending and fiscal stimulus.",

        "A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC).",
        "The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department.",
        "The highlights of the discussions on the 13 December 2012 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on III.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation slowed down in November, driven mainly by lower inflation for food.",
        "Other indicators such as year-on-year core inflation, two out of the three alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP, number of abovethreshold items, and weight of above-threshold items also reflected a downtrend.",
        "Meanwhile, seasonally-adjusted month-on-month headline and core inflation were steady in November.",
        "- Lower food inflation due to ample domestic supply of selected food items, particularly vegetables and oils, led to lower headline inflation in November.",
        "Likewise, slower price increases for non-food items, due largely to the reduction in gasoline and diesel prices, helped push down inflation for the month.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations based on the AP Consensus and BSP’s private sector forecast surveys were within the 3-5 percent target range over the policy horizon.",
        "Results of the BSP private sector survey showed lower inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2013 and a steady inflation forecast for 2014.",
        "Meanwhile, results of the November 2012 AP Consensus survey yielded a steady inflation forecast for 2012 and a slightly lower forecast for 2013.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - The latest baseline forecasts followed a lower path compared to the path from the previous policy meeting, keeping near the lower bound of the target over the policy horizon.",
        "The downward shift in the forecasted inflation path for 2012-2014 was attributed mainly to the lower-than-projected actual inflation rates in October and November, the decline in oil prices, and changes in assumptions on M3 and rice prices.",
        "These factors offset the impact of the higher GDP growth rate and NG deficit assumptions for 2012.",
        "- The risks to future inflation were deemed to be broadly balanced.",
        "Downside risks to inflation outlook continue to persist owing to uncertainty over the strength of the global economy, while the continued appreciation of the peso is expected to temper imported inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the upside pressures on non-oil commodity prices in the international market, pending petitions for domestic utility rate adjustments and continued ample liquidity in the financial system constitute the key upside risks to inflation.",
        "D. Demand conditions - Domestic economic activity has gathered further momentum on the back of strong private spending and ongoing macroeconomic stimulus, implying scope to keep policy settings unchanged.",
        "GDP growth in Q3 was stronger than expected at 7.1 percent, bringing year-todate growth of GDP to 6.5 percent.",
        "Solid gains were recorded across the three major sectors on the production side, with services contributing more than half of Q3 growth.",
        "Agriculture production grew as palay and corn output increased robustly while industry was supported by the growth in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Continuing strength in consumer demand, accelerated government spending, strong growth in construction, and recovery in exports also contributed to GDP growth on the demand side.",
        "- Meanwhile, recent indicators of activity in Q4 2012 suggest that the economy will continue to benefit from domestic drivers of growth.",
        "Vehicle and energy sales have been strong at the start of Q4.",
        "Similarly, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings in October indicated expansion in the manufacturing, retail/wholesale, and services sectors.",
        "Latest business expectations survey results for Q4 2012 also suggest more buoyant business sentiment for the current quarter.",
        "E. Supply-side indicators Developments in Agriculture - The Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing (AHFF) sector expanded at a faster pace of 4.1 percent in Q3 2012 from a growth of 2.2 percent in Q3 2011 and 0.6 percent in Q2 2012.",
        "The expansion in the production of palay, corn and coconut as well as livestock and poultry more than offset the slight decline in fisheries.",
        "For the first nine months of 2012, the AHFF sector expanded by 1.8 percent from 4.9 percent in the same period last year.",
        "- The monthly FAO food price index dipped in October due largely to lower international prices of cereals and oils/fats which more than offset increases in sugar and dairy prices.",
        "The slide in the prices of oils/fats reflected ample supply combined with weak world import demand.",
        "Meanwhile, higher prices of sugar indicated short-term export tightness in Brazil, the world’s largest sugar exporter, but prospects of sufficient supply in the current 2012/13 marketing season limited the gain.",
        "Moreover, a seasonal tightening of supplies and low stocks drove dairy prices higher.",
        "Oil Price Developments - Oil prices further decreased in November as superstorm Sandy dampened demand for crude oil.",
        "Mounting concerns over how the US budget deficit will be resolved, i.e., avoiding the fiscal cliff also exerted downward pressure on oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, oil demand forecasts for 2012 by global energy authorities were generally lower relative to previous assessments.",
        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - The generation charge of Meralco registered an uptick in November due to the higher cost of electricity from power producers (e.g., National Power Corporation and Wholesale Electricity Spot Market).",
        "The increase in the WESM settlement rate was driven by generating companies relying more on expensive oil-fired power plants to compensate for the unavailability of some coal and gas-fired power plants.",
        "The lower output of hydroelectric power plants also contributed to higher WESM rates.",
        "F. Financial market developments - The PSEi surpassed the 5,600 mark for the first time in November 2012 on upbeat investor sentiment on account of the following: Moodys’ upgrade of the Philippine sovereign credit rating in the previous month; the lower-than-expected inflation data in October; positive corporate earnings reported for Q3, particularly for banks; and the strong growth of Philippine exports in September.",
        "- The peso further appreciated in November, supported by strong inflows and positive market reactions to the country's favorable macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "On a yearto-date basis, the peso appreciated in nominal terms against the US dollar by except for the Indonesian rupiah and the Japanese yen, which depreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar.",
        "- Debt spreads tightened further in November amid more signs of economic stabilization in the US and China.",
        "In Europe, recent policy announcements have likewise calmed the market.",
        "Meanwhile, the Philippines’ faster-than-expected economic expansion in Q3 country’s debt papers declined significantly.",
        "G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew at a faster pace of 8.6 percent year-on-year in October from 7.5 percent in September.",
        "Money supply growth was driven by the expansion of net domestic assets (NDA).",
        "The increase in the NDA, in turn, was due to the sustained increase in net domestic credits along with the slower rise in the net other items account (which includes, among other things, revaluation and capital and reserve accounts as well as placements of authorized counterparties in the BSP SDA facility).",
        "Likewise, net foreign assets (NFA) continued to rise in October, supported by steady foreign exchange inflows from overseas remittances and portfolio investments.",
        "- The growth of outstanding loans of commercial banks, net of banks’ reverse repurchase from the previous month’s expansion of 13.5 percent.",
        "Loans for production activities— which comprised more than four-fifths of banks’ aggregate loan portfolio—grew by consumer loans eased slightly to 13.9 percent from 14.6 percent in September due mainly to the slowdown in auto loans.",
        "- Strong domestic demand is also reflected in the latest survey results of the Q3 2012 Senior Loan Officers’ Survey (SLOS) which point to an increase in overall demand for loans.",
        "This has coincided with the sustained expansion in private credit.",
        "- Corporates continue to tap capital markets for financing.",
        "Corporate bond issuances for the period January-October 2012 reached P237.4 billion, 34 percent higher than the Exchange (PSE) during the same period amounted to P192.9 billion, more than double compared to the previous year’s level.",
        "H. Fiscal developments - Government spending continued to gain some momentum.",
        "The fiscal deficit in the period January-October 2012 was P115.7 billion, P41.5 billion higher than the deficit incurred during the same period in 2011.",

        "US unemployment fell below 8 percent for the first time in nearly four years for three consecutive months starting September 2012.",
        "Consumer sentiment has also improved with the stronger labor market despite cautious business sentiment due to concerns on the fragile global economy.",
        "Nevertheless, positive growth prospects remain contingent on the positive resolution of the uncertainty over the extent and effect of fiscal consolidation in 2013.",
        "- Likewise, the pace of growth in China showed signs of stabilizing as a result of fiscal and monetary stimulus.",
        "The manufacturing PMI in China for November estimates rose to a first time since October 2011.",
        "- In contrast, economic activity in the euro area has remained weak.",
        "Euro area GDP contracted for the second time in Q3 2012, bringing the economy back into recession.",
        "Household and business sentiments continue to be at low levels across the region.",
        "Confidence among consumers remained weak as unemployment rate reached a record high at 11.7 percent in October 2012.",
        "Nevertheless, recent policy announcements in Europe have helped to bolster financial market conditions.",
        "Euro area composite PMI estimate for November also showed a very slight increase given the modest increase in PMI manufacturing.",
        "The Monetary Board (MB) decided to: a) Reduce the BSP’s policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 5.75 percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate; b) Reduce accordingly the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - The MB’s decision was based on its assessment that price pressures have been receding, with risks to the inflation outlook slightly skewed to the downside.",
        "Latest baseline forecasts indicated that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the to continue to abate amid weaker global growth prospects.",
        "Inflation expectations continued to moderate at levels consistent with the inflation target.",

        "- The MB believed that a reduction in policy rates can serve as a pre-emptive move against the risk associated with the global slowdown.",
        "The MB was of the view that the world economy has continued to lose momentum and prospects for global economic activity are likely to remain weak.",
        "In the advanced economies, financial markets stress continues to build up, and there remain concerns about the prospects for urgent fiscal adjustments and reforms.",
        "Therefore, while the Philippine economy can rely on the resilience of domestic spending to sustain growth, additional policy support would serve as buffer against strong global headwinds.",

        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation decelerated further in June, driven mainly by lower inflation for non-food items, particularly gasoline and diesel.",
        "Other indicators also reflected a downtrend, including the following: seasonally-adjusted month-on-month headline and core inflation, and the number and weight of above-threshold CPI components.",
        "- In contrast, year-on-year core inflation has been stable.",
        "On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, however, the official measure of core inflation, which excludes some food and energy items, remained higher than headline inflation for the sixth consecutive month in June but lower than the midpoint of the target of 4 percent.",
        "Meanwhile, the alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP showed mixed trends.",
        "In particular, the weighted median was below the headline on a YTD basis while the net of volatile items measures and trimmed mean measures were broadly in line with headline inflation.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations based on the BSP and private sector forecast surveys continued to be steady but remained within the 3-5 percent target range over the policy horizon.",
        "Results of the July 2012 survey from the AP Consensus showed lower inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2013 compared to June.",
        "Meanwhile, results of the July 2012 BSP survey of private sector economists showed an unchanged mean inflation forecast for 2012 and lower average forecasts for 2013 and 2014.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - The latest baseline forecasts continue to point to within-target inflation for 2012 and was unchanged while the slight downward adjustment for 2013 could be attributed mainly to the lower-than-projected actual inflation in June and the decline in domestic oil prices.",
        "- The downside risks to the inflation outlook include concerns over the strength of the global economy and its implications on the pace of domestic economic activity and international commodity prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the potential sources of upside risks include pending electricity adjustments, expectations of higher prices for some food products due to adverse weather conditions in major cereal-producing countries, and firm domestic demand pressures.",
        "D. Demand conditions - Domestic demand conditions remained robust based on available leading economic indicators.",
        "Both BSP and NSCB leading economic indicators indices point to economic upturn in Q2.",
        "At the same time, employment conditions improved in Q2, energy and auto sales recorded gains, manufacturing activity as measured in the MISSI continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate, and the latest Philippine PMI readings indicated expansion for manufacturing, services, and retail and wholesale sectors.",
        "Merchandise exports also posted strong performance while the book-to-bill ratio has continued to remain above one since February 2012.",
        "Meanwhile, the Q2 2012 Consumer Expectations Survey showed a lower consumer confidence index for the current and the next quarter but broadly steady outlook for the year ahead.",

        "- In recent weeks, international cereal prices—mainly for corn and wheat—have increased due to severe drought in the US (the world’s top exporter of corn).",
        "Oil Price Developments - Oil prices fell sharply in June on concerns that the European debt crisis was deepening.",
        "Signs of economic slowdown in China and the US, adding to speculation of faltering oil demand, also pushed oil prices lower.",
        "However, oil prices recovered somewhat in July as Norway, Western Europe’s largest crude oil exporter, faced a shutdown of its oil production platforms due to an energy strike.",
        "Signs that central banks in Europe and China may ease monetary policy and speculation that sanctions against Iran will curb supply also exerted upward pressure on oil prices.",
        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - In July, there were three new rate petitions filed by various power industry players with ERC.",
        "Meralco submitted a petition to increase rates due to under-recoveries for generation, transmission and lifeline subsidies in January to December 2011 while the National Power Corporation (NPC) is seeking an increase in the universal charge for missionary electrification (UCME) to augment its budget in the delivery of electricity in off-grid areas.",

Financial market developments - In July, the PSEi continued to trade above the 5,200 mark as investor sentiment was boosted by the robust Q1 GDP growth, strong Q1 corporate earnings, positive growth in merchandise exports, and S&P’s raising of the country’s debt rating to BB+, the highest level since 2003 and one step below investment grade.",
        "The market’s positive reaction to the agreements reached during the Euro Summit on 28/29 June and monetary easing by the ECB, BOE and PBOC also boosted trading sentiments.",

        "The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department.",
        "The highlights of the discussions on the 13 September 2012 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on III.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation accelerated in August, driven mainly by higher inflation for food, electricity, fuel and transport.",
        "Other indicators such as year-on-year core inflation and seasonally-adjusted month-on-month (m-o-m) headline inflation also reflected an uptrend.",
        "By contrast, seasonally-adjusted m-o-m core inflation slowed down in August.",
        "- The uptick in inflation was due mainly to higher food, electricity, fuel, and transport prices.",
        "Tight domestic supply conditions, triggered by the recent weather-related production disruptions led to higher retail prices of food, particularly vegetables, fish, sugar, fruits, rice, and meat.",
        "Likewise, the increase in the prices of electricity, gas, and other fuels (due, in turn, to higher LPG and kerosene prices) and the upward adjustment in electricity charges as a result of the scheduled maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya pipeline contributed to the rise in inflation.",
        "The series of upward price adjustments in gasoline and diesel also pushed transport inflation higher.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations based on the BSP private sector forecast and AP Consensus surveys were generally higher but remained within the 3-5 percent target range over the policy horizon.",
        "Results of the August survey from the BSP survey of private sector economists showed higher inflation forecasts for 2012 to 2014 compared to July.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - Although the forecast inflation path for 2012-2013 is slightly higher compared to the forecast path in the previous round, the latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation could settle within the government-announced target range of 3-5 percent for 20122013.",
        "Higher-than-projected actual inflation in August and the increase in oil prices led to the slight upward shift in forecast inflation path for 2012-2013.",
        "The latest forecasts also incorporated the estimated impact of the recent petition for jeepney fare increase.",
        "Meanwhile, the emerging inflation forecast for 2014 shows average headline inflation settling within the 3-5 percent target range.",
        "- The risks to future inflation appear to be broadly balanced.",
        "Downside risk to inflation outlook continues to persist owing to lingering concerns over the strength of the global economy and its implication on the pace of economic activity.",
        "Meanwhile, additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments as well as upside pressures on non-oil commodity prices in the international market constitute the upside risks to inflation.",
        "D. Demand conditions - The Philippine economy posted a higher-than-expected growth of 5.9 percent in Q2 an improvement from the 3.6 percent growth in the same period in 2011 and well above the long-run average growth rate of GDP.",
        "Fiscal policy support through early release of allotments to government agencies and higher infrastructure spending contributed to growth in the second quarter.",
        "- Looking ahead to the succeeding quarters, results of the Q3 2012 consumer expectations survey showed higher confidence index for the third and fourth quarters and the year ahead.",
        "Meanwhile, business confidence was lower in Q3 2012 amid concerns over the impact of recent weather disturbances but reached an all-time high for Q4 2012.",
        "Some leading indicators for the second semester also indicated robust domestic demand in July: PMI readings for manufacturing, services, and retail and wholesale sectors remained above 50 while volume sales of automobiles and electricity consumption continued to grow.",
        "E. Supply-side indicators Developments in Agriculture - The growth in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing slowed to 0.7 percent in Q2 production of palay, poultry, coconut, corn and rubber was pulled down by the contraction in the production of sugarcane, fishing and livestock sub-sectors.",
        "- Meanwhile, the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics projects palay and corn production to continue to expand in Q3 and Q4 2012.",
        "Typhoon Gener and the strong monsoon rains appear to have marginal effect on domestic rice and corn production based on staff estimates.",
        "- On the international front, after three consecutive months of decline, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index (FPI) rose by 12 points to 212.8 points in July 2012, albeit still well below the peak of 238 points recorded in February 2011.",
        "The sharp rebound was driven largely by the rise in grain and sugar prices as well as increases in oils/fats prices.",
        "Nevertheless, the FAO FPI was broadly steady at 212.6 points in August as international prices of cereals and oils/fats changed little but sugar prices fell sharply, compensating for rising meat and dairy prices.",
        "Oil and Transport Price Developments - After increasing in July, oil prices further advanced in August on account of falling crude oil stockpiles in the US amid tensions in the Middle East and on expectations of a favorable resolution to the European debt crisis.",
        "High international prices of oil were reflected in the four rounds of increases in the domestic pump prices of petroleum products in August.",
        "- On 30 August 2012, several transport groups filed for an additional P2.00 in minimum jeepney fare before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).",
        "The transport groups also filed for an immediate implementation of a P0.50 provisional jeepney fare hike while public hearing for their petition is ongoing.",
        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - In August, the generation charge of Meralco increased following the upward adjustment in the charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market as natural gas-fired power plants utilized more expensive liquid condensate fuel following the scheduled maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya pipeline in July.",
        "Likewise, the generation cost from independent power producers (IPPs) increased with the series of power outages at the Quezon Power Philippines, Ltd.",
        "The higher generation charges from the WESM and other IPPs offset the cheaper wet-season rates from the National Power Corporation.",
        "F. Financial market developments - The PSEi moved sideways in August and closed 3.0 percent lower than the end-July level but still higher by 17.8 percent year-to-date.",
        "Investors continued to trade cautiously over concerns that the current rise in global oil prices due to geopolitical tensions will pose a further risk to the global economy as major economies, including the US and China, are already contending with the slower growth and fallout from the European debt crisis.",
        "Markets were also anticipating news of additional stimulus from the US Fed and the ECB while investors weighed the economic impact of the enhanced monsoon rains that affected Metro Manila and surrounding provinces in early August.",
        "- In August, the peso slightly depreciated by 0.4 percent relative to the previous month following the release of weak global economic data.",
        "The strength of the US dollar also pressured the peso to revisit 42-levels given less chances of more US stimulus measures.",
        "On the local front, lower-than-expected growth in Philippine exports and slower growth of Overseas Filipinos’ remittances in June weighed on the peso.",
        "- Debt spreads eased to new lows for the year in August.",
        "Sentiment improved on expectations the ECB may resume buying government bonds to bring down cropping borrowing costs of indebted Euro zone members such as Spain and Italy.",
        "Expectations of China and US taking stimulus steps improved risk appetite for emerging market bonds, tightening spreads to its narrowest in the past four months.",
        "However, worries over China’s growth and unclear signs of stimulus measures by the ECB and US Fed contributed in the slight expansion of spreads by end of August.",
        "G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew faster in July at 8.7 percent year-on-year from expansion of net foreign assets (NFA).",
        "Meanwhile, net domestic assets (NDA) decelerated due to the faster expansion of the net other items account owing to higher placements of eligible counterparties in the BSP SDA facility.",
        "Claims on the private sector accelerated during the month, consistent with the sustained increase of bank lending in July.",
        "- The growth of outstanding loans of commercial banks, net of banks’ reverse repurchase previous month’s expansion of 14.9 percent.",
        "Loans for production activities—which comprised more than four-fifths of banks’ aggregate loan portfolio—grew by 16.4 percent in July from 15.1 percent a month earlier.",
        "Meanwhile, the growth of consumer loans eased slightly to 15.4 percent from 15.8 percent in June due mainly to the slowdown in auto loans.",
        "- Corporates continued to tap capital markets for financing.",
        "Corporate bond issuances for the period January-July 2012 reached P199.3 billion, 29 percent higher than the 2011 level of P154.9 billion.",
        "Likewise, the total equity raised in the Philippine Stock Exchange year-ago level.",
        "H. Fiscal developments - The fiscal deficit in the period January-July 2012 was P73.7 billion, P30.0 billion higher than the deficit incurred during the same period last year.",
        "This represented collections increased by 12.1 percent while expenditure was higher by 15.1 percent.",
        "External developments - Recent developments in the global economy suggest that growth is likely to remain weak.",
        "The JP Morgan Global All-Industry Output Index fell anew to 51.1 in August from levels of new orders and falling international trade flows.",
        "Meanwhile, the services sector continued to expand modestly.",
        "- The US economic recovery cools amid increasingly cautious business and consumer sentiments.",
        "Advance estimates showed that real GDP grew slower in Q2 2012 compared to Q1 2012.",
        "The deceleration primarily reflected the slowdown in personal consumption expenditure and residential and nonresidential fixed investments, which was offset partly by the smaller decrease in federal government spending and by the acceleration in exports.",
        "- Prospects in the euro area remain bleak.",
        "The economic contraction in the euro area continued to deepen, as GDP fell by 0.4 percent y-o-y and by 0.2 percent q-o-q in Q2 and service sectors across the region.",
        "- Economic activity remains sluggish in China.",
        "Real GDP growth eased to 7.8 percent y-o-y in Q2 2012 from 8.1 percent in the previous quarter while the manufacturing PMI remained below the 50-percent growth threshold in August.",
        "The Monetary Board (MB) decided to: a) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight RRP b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs; and c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - The MB’s decision is based on its assessment that average inflation is likely to remain within target over the policy horizon, with well-contained inflation expectations.",
        "Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the annual inflation rates for 2012-2013 will settle at the lower end of the 3-5 percent target range.",
        "- The MB decided to keep policy rates unchanged as the economy appears to be moving towards a period of stable inflation and robust growth.",
        "The MB took into consideration the latest domestic macroeconomic readings which have improved significantly in the first quarter.",
        "GDP growth for Q1 2012 was an upside surprise as exports recovered and public spending gained momentum.",
        "Meanwhile, available leading economic indicators likewise paint a generally positive picture in the period ahead.",
        "- Against this economic backdrop, there is scope to maintain current policy settings and allow the cumulative 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates and the operational adjustments in the reserve requirements earlier in the year to continue to work their way through the economy.",
        "Adequate liquidity and strong bank lending, spurred by prevailing low interest rates, should also help sustain domestic real sector activity.",
        "- The MB also noted that core inflation remains firm.",
        "Oil prices continue to show considerable volatility, while additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments provide potential upside influence on inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the weak global economy time of the policy meeting.",
        "A comprehensive set of economic information was provided by the Technical Secretariat of the Advisory Committee (AC).",
        "The AC is composed of the Governor of the BSP as Chairman and four members, namely: the Deputy Governor of the Monetary Stability Sector, the Deputy Governor of the Supervision and Examination Sector, the Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Sub-Sector, and the Assistant Governor of the Treasury Department.",
        "The highlights of the discussions on the 14 June 2012 meeting were approved by the Monetary Board during its regular meeting held on 28 June can contribute to a moderation in oil and other commodity prices.",
        "As such, inflationary pressures and the risk of second-round effects may also ease in the coming months.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation decelerated in May, driven mainly by lower inflation for non-food items, particularly electricity, LPG, kerosene, gasoline and diesel.",
        "Other indicators also reflected a downtrend, including the following: seasonally-adjusted month-on-month headline and core inflation, and the combined weight of abovethreshold CPI components.",
        "In contrast, year-on-year core inflation and the number of above-threshold items increased slightly, while the three alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP showed mixed trends.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations based on the BSP and private sector forecast surveys remained within the 3-5 percent target range over the policy horizon.",
        "Results of the May 2012 survey from the AP Consensus showed lower inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2013 compared to April.",
        "Meanwhile, results of the May 2012 BSP survey of private sector economists showed steady inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2014 and a slightly higher forecast for 2013.",
        "Similarly, the Q2 2012 business expectations survey indicated that the majority of respondents anticipating inflation to go up in the current survey quarter decreased.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - Despite the slight increase in the inflation forecast, the latest baseline forecasts continue to point to within-target inflation for 2012 and 2013.",
        "The slightly higher baseline forecasts relative to projections from the previous policy meeting on 19 April are due to the higher-than-forecast actual inflation for April as well as the higher-thanexpected increase in wages in the National Capital Region (NCR) for 2012.",
        "These adjustments offset the lower assumptions for oil prices and world GDP growth, the reduction in jeepney fares, as well as the exclusion of assumptions for transport fare adjustments for taxis and buses.",
        "- Weaker global economic activity represents the primary downside risk to inflation.",
        "A slowdown in global economic activity implies lower demand-pull pressures on commodity prices, as reflected in the moderation in oil prices in May.",
        "As such, the nearterm risk of second-round effects from a sustained uptrend in oil prices has diminished.",
        "- Nevertheless, upside inflation risks remain and underlying domestic price pressures appear to remain firm.",
        "At same time, oil prices continue to show considerable volatility while additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments continue to pose an upside risk to inflation.",
        "D. Demand conditions - The Philippine economy posted a higher-than-expected growth in Q1 2012 of 6.4 percent, as exports recovered and government spending gained momentum.",
        "Household consumption expenditures also remained a solid driver of growth.",
        "Meanwhile, on the production side, all major sectors grew, led by the services sector.",
        "- Available leading economic indicators likewise continued to advance.",
        "Energy and auto sales recorded gains, manufacturing activity as measured in the MISSI continues to expand while latest Philippine PMI readings indicate expansion for manufacturing, services, and retail and wholesale sectors.",
        "The book-to-bill ratio has remained above one since February 2012.",
        "Overall business confidence also appeared to be stronger in the second quarter though slightly less buoyant in the third quarter due to seasonal factors.",
        "- Meanwhile, the MB noted the increase in minimum wage in NCR which was approved allowance (COLA) under the previous wage order into the basic wage and provided additional COLA of P30 in the daily minimum wage of all private sector workers in the region which would be payable in two tranches.",
        "E. Supply-side indicators Developments in Agriculture - Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (AHFF) expanded in Q1 2012, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "The growth of AHFF was driven up by higher poultry, livestock, corn, and coconut production but was tempered by contractions in the production of sugarcane, rice and mango.",
        "Nevertheless, the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) projects rice and corn production to expand in the second and third quarters of 2012.",
        "The projected increase in rice output can be attributed to increased harvest area and yields with sufficient water supply and the “Five in Two” (five croppings within a period of two years) program of the government.",
        "Corn production will be supported by the expansion in harvest area and possible early plantings.",
        "- Favorable supply conditions have kept prices of meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables generally stable.",
        "Meanwhile, prices of refined sugar inched up in most trading centers due to increased demand during the summer season.",
        "- On the international front, the FAO food price index was lower in April after successive increases in the first quarter of 2012.",
        "This was caused largely by declines in sugar, dairy and cereal prices, which more than offset higher oils and meat prices.",
        "Oil Price Developments - Oil prices fell sharply in May after US crude oil inventories surged to their highest levels.",
        "Oil prices in the futures market likewise decreased.",
        "The release of weak employment data in the US and Europe also fanned concerns of lower oil demand in the near term.",
        "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) downward revision of its economic growth forecasts for the euro area and Fitch’s and Moody’s downgrades of Greece’s sovereign rating and of the long-term debt and deposit ratings of 16 Spanish banks, respectively, also dampened oil prices.",
        "- While a resurgence of upside pressures on world oil prices could not be fully discounted, latest futures price data suggest a modest easing in future spot prices.",
        "In turn, these developments are likely to have a favorable impact on domestic inflation.",
        "Local oil companies have already reduced local pump prices and the LTFRB ordered a rollback in the minimum fare of public utility jeepneys (PUJs).",
        "The LTFRB has also dismissed the petitions for fare adjustments by provincial and city bus companies.",
        "F. Financial market developments - As a result of deteriorating sentiment in global financial markets and higher risk aversion due to the debt crisis in Europe, the local equity market has retreated, the peso has depreciated, and spreads of ROPs over comparable US Treasuries, CDS spreads and EMBI spreads have widened since the previous review of the policy stance.",
        "On 31 May, the PSEi closed at 5,091.23 index points, lower by 2.1 percent from the previous month’s closing level.",
        "In May, the peso depreciated to average at P42.90/US$1 compared to the previous month’s level of P42.66/US$1.",
        "The EMBI+ Philippine spread similarly widened to 244 bps from end-April’s 198 bps while the Philippines 5-year sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spread rose to 195 bps from previous month’s end of 154 bps.",
        "G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions - Domestic liquidity or M3 expanded at a faster pace of 9.1 percent year-on-year in April from the 5.6-percent growth recorded a month earlier.",
        "Money supply growth continued to be driven by the sustained expansion of net foreign assets (NFA) at 9.3 percent in April.",
        "At the same time, net domestic assets (NDA) rebounded by 4.6 percent in April after contracting by 4.2 percent in the previous month due largely to the faster growth in net domestic credits, combined with a slower rise in the net other items account well as placements of authorized counterparties in the BSP SDA facility).",
        "- The growth of outstanding loans of commercial banks, net of banks’ reverse repurchase expansion of 18.7 percent.",
        "Loans for production activities—which comprised more than four-fifths of banks’ aggregate loan portfolio—grew by 19.7 percent in April from 19.3 percent a month earlier.",

        "Revenue collections increased by 11.4 percent while expenditure was higher by 12.1 percent.",
        "In the first four months of 2012, maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) increased by 41 percent while infrastructure spending grew by 49.7 percent.",
        "External developments - The world economy appeared to have lost some momentum since the previous policy meeting.",
        "The JP Morgan Global All-Industry Output Index fell from 54.4 in March to conditions in the euro area have continued to deteriorate, fueling uncertainty and posing downside risks to the rest of the world through trade and financial channels.",
        "- Advance estimates showed that GDP growth in the euro area was flat in Q1 2012 while the composite PMI for the euro area declined for a fourth month in a row from January rose to a 15-year high in April.",
        "- Despite recent gains, downside risks to the US growth outlook remain present.",
        "Potential spillovers from the euro area could continue to hamper US economic growth and employment gains, while the gridlock over a medium-term debt reduction plan continues to limit the scope for fiscal stimulus.",
        "Advance estimates showed that GDP growth was slower in Q1 2012 while US unemployment remained elevated in May at - China’s real GDP growth in Q1 2012 was much slower than the previous quarter and year-ago levels.",

        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that inflation will likely settle near the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range in 2012 and 2013, with a downward adjustment in the forecasted inflation path for 2012-2013 compared to the previous policy meeting.",
        "Consistent with the inflation forecast trajectory, inflation expectations based on the latest BSP and private sector surveys have remained well anchored.",
        "- Meanwhile, the MB noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook now leans slightly toward the upside as oil prices have remained elevated and at risk from ongoing tensions in the Middle East as well as strong demand from emerging economies.",
        "The pressures on oil prices constitute the main source of upside risk to the inflation outlook because of their adverse implications on inflation expectations and on the prices of other goods and services.",

        "Meanwhile, the weak global economy and the stable peso could provide a moderating effect on inflation.",

        "For the first two months of 2012, government spending accelerated, merchandise exports growth recovered while bank lending growth maintained its momentum.",
        "Recent indicators of global economic activity have also improved modestly, although sovereign debt concerns in Europe have continued to weigh down on the global outlook.",
        "The monetary policy easing undertaken since January combined with the adequate liquidity in the system and early disbursement by the NG to fast track government spending should give the economy enough room to continue to grow.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year average headline inflation has continued to slow down in March, driven mainly by lower inflation for non-food items, particularly power rates.",
        "Other price indicators also reflected a downtrend, including the following: the year-on-year core inflation, seasonally-adjusted month-on-month core inflation, three alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP, and the number and weight of abovethreshold items.",
        "- Food inflation also held steady as some food commodities showed slower price movement.",
        "In particular, slower increases in the prices of vegetables and sugar due to favorable domestic supply conditions, helped pull down inflation.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.",
        "Inflation expectations based on the BSP and private sector forecast surveys remain within the 3-5 percent target range over the policy horizon.",
        "Similarly, data from the latest business and consumer expectations surveys also showed an improved inflation outlook.",
        "Results from the Q1 2012 Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) indicated that consumers expect lower inflation over the next 12 months while findings from the Business Expectations Survey (BES) for Q1 2012 showed a smaller number of respondents anticipating inflation to move up in both the current and succeeding quarters.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - The latest baseline forecasts continue to point to within-target inflation for 2012 and compared to the previous policy meeting is attributed mainly to the lower-thanforecasted actual inflation in February and March which offset the impact of higher oil prices.",
        "- The MB also considered various alternative scenarios for the inflation forecast, taking into consideration both the upside and downside risks to inflation and possible second round effects from oil price shocks.",
        "Using these alternative scenarios, average inflation for 2012 and 2013 are expected to remain within target over the policy horizon.",
        "- However, the balance of risks appeared to have tilted to the upside.",
        "The uptrend in oil prices and the potential second-round effects that it could generate are the principal risks to future inflation.",
        "Moreover, additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments and sustained strong capital inflows could fuel inflationary pressures.",
        "- Meanwhile, the downside risks to inflation include continued uncertainty over the strength of the global economy and its implications on the pace of economic activity.",
        "At the same time, the broadly stable peso could help temper the prices of imported commodities.",
        "D. Demand conditions - There have been recent signs that domestic activity and exports have picked up.",
        "Merchandise exports grew for the first two months of 2012 as electronic exports recovered after 11 consecutive declines.",

        "- In addition, the MB noted that the FAO food price index was broadly stable in March after climbing for two consecutive months, with indices of cereals, sugar and meat prices remaining largely unchanged from last month’s level.",
        "Oil Price Developments - Oil prices advanced in March following US and Europe sanctions on Iran, which limited the country’s crude oil shipments, sustained strong demand from emerging markets, and the announcement by the US Fed that it would maintain a low interest environment to stimulate the US economy, raising speculation of increasing oil demand going forward.",

        "- Nevertheless, the Board also took into consideration the favorable inflation outlook and well-cemented inflation expectations in deciding to maintain the current policy settings.",
        "The latest BSP projections showed inflation staying within the target ranges of 4.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2010 and 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for expectations remained firmly anchored within the inflation targets over the policy horizon.",

        "The lower baseline forecasts also reflected the lower-than-expected wage adjustment in July 2010.",
        "The Board noted that, even with the downward shift in the forecast trajectory, which brought the average inflation projection close to the low-end of the target range for 2011, current policy settings were deemed appropriate.",
        "- At the same time, the Board considered that while global recovery is expected to continue, uncertainty over the strength and pace of the global economic recovery amid financial market tensions particularly in the euro area and signs that economic recovery in the US is losing steam could pose a downside risk to the domestic economy, warranting the need to keep current monetary settings steady.",

        "Electricity prices went up in November with the higher cost of power from the National Power Corporation (NPC) and the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM).",
        "The impact of higher global crude oil prices on the domestic pump prices of petroleum products led to higher inflation for transportation and communication services.",
        "Meanwhile, food prices were generally stable, particularly for meat and rice.",
        "- The official measure of core inflation was also slightly higher in November, driven mainly by the spike in electricity prices.",
        "Core inflation increased to 3.5 percent in November from 3.3 percent in October.",
        "- With the year-to-date average inflation at 3.8 percent as of November 2010, average inflation is expected to be within target for 2010.",
        "Inflation expectations - Various surveys continued to indicate well-contained inflation expectations over the policy horizon.",
        "The Asia Pacific consensus forecasts and the BSP’s survey of private sector economists showed within-target inflation forecasts for 2010-2011.",
        "Results of the Q4 2010 Business Expectations Survey (BES) likewise indicated that the number of respondents expecting higher inflation had decreased.",
        "Meanwhile, results of the Q4 2010 Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) showed that higher inflation is expected over the next 12 months.",

        "- The upside risks to future inflation include a potential rebound in oil prices given the continuing strong demand by emerging economies, additional increase in rice prices, potential increase in the price of other non-oil commodities, the impact of adverse weather conditions on agriculture, petitions for electricity rate adjustments, and a stronger-than-expected domestic economic recovery that could induce demand-side price pressures.",

        "In addition, the MB observed that conditions are ripe for rising inflationary pressures should the global economic recovery become more synchronized amid tight global supply response.",
        "The main challenge for the near term will be to contain the impact of continued cost-push pressures on wage- and price-setting behavior.",
        "Second-round effects from cost-push factors need to be monitored closely given the expected increases in the prices of certain basic goods.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation in January 2011 increased to 3.5 percent from the December 2010 level of 3.0 percent.",
        "Higher inflation in January was traced mainly to higher prices of food and energy items.",
        "These, in turn, were linked to increased prices in the international market in the case of petroleum products, and the impact of domestic weather conditions in the case of food items such as fish and fruits and vegetables.",
        "Higher energy distribution costs also contributed to the higher inflation rate for the month.",
        "These factors represent supply-side pressures on prices which, if sustained, could subsequently trigger second-round effects on demand.",
        "- Core inflation, which excludes some food and energy items to measure generalized price pressures, decreased to 3.3 percent in January 2011 from such as the net of volatile items, the trimmed mean, and the weighted median increased to 4.2 percent, 2.6 percent, and 2.1 percent from 4.1 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.8 percent, respectively.",
        "- The full year average inflation for 2010 registered at 3.8 percent, well within the target range of 4.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2010.",
        "Inflation expectations - Results of the Asia Pacific consensus forecasts as well as preliminary results of the BSP’s survey of private sector economists for January 2011 showed higher but within-target inflation forecasts for 2011-2012.",
        "Results of the Business Expectations Survey (BES) for Q4 2010 indicated that the majority of respondents that anticipate inflation to move up in the survey quarter decreased.",
        "Meanwhile, results of the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) for Q4 2010 indicated that higher inflation is expected over the next 12 months.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - The latest baseline forecasts indicate that 2011 and 2012 inflation will fall within the target range of 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point.",
        "- Compared to the previous forecast round, the baseline inflation forecasts are higher for both 2011 and 2012.",
        "The upward adjustment could be attributed to the higher-than-forecast inflation in December 2010 and January 2011 and the increase in oil prices.",
        "Moreover, the latest forecasts incorporate the estimated impact of the proposed hike in bus fares, the wage increase for government employees, further increase in NFA rice prices, pending water rate increases as well as the potential impact on domestic inflation of higher international prices of wheat and sugar.",
        "- The balance of risks to the inflation outlook has tilted further to the upside.",
        "Factors which may cause an upward shift in the inflation path include a sustained uptrend in oil prices, additional increases in rice prices, further increases in the global price of non-oil commodities, the impact of adverse weather conditions on agricultural output, and petitions for electricity rate increases.",
        "Meanwhile, a weaker global recovery could dampen external demand while a sustained strengthening of the peso should help temper the impact of imported inflation.",
        "Apart from the upside risks, the successive cost-side pressures stemming from the increases in administered prices (such as utility and transport charges), domestic pump prices, and the cost of other basic food items (e.g., bread and sugar), while already part of the central forecast scenario, nevertheless, still pose a risk to the inflation outlook as they could raise inflation expectations.",
        "D. Demand conditions - The economy continued to expand in Q4 2010.",
        "GDP grew by 7.1 percent year-on-year, bringing the annual growth to 7.3 percent for 2010.",
        "The national accounts data confirm the solid performance of domestic market oriented sectors such as construction and services.",
        "Investments also provided strong support to growth.",
        "Meanwhile, consistent with the strong pick-up in domestic demand and the normalization of global trade, industry outpaced the performance of services and agriculture.",
        "These indicate that domestic demand conditions are firm, supported by more optimistic business confidence readings in the first quarter of 2011.",
        "E. Supply-side indicators Developments in Agriculture - The agricultural sector recovered in Q4 2010, but not enough to offset the contractions in the previous quarters.",
        "Relative to the previous year, agricultural output declined in 2010, reflecting largely the adverse impact of El Niño.",
        "In the first semester of 2011, palay and corn output are expected to expand with improvements in harvest area and yields.",
        "Looking ahead, agricultural production is expected to be sustained by increased public spending on research and extension work and the adoption of strategies to counter the impact of weather-related disturbances.",
        "Latest weather reports indicated that a moderate-strength La Niña episode is still expected to persist until at least the March-May 2011 season across the tropical Pacific.",
        "- In the international market, the Food Agriculture Organization’s (FAO’s) latest estimate of world cereal production in 2010 stands slightly more than the previous forecast in November but is still below the 2009 estimate.",
        "The revision mostly reflected higher estimates for production in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Nigeria that have more than compensated for the reduced estimates for India and Kazakhstan.",
        "Despite the upward revision in the 2010 cereal production, the world supply and demand balance for cereals is still expected to tighten considerably.",
        "The tightening of the cereal market anticipated in the 2010/11 marketing year has already resulted in sharp increases in world prices of all major cereals in recent months.",
        "Oil Price Developments - The average price of Dubai crude oil increased further in December following the release of upbeat economic news in the US and Asia, supporting market expectations that global economic recovery will be sustained in 2011.",
        "The oil price uptrend was sustained in January with positive manufacturing reports in the US and the euro zone.",
        "Oil prices in the futures market also increased.",

        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - Retail electricity rates were lower in January due to the reduced price of electricity in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) as well as lower prices from independent power producers (IPPs) and the National Power Corporation (NPC).",
        "Likewise, transmission costs went down in January as Meralco completed the collection of transmission cost under-recoveries.",
        "The lower generation and transmission costs offset the increase in the distribution charges for 2011.",
        "F. Financial market developments Government Securities Market - During the 7 February 2011 auction, the interest rates for the 182-day and Meanwhile, the Auction Committee rejected all bids for the P1.0 billion offering of the 91-day T-bill.",
        "The rise in the rates of the 182-day and 364-day T-bills were due to inflation concerns following the higher inflation rate in January 2011 relative to December 2010, which prompted investors to bid high rates as they wanted to stay on the defensive side in anticipation of a possible upward adjustment in the BSP’s policy interest rates.",
        "- Secondary market yields and term spreads were higher across all tenors on 4 February 2011 relative to the 30 December 2010 level.",
        "The yields on GS in the secondary market are expected to continue their uptrend given market correction from the sharp decline in mid-November 2010 and as market players speculate on the recent comments made by the BSP, in particular, that it is ready to rein in inflation if needed.",
        "Selling continued in the secondary government securities market on concerns that rising fuel prices will contribute to inflationary pressures.",
        "Stock Market - Stock trading remained uneven in early-February 2011.",
        "The PSEi slid lower in the first trading day of the month as investors continued to ignore reports of a robust growth for the Philippine economy for the whole of 2010.",
        "However, the index rebounded on 2 February, boosted by positive developments in the civil strife in Egypt that also lifted the US markets.",
        "- The index is expected to continue to move sideways or lower in the coming weeks as investors search for drivers of growth for the local economy and corporate earnings.",
        "However, analysts are of the view that market activity will be more robust in 2011.",
        "Hence, the first quarter is essentially an opportunity for investors to accumulate attractive stocks.",
        "The promising industries are power, gaming, tourism, and mining.",
        "Foreign Exchange - In January 2011, the peso depreciated further due to investors’ move to cover for dollar-short positions ahead of US non-farm payroll data.",
        "For the period 1-2 February, however, the peso strengthened on stronger-thanexpected Philippine economic growth.",
        "On a year-to-date basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar by 0.3 percent on 2 February 2011 as it closed at P43.97/US$1, moving in tandem with the Thailand baht, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, and the Indonesian rupiah.",
        "Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads - In January, debt spread movements were mixed.",

        "Against neighboring economies, the Philippine CDS spread traded lower than Indonesia’s but wider than Malaysia’s and Thailand’s.",
        "G. Domestic liquidity and credit conditions - Domestic liquidity or M3 rose at a faster pace of 10.6 percent year-on-year in December from 7.5 percent in November.",
        "This brought the full-year (2010) average M3 growth rate to 9.7 percent.",
        "The faster growth in net foreign assets (NFA) of 17.7 percent in December from 14.9 percent in the previous month continued to drive the expansion in domestic liquidity.",
        "Similarly, net domestic assets (NDA) rose slightly by 0.4 percent in December from a contraction of 1.2 percent in the previous month as net domestic credits continued to expand.",
        "- Total outstanding loans of commercial banks, net of banks’ reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with the BSP, continued to expand in December by 8.9 percent, broadly similar to the previous month’s expansion of 9.0 percent.",

        "Latest projections from the IMF also show stronger global growth prospects for addition, the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update (January 2011) projects global economic activity to grow by 4.4 percent in 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point (ppt) for 2011 relative to the October 2010 WEO.",
        "The report also cited that economic growth in advanced economies is gaining some traction, with output projected to increase by 2.5 percent in 2011 and 2012.",
        "Meanwhile, the growth estimate in 2011 for emerging and developing economies was revised upward to 6.5 percent in 2011 and 2012.",
        "The Monetary Board (MB) decided to: a) Maintain the BSP’s policy rates at 4.5 percent for the overnight RRP b) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs); and c) Maintain the current reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - The MB’s decision to maintain the policy rates is based on its assessment that current monetary policy settings are appropriate given the latest inflation outlook and emerging economic developments.",
        "Latest average baseline forecasts show a lower inflation path, consistent with the 3-5 percent target range for 2011-2013.",
        "The within-target inflation outlook is also in line with the latest BSP and private sector surveys, which indicate declining and well-contained inflation expectations.",
        "- The MB also noted that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook over the policy horizon are slightly tilted to the downside.",
        "Since the previous policy meeting, the international growth outlook has become significantly more uncertain, while conditions in global financial markets have become highly unsettled, given interlocking sovereign debt and banking concerns in Europe and the prospects of stalled economic recovery in the United States.",
        "As a result, demand-side factors driving global commodity prices have abated.",
        "Nevertheless, the MB continues to be mindful of the remaining upside risks, including potential increases in liquidity due to sustained capital inflows.",
        "- At the same time, the MB is of the view that monetary easing may not be warranted for the time being as domestic demand remains firm.",

        "- The MB also considered the current settings of monetary policy to be well-placed, given the evolving global and domestic economic conditions.",
        "In particular, domestic economic growth could be tempered by the slowdown in the global recovery and the weaker-than-expected domestic public spending.",
        "Thus, with manageable inflationary pressures amid prospects of slower global recovery, there is scope for the BSP to pause and assess the outlook for inflation and growth as further information becomes available from the domestic and international fronts.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation rose in September, driven mainly by higher inflation for food, particularly fruits and vegetables.",
        "Other indicators also reflected a slight uptick, including the following: the year-on-year core inflation, seasonally-adjusted month-on-month headline inflation, two out of three alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP, and the number and weight of above-threshold items.",
        "Meanwhile, the seasonally-adjusted month-on-month core inflation was unchanged.",
        "- The MB, however, noted that the upticks in the headline and core inflation numbers in September were due mainly to temporary weather-related food price shocks, which are not expected to lead to broad-based inflationary pressures.",
        "In particular, core inflation, which eliminates the volatility caused by food and energy prices, has remained relatively subdued since July.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations appear to be well contained, staying within the target band for Pacific Consensus Survey showed lower and within-target inflation forecasts for C. Inflation outlook - The latest baseline inflation projections are on a lower path relative to the previous policy meeting, with average headline inflation rates for 2011-2013 projected to settle within the 3-5 percent inflation target range.",
        "The downward adjustment in the forecast path could be attributed mainly to lower oil price assumptions.",
        "- The balance of risks to inflation appears to be skewed slightly to the downside.",
        "The downside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified due to concerns over the strength of the global economy and its implication on the pace of economic activity and oil demand.",
        "At the same time, the broadly stable peso could help temper the prices of imported commodities.",
        "Meanwhile, the upside risks to inflation could emanate from the liqudity impact of strong capital inflows, pending and any additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments, and possible higher global rice prices.",
        "D. Demand conditions - While renewed uncertainty over the strength and pace of the global economic recovery could continue to pose downside risks to the domestic economy, most recent demand indicators suggest that domestic demand appears to be intact.",
        "Results of the Q3 2011 Consumer Expectations Survey showed an improvement for the current quarter while outlook turned bullish for the next quarter and the year ahead.",
        "Latest survey on industrial activity also indicates that the largest proportion of the establishments in the manufacturing sector operated consistently above 80 percent.",

        "Meanwhile, vehicle sales, particularly for passenger cars, slightly recovered in August after being affected by supply disruptions with the disaster in Japan earlier this year.",
        "E. Supply-side indicators Developments in Agriculture - After growing robustly in the first half of 2011, the production outlook on agriculture could be lower in the second half due to the series of typhoons that hit the country.",
        "In particular, the production losses due to typhoons Pedring and Quiel are expected to affect the domestic supply outlook for rice.",
        "- Meanwhile, the MB noted that agriculture damages due to severe flooding, particularly in Thailand, may threaten global rice supply.",
        "Amid these concerns, Thailand reportedly raised the support price of rice for local farmers.",
        "- Given this supply outlook, the MB is of the view that there is a need for timely government-to-government negotiation to step up the country’s rice inventory.",
        "Oil Price Developments - The impact of a slower global recovery on oil demand has already been reflected in the slight pullback in international oil prices.",
        "After recovering slightly in September, oil prices have declined on reports of increased downside risks to the US economy as well as greater risk aversion in financial markets.",
        "Over the near term, the outlook for crude oil prices remains generally weighted towards the downside as persistent fears from the EU debt crisis and signs that global growth is slowing are likely to keep crude oil prices under pressure.",
        "Developments in the Utilities Sector - Lower generation costs offset the increase in the universal charge2 component of the electricity bill in September.",
        "Meralco noted that the decrease was primarily due to the lower charges by some Independent Power Producers (IPPs) due to improved utilization levels.",

        "In October, investors maintained a cautious outlook, following Moody’s downgrade of Italy’s credit rating for the first time in two decades.",

Domestic liquidity and credit conditions - Domestic liquidity or M3 grew at a faster pace of 9.4 percent in August 2011 from meanwhile, decreased further by 10.6 percent in August from the 6.3 percent contraction in July, given the faster expansion in the net other items account (which includes, among other things, revaluation and capital and reserve accounts as well as SDA placements of trust entities).",
        "However, net domestic credits expanded further by 8.9 percent with the sustained increase in credits extended to the private sector petition to recover through the Universal Charge (UC) the shortfalls in the Missionary Electrification (ME) subsidy for calendar years 2003 to 2009. by 14.9 percent, consistent with the continued strong growth of bank lending to businesses and households.",

        "Corporate bond issuances for the same period also increased by almost P18 billion to P142 billion.",
        "H. Fiscal developments - The fiscal deficit in January-July 2011 was P43.71 billion, 81.0 percent lower than the P229.4 billion deficit during the same period last year.",
        "The lower deficit figure is attributed to increased revenue collections (13.5 percent year-on-year) coupled with lower government spending (-10.0 percent year-on-year).",
        "External developments - The global growth outlook has become significantly more uncertain since the previous policy meeting.",
        "Global economic recovery appeared to weaken further as growing downside risks continued to erode market confidence.",

        "The Monetary Board (MB) decided to: a) Raise the regular reserve requirement by 1 percentage point effective b) Maintain the BSP’s policy interest rates at 4.50 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 6.50 percent for the overnight RP c) Maintain the current interest rates on term RRPs, RPs and SDAs.",
        "Key Considerations in the Formulation of the Monetary Policy Stance - The MB considered the increase in the reserve requirement on 24 June 2011 as a preemptive move to counter any additional inflationary pressures from excess liquidity.",
        "The MB believed that additional monetary measures are necessary given that expectations of continued strong capital inflows, driven by positive market sentiment over the favorable prospects for the Philippine economy, could fuel domestic liquidity growth and contribute to inflation risks.",
        "- The MB is of the view that, due to its mandatory nature, the increase in the RR ratio could strengthen the transmission of monetary policy changes to the real economy.",
        "- In deciding to maintain policy rates, the MB took into account the latest baseline forecasts, which showed a lower path relative to the forecast path of previous meeting on the monetary policy stance.",
        "Inflation expectations have also shown some signs of leveling off.",

        "- However, the MB noted that, despite the deceleration in future inflation readings, risks to the inflation outlook remain.",
        "In particular, the MB agreed that while the movements of global commodity prices have moderated, there is some uncertainty as to whether the easing of price pressures will be sustained given structural supply constraints and expectations of solid demand by emerging economies.",
        "As a result, inflation expectations could be susceptible to commodity price volatility.",
        "Further action, therefore, will be taken as needed in the subsequent reviews of the monetary policy stance given the continued risks to inflation expectations and prospects of secondround effects.",
        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - Year-on-year headline inflation was higher in May at 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent (revised) in the previous month.",
        "Inflation pressures in May were due mainly to the increase in non-food inflation, particularly higher year-on-year inflation for light.",
        "Higher rice prices due to crop damages wrought by Typhoon Chedeng also contributed to the uptick in inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, lower prices of fruits and vegetables tempered headline inflation in May as domestic supply remained adequate.",
        "Lower global prices of oil and subsequent rollbacks in the prices of petroleum products were also reflected in the lower or steady inflation outturns for fuel and transport and communication services.",
        "This helped dampened inflation pressures as well.",
        "- Likewise, core inflation, which excludes certain food and energy items to measure generalized price pressures, was also higher in May at 3.7 percent compared with 3.3 percent (revised) in April.",
        "All alternative measures of core inflation estimated by the BSP also posted increases in May.",
        "Inflation expectations - Inflation expectations for 2011 have remained elevated but appear to be leveling off and are within target.",
        "The latest surveys of private sector forecasts show expected inflation for 2011 reaching the upper limit of the target range.",
        "Nonetheless, the surveys show mean forecasts for 2012 to be either lower or unchanged relative to data as of the previous meeting.",
        "C. Inflation outlook - Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the 2011 average inflation could be slightly above the target range of 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point while the 2012 inflation could settle within the same target range.",
        "However, compared to the future readings considered at the previous policy meeting, the projected inflation path is now lower due to updates reflecting the lower actual inflation in April and May, reduction in international and domestic oil prices, slower domestic GDP growth, and the lower-than-assumed nominal wage adjustments.",
        "The cumulative 50-basis point hike in the BSP’s policy rate also contributed to the decline in the latest forecast path.",
        "- The balance of risks to the inflation outlook remained skewed to the upside.",
        "Commodity prices have moderated but will continue to pose a risk to the inflation outlook as structurally strong demand from emerging economies could exacerbate supply constraints.",

        "Recent Developments and Inflation Outlook The MB considered the following developments in coming up with its policy decision: A.",
        "Domestic price conditions - In February, headline and core inflation posted the highest month-on-month increase since July 2008 on both a seasonally adjusted and unadjusted basis.",
        "Higher inflation in February was traced mainly to the increase in food inflation, particularly for fruits and vegetables due to crop damage from continuous heavy rains during the month, particularly in Mindanao.",
        "At the same time, inflation for services also accelerated due to increases in the domestic prices of petroleum products, largely influenced by rising imported crude oil prices, and the recent hikes in transport fares.",
        "- Other indicators also reflected the uptrend: official and alternative core inflation measures increased in February, suggesting that broad-based inflationary pressures were building up.",
        "Inflation expectations - Mean inflation forecasts of private analysts polled by the BSP and the Asia Pacific Consensus surveys showed higher but within-target inflation forecasts for 2011.",

        "Upside risks to future inflation include higher global food and oil prices, a possible further increase in rice prices, the impact of adverse weather conditions on agriculture, higher-than-expected wage adjustments, and petitions for electricity rate hikes.",
        "On the other hand, the downside risks to inflation could continue to arise from the slow recovery of global growth and a sustained strengthening of the peso which could help temper the impact of imported inflation.",
        "D. Demand conditions - Growth will likely remain firm, supported by solid domestic demand conditions.",
        "The latest results of the BSP’s business cycle model showed a sustained upturn in domestic economic activity with five out of eight BSP leading and coincident indicators pointing to a continued economic expansion.",
        "In addition, results of the Q1 2011 Business Expectations Survey showed that business optimism continued to be strong for the current quarter outlook.",
        "Business outlook for the next quarter was more bullish, rising to a new all-time high.",

        "Foreign Exchange - Despite the tensions in the Middle-East and North Africa, the sustained inflows from net portfolio investments and FDI remained the key drivers of the peso’s strength.",
        "However, investors’ move to cover dollar-short positions amid higher oil prices weighed down on the peso.",

        "Global Bond and Credit Default Swap Spreads - For the period February-March, debt spreads generally widened as the spreading unrest in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region exerted upward pressure on oil prices.",

        "Net domestic assets (NDA), on the other hand, contracted by 4.2 percent in January from a growth of 0.4 percent in December 2010.",

        "- The latest baseline inflation projections are on a lower path relative to that from the previous policy meeting, with average headline inflation rates for The downward adjustment in the forecast path could be attributed mainly to the lower-than-projected inflation outturn for July and August 2011, slower liquidity growth, lower domestic output expansion, and decline in global growth.",
        "The slowdown in the forecasted liquidity growth reflects the impact of the 2.0-percentage point increase in the reserve requirement and the 50basis point hike in the BSP’s policy rates since March.",

A policy rate reduction is not expected to lead to significant exchange market volatility, since the interest rate differential will simply revert to levels before the US policy move; would remain positive in favor of the peso and thus it would not endanger the government’s inflation goal.",
        "On the other hand, the Monetary Board cited the following arguments in favor in keeping policy rates steady: a.",
        "The significant extent of monetary easing since December 2000 and the resulting ample liquidity in the financial system should give the economy ample room to expand without the need for further monetary stimulus.",
        "The best approach to the problem of weak credit demand may simply be to allow enough time for previous easing to work its way through the real sector.",

        "Although these numbers are far from constituting a trend, they could nevertheless signal the beginning of a recovery in bank lending.",
        "d. Although the widening breach of the 2002 target deficit was not expected to pose immediate problems for macroeconomic management, the possibility of increased government borrowing in 2003 could emerge as a considerable concern for the inflation outlook.",
        "e. Maintaining BSP policy rates at their current levels could lead to a wider interest rate differential that could allow for more room to maneuver in case a foreign exchange market pressure develop over the near term that could threaten the inflation target.",
        "Based on the analysis of data that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Board on 23 October 2002 and a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and inflationary expectations, the members of the Monetary Board by a unanimous vote decided as follows: a. to maintain the BSP’s policy rates at the current levels of 7.0 percent for the overnight RRP (borrowing) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP (lending) rate; b. to maintain the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the BSP under the RRP and SDA windows; c. to maintain the current interest rates on the term RRPs, RPs, and SDAs; and d. to maintain the reserve requirements at their current levels given the adequate level of liquidity in the system.",

        "In general, the real lending rate—measured as the difference between the low-end of the range of banks’ lending rates and the inflation rate—of most Asian countries declined due to the faster rate of decline in banks’ lending rate relative to inflation across the region.",

        "Instead, the liquidity that would be freed up by a reduction in liquidity reserves could find its way back to the BSP through higher placements under the reverse repurchase (RRP) and special deposit accounts (SDAs) or banks could take excessively long positions in US dollar which could increase speculative activity in the foreign exchange market instead of the “freed funds” being channeled into the productive sectors of the economy.",

        "increase in the BSP’s policy rates and other monetary tightening measures during periods of exchange market pressure should be used with considerable caution as these could also introduce greater uncertainty in an environment already marked by geopolitical tensions from the US-Iraq war and generalized weakness in global economic activity.",

        "open economies such as the Philippines typically face the difficult question of how best to respond to movements in the exchange rate, since they affect not only inflation through import prices but also inflationary expectations and output.",
        "They emphasized that depending on the shock, exchange rate changes may have very different implications for monetary conditions and hence for the setting of the monetary policy stance.",
        "In this regard, the Monetary Board’s view was that the recent shocks in the exchange rate were largely temporary.",
        "They believed that the movements are not structural and therefore, are not persistent in nature.",
        "Rather, these shocks have been caused by reduced foreign exchange inflows, increased demand for dollars arising largely from negative market sentiment and to some extent, excess peso liquidity finding its way to the foreign exchange market.",
        "Under these circumstances, the members of the Monetary Board stressed that countering the effects of these largely supply-side shocks may not necessarily be desirable.",
        "Likewise, they argued that if their impact on inflation is only temporary, countermeasures through adjustments in interest rates could only inject more uncertainty on real economic activity.",
        "Lifting the Tiering Scheme on Banks’ Placements with the on consumer prices arising from sustained pressure on the peso, the Monetary Board was of the view that the tiering scheme could be lifted.",
        "This could also help temper speculative demand for foreign exchange arising from excess liquidity in the system.",
        "In particular, this measure would slow down the observed unwinding of banks’ placements with the BSP under the RRP window, which could be used to fund speculative demand for foreign exchange.",
        "This measure was also adopted by the BSP in August 2001 to help quell the speculative pressures on the peso.",
        "c. Adjustment in the Liquidity Reserve Requirement increase in liquidity reserves could help mitigate the pressure against the peso coming from peso borrowings to fund foreign exchange acquisitions.",
        "They pointed out that such a measure is not expected to significantly affect banks’ lending rates since liquidity reserves are paid market interest rates.",
        "The members of the Monetary Board noted that this measure was adopted during the height of the Asia currency crisis as the liquidity reserves were raised to 8 percent on 29 August 1997 from only 2 percent on 4 July 1997.",
        "This was aimed at tempering the extreme volatility of the domestic currency during the period.",
        "The Monetary Board also noted that changes in the level of the liquidity reserves should be reviewed and adjusted as soon as conditions in the foreign exchange market normalize.",
        "with the BSP’s shift to inflation targeting, adjustments in policy rates are not aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate _per se but at_ addressing emerging inflationary pressures arising from sustained exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Given that the near-term risks to the inflation outlook appear to be largely contained and that the expected inflation pass-through appears to be relatively low at present, the Monetary Board decided that an outright increase in the BSP’s policy rates does not appear to be warranted at present.",
        "At the same time, they noted the relative absence of demand-side influences on the outlook for inflation and growth supported the arguments for ensuring that liquidity conditions remained appropriate for the domestic economy’s requirements.",
        "Likewise, they expressed the view that the combination of a subdued outlook for future inflation and the lack of clear-cut signs of a sustained upturn in domestic demand implied that the balance of risks in the current economic environment was weighed towards economic weakness rather than a sustained rise in inflation.",

        "The members of the Monetary Board noted that the alternative to active stimulus is one that emphasizes caution in the face of uncertainty and involves keeping policy interest rates unchanged.",
        "The following arguments were raised by the members of the Monetary Board in favor of a cautious stance: a. the outlook for 2004 inflation suggested that average inflation will be in line with the target, implying that monetary tightening may not be necessary; b. there continued to be evidence of sufficient liquidity to fuel the economy’s growth requirements, hence, further easing may not be necessary; and c. the monetary policy stance should be sufficiently cautious to guard against any possible renewed price pressures that may emerge over the near term.",
