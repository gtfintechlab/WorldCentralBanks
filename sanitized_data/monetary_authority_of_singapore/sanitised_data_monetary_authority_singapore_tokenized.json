        "In April 2013, MAS maintained the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its slope, width, and the level at which it was centred.",
        "This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2012, has helped to alleviate inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations, as well as facilitate the restructuring of the economy.",
        "S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER) Over the last six months, the S$NEER remained in the upper half of the policy band.",
        "It experienced some volatility, mainly reflecting market reactions to the prospective tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve.",
        "More recently, the S$NEER appreciated on account of the relative weakness of regional currencies against the US$, as well as the Fed’s decision in mid-September to defer tapering.",
        "With global monetary conditions still accommodative, the domestic three-month interbank rate has remained low, averaging 0.40% from April through September 2013.",
        "FOR 2013 AND 2014 The Singapore economy is projected to grow modestly for the rest of 2013 and into 2014 as the external environment continues to improve, notwithstanding intermittent turbulence in financial markets.",
        "Following the strong performance in Q2 2013, economic activity contracted sequentially in Q3 but should resume an expansion trend in the quarters ahead.",
        "Headline and core inflation have stayed low in recent months.",
        "However, they have picked up in the latest readings and may continue to rise in the next few quarters, as accumulated business costs pass through to consumer prices alongside the cyclical uplift in economic activity.",
        "According to the Advance Estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, Singapore’s GDP contracted by 1.0% in Q3 2013 on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, following the 16.9% surge in Q2.",
        "The financial services sector shrank as equity and foreign exchange market activities fell on concerns over a reduction in the pace of asset purchases by the Fed and the threat of military intervention in Syria.",
        "The manufacturing sector also posed a drag on GDP growth, with overall industrial production declining sequentially in July and August 2013 due to weakness in the electronics and pharmaceutical industries.",
        "Incoming data suggests that the recovery in the global economy is continuing, although there remain uncertainties, including those associated with the recurring fiscal impasse in the US and potentially disorderly market adjustments to the Fed’s tapering of asset purchases.",
        "The for the G3 is underpinned by the gradual revival in labour and housing markets in the US, expansionary macroeconomic policies in Japan, and improvements in business sentiment in the Eurozone.",
        "These developments should support global activity even as GDP growth in China stabilises at a sustainable level.",
        "Most other Asian economies have thus far withstood the recent bouts of financial market volatility and the tightening of financial conditions, and are taking policy measures to sustain growth.",
        "Meanwhile, the upturn in global GDP growth will buttress the incipient recovery of the global IT industry in 2014.",
        "Singapore’s external-oriented sectors are thus expected to see a modest uplift, while the domestic-driven sectors, such as construction, healthcare and education services, remain resilient.",
        "Overall GDP growth is projected at 2.5-3.5% in 2013, and is unlikely to be significantly different in 2014.",
        "The labour market should remain at full employment.",
        "Imported price pressures have been muted, given moderate inflation in Singapore’s major trade partners, notwithstanding the rise in oil prices in recent months.",
        "In comparison, domestic inflationary pressures have picked up as businesses pass on more of accumulated cost increases to consumer prices, following the relatively weak pass-through in earlier quarters.",
        "As a result, MAS Core Inflation, which excludes private road transport and accommodation costs, edged up to 1.8% y-o-y in August, from 1.6% in the first seven months of the year.",
        "Reflecting the recovery in COE premiums, CPI-All Items inflation rose to 1.9% in July-August, from 1.6% in Q2 2013.",
        "While global demand conditions will strengthen, spare production capacity in the advanced economies and ample supply buffers in commodity markets should keep a lid on imported inflation.",
        "However, the pass-through of domestic costs to prices of consumer services could intensify, given the rising cost pressures firms are facing from business rentals, COE premiums for commercial vehicles, and labour costs.",
        "The unemployment rate should stay below its historical average, alongside slowing labour force growth.",
        "MAS Core Inflation is expected to be 1.5-2% in 2013 and rise to 2-3% in 2014.",
        "Imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation will increase at a slower pace with the greater supply of housing coming on stream.",
        "COE premiums could continue to rise in the short term as the market adjusts to the pending re-categorisation of COEs.",
        "However, the increases are unlikely to be sustained at the same pace.",
        "For 2013, CPI-All Items inflation is projected to come in at the upper half of the 2-3% forecast range.",
        "At the Annual Report 2012/13 Press Conference on 23 July 2013, MAS revised the forecast for CPI-All Items inflation for 2013 down to 2-3%, from 3-4% at the April 2013 Statement, in view of the sharp fall in car prices following the announcement of financing restrictions on motor vehicle loans.",
        "For 2014, the forecast for CPI-All Items inflation is similar to that for MAS Core Inflation, at 2-3%.",
        "The Singapore economy should continue to expand for the rest of 2013 and into 2014, although some volatility in growth rates is likely.",
        "There are short-term uncertainties in the external environment, and MAS is closely monitoring economic and financial developments.",
        "Barring a significant deterioration in global demand conditions, the labour market will remain tight, and exert further upward pressures on MAS Core Inflation as firms pass on accumulated costs to consumer prices.",
        "MAS will therefore maintain its policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.",
        "There will be no change to the slope of the policy band, and the level at which it is centred.",
        "The present width of the band is sufficient to accommodate temporary fluctuations in the S$NEER, and will be kept unchanged.",
        "This policy stance is assessed to be appropriate, taking into account the balance of risks between external demand uncertainties and rising domestic inflationary pressures.",
        "In October 2012, MAS maintained the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its slope, width, and the level at which it was centred.",
        "This policy stance was deemed appropriate for containing inflationary pressures amid the ongoing economic restructuring.",
        "S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER) The S$NEER has continued to fluctuate in the upper half of the policy band over the last six months.",
        "The broad-based decline in the Japanese yen led to upward pressure on the S$NEER, although a strengthening in the US dollar, due to speculation of an early exit from quantitative easing in the US and renewed uncertainty over the European debt crisis, resulted in bouts of domestic currency weakness.",
        "With persistently low interest rates worldwide, the domestic three-month interbank rate has remained generally stable at 0.38% since December 2011.",
        "Singapore’s GDP is expected to grow by 1-3% in 2013.",
        "While the economy experienced some consolidation in the first three months of 2013, it should see a gradual improvement for the rest of the year, on the back of a recovery in external demand.",
        "CPI-All Items inflation is expected to come in at 3-4%.",
        "Although MAS Core Inflation is forecast at 1.5-2.5% for the year as a whole, it is expected to rise moderately in the latter half, reflecting persistent tightness in the labour market.",
        "According to the Advance Estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, Singapore’s GDP declined by 1.4% in Q1 2013 on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, following an increase of 3.3% in Q4 2012.",
        "Industrial production data for the first two months of the year showed that the contraction in the manufacturing sector was mainly confined to the biomedical and transport engineering clusters.",
        "Electronics production, which had experienced three consecutive quarters of decline, picked up modestly in January-February.",
        "Other sectors, such as financial services and construction, helped to buttress overall economic activity.",
        "The for the world economy has improved since late last year, although uncertainties remain, particularly with regard to Europe.",
        "The recovery in the G3 as a whole will be underpinned by the gradual pickup in the housing market and private demand in the US, as well as the fiscal stimulus in Japan.",
        "At the same time, economic activity in China will be sustained on the back of robust domestic demand, and the rest of Asia will see continued moderate growth.",
        "These developments should also provide a modest lift to the global IT industry, following a contraction in 2012.",
        "Singapore’s manufacturing sector and export-oriented services industries should improve gradually over the course of the year.",
        "Domestic-driven sectors, such as construction and related financing and real estate activities, will remain resilient.",
        "The level of output in the economy will further converge to its underlying potential, while the labour market remains at full employment, in part reflecting supply-side constraints.",
        "Imported price pressures have been generally mild in recent months, given favourable supply conditions in commodity markets and the cumulative impact of the S$NEER appreciation.",
        "While domestic costs have risen amid a tight labour market, their pass-through to consumer prices has to date been subdued.",
        "MAS Core Inflation, which excludes private road transport and accommodation costs, receded to 1.5% y-o-y in January-February 2013, from 2.0% and 2.4% in Q4 and Q3 2012, respectively.",
        "Over the same period, CPI-All Items inflation averaged around 4%.",
        "There was significant volatility in the monthly readings, mainly from the sharp swings in COE premiums.",
        "Looking ahead, supply buffers in the energy and food commodity markets should cap imported inflation.",
        "However, continuing tightness in the labour market will add to domestic cost pressures, resulting in a slightly stronger pace of cost pass-through to prices of consumer services.",
        "On balance, for the whole of 2013, MAS is lowering its forecast for Core Inflation from 2-3% to 1.5-2.5%, largely reflecting the weaker-than-expected price increases over the past few months.",
        "Imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation will increase at a slower pace given the upcoming completion of a large number of private housing units.",
        "COE premiums have corrected from the high in early 2013, following MAS’ tightening of financing restrictions on motor vehicle loans.",
        "Although COE premiums could fluctuate as the market continues to adjust to the policy measures, its contribution to CPI-All Items inflation is likely to be lower, and overall inflation should recede from its Q1 high.",
        "For the year as a whole, CPI-All Items inflation is expected to come in at 3-4%, down from 3.5-4.5% projected previously.",
        "More than half of overall inflation in 2013 will be accounted for by imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation and car prices.",
        "The Singapore economy should experience a modest pace of expansion in 2013.",
        "The tightness in the labour market will exert some upward pressures on MAS Core Inflation in the latter half of this year as higher wage costs pass through to consumer prices.",

Other measures of core inflation, which exclude components that exhibit excessive price volatility from the CPI basket, also showed increases ranging from 0.4-0.9% in 2000.",

        "The surge in oil prices had resulted in petrol prices being raised on five occasions, and electricity tariffs on three occasions in 2000, while the prices of meat, water and tobacco rose because of administrative decisions Meat prices were affected by the compulsory installation of meat-chillers, which raised prices of meat processed locally.",
        "In addition, import prices of pork rose as the ban on live pigs from Malaysia, which had previously been our largest source of pork, resulted in a switch towards imports of more expensive processed pork from countries like Australia and the United States.",
