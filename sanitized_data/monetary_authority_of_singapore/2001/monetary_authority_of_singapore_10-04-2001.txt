The recent weakness of the Singapore dollar, especially against the US dollar, has prompted speculation that MAS has shifted its policy stance on the exchange rate. This is not so. MAS manages the Singapore dollar exchange rate against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, and not against any single currency. MAS has not changed its policy of allowing a gradual, modest appreciation of the trade-weighted Singapore dollar within a policy band, as stated in the MAS Statement of Feb 2001. Although the trade-weighted S$ has weakened since then, it has remained within the policy band. MAS stands ready to intervene if necessary to keep it within the band. MAS will review its policy stance in July, and will be making a statement on then.
