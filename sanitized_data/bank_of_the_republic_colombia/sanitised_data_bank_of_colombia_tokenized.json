    "2013": [
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on May 31, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and full-time co-directors Messrs.  Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached     AND SITUATIONBackgrounda.",
        "Recent Developments in Inflation:Consumer inflation in April was 2.02% which is 10 basis points (bp) above what was seen in March.",
        "The surge in annual inflation was concentrated in food and regulated prices as was anticipated.The annual variation in the CPI for food rose for the second consecutive month and went to 1.6%, which is 20 bp more than it was in March.",
        "The upward pressure comes from perishable food (the annual change went from -1.9% in March to 0.4% in April).",
        "The annual rise in prices for processed food, in turn, was low in magnitude again.",
        "This could be related to the relative stability that international prices for grain, oil and oleaginous products showed at the end of last year and the beginning of the current one.In the CPI excluding food, the increase in the prices for regulated items, which saw an annual change of 0.9% last month (70 bp higher than in March), stands out.",
        "This surge occurred in the fees for electricity.",
        "The other components of this group –transportation, gas, natural gas– declined.With respect to the other components of the CPI excluding food, the annual change for tradable in April was 0.98%, which implied a drop of 15 bp in comparison to March.",
        "The prices for a significant number of durable consumer goods, including cars, continued falling just as they have been for several quarters.",
        "Since the depreciation of the peso in the last few months has been moderate, its transmission to consumer prices has been limited.",
        "The annual variation for non-tradables, in turn, not show significant changes but rather remained at 3.8%.",
        "Its main component, the sub-basket for rent, also remained at that level.In April, the indicators of core inflation showed few changes.",
        "The average for all of them was at 2.48%, 4 bp below the datum for the previous month and the lowest level since October 2010.The annual change in the PPI remained in negative territory in April (-2.4%) due to the decline in the local component (produced and consumed) since the imported component rose.",
        "The latter is related to the depreciation of the peso.With respect to inflation expectations, the different measurements are at or below the 3% target.",
        "The expectation data obtained through the Bank’s monthly survey for the end of the year dipped slightly to 2.5% while the expectation for 12 months went to 3.0% (thus rising a little with respect to what had been registered in the previous survey).",
        "Meanwhile, the estimates for the TES at horizons of 2, 3, and 5 years continued to fluctuate between 2.6% and 2.8% during April and the first three weeks of May    GrowthThe latest information on the performance of the economy in the first quarter of 2013 suggests that this slowed down in comparison to what had been seen at the end of last year as was predicted in earlier reports.",
        "The indicators for that period are influenced by the lower number of working days in February and March.In the first quarter of the year, household consumption grew at rates that were slightly lower than the ones registered in the fourth quarter of 2012.",
        "According to the figures from the Retail Monthly Sample ( in Spanish) published by DANE in March, the annual growth of sales was 0.9% in the first quarter (less than the 3.3% for the last quarter of 2012).",
        "This performance could be explained by an annual drop in the sales of vehicles (-11.4%).",
        "In contrast, sales of other goods grew 4.0% in the first three months of the year.A slowdown was also seen in imports of consumer goods in dollars.",
        "Between January and March 2013, they expanded at an annual rate of 3.3%, which is lower than what was registered for the last quarter of 2012 (15.4%).",
        "This growth was affected by the performance of the imports of durable consumer goods, which grew 1.6% during this period after having registered 11.2% in the fourth quarter.",
        "From this data, the conclusion can be drawn that the consumption of non-durable and semidurable goods and services continued expanding at rates similar to those seen towards the end of last year while in the durable goods segment, there was a marked slowdown.Regarding investment, the information on imports of capital goods shows that this item shrank in March (-6.7% annual growth).",
        "This also points to lower investment in areas other than housing construction and public works.Exports in dollars, in turn, registered a fall of 20% in March with respect to the same month last year (it went from US$5.712 billion to US$4.567 billion).",
        "Sales abroad for the main groups declined as follows: mining, 22.3% annually; agriculture, 24.2%; and industry, 9.4%.With regards to the supply indicators, the news shows mixed performance.",
        "Production of coffee continues to expand at favorable rates.",
        "Energy related mining showed positive growth in petroleum production while coal production was affected by labor problems and environmental penalties.",
        "The industrial sector registered significant deterioration during the quarter.",
        "In March, the index of industrial production excluding threshing shrank 11.5% in annual terms.",
        "Based on this rate, industrial production showed an annual contraction of 6.0% in the first quarter.",
        "This figure is the lowest that has been seen for an entire quarter since 2009.",
        "Given what was previously stated, it is not considered necessary to revise the growth forecasts for the first quarter.",
        "A large part of the slowdown had already been anticipated and was incorporated into the forecast for the financial period  which took into account the lower number of working days in the first quarter.",
        "That being the case, the predicted range remains between 2.0% and 3.5%.",
        "This result assumes a positive performance for public consumption and the investment in public works projects.The information for the second quarter of 2013 is scarce and is available only for April.",
        "Some of the data suggest a recovery in the expansion of economic activity.",
        "In the area of demand, consumer confidence rebounded significantly in April from the levels registered in February and March, and it rose above its historical average again.",
        "This strength was due to some better economic expectations in the medium and long term on the part of households.",
        "According to the information published by Econometria, in turn, vehicle sales registered a positive annual growth in April (3.3%) after the sharp drops in previous months (-18.5% on average for the first quarter).In the area of supply, the indicators available for the month of April showed an improvement.",
        "In the case of industry, the indicators of purchase orders and inventory improved significantly according to the Fedesarrollo survey.",
        "Nonetheless, the trend component continues to suggest a deterioration.",
        "Likewise in April, the indicator for production expectations as of three months also rose and the drop in the trend component halted.",
        "Nevertheless, it is advisable to wait for new information to confirm any change in the trend for this series.The merchants consulted by Fedesarrollo, in turn, reported a slight improvement in the current and future outlook for their sales in April.",
        "However, the trend component continues to show a weakening in this case also, and the Fenalco survey also registers this performance.Last of all, the total demand for energy surged 8.1% annually in April and the demand for non-regulated energy for industry climbed 8.2% annually.",
        "Given that the correlation between energy use and industrial production is high, a recovery in this area is expected to be seen in April.We can expect Colombian economic expansion to increase over the course of the year to the degree that aggregate expenditures react to the previous monetary policy measures and to the programs announced by the national government last month.",
        "The Bank’s technical team holds to their forecast of 3.0% to 5.0% growth in the GDP for 2013 with 4.3% being the most probable rate    Financial VariablesIn April, the growth of bank loans (N/ and F/C) continued to decline as it registered an annual growth rate of 14.0% which is 18 bp lower than that for the month before.",
        "This slowdown can be explained by the performance of the portfolio in national currency, which went from growing at an annual rate of 13.2% in March to 12.6% in April.",
        "During the same period, the portfolio in foreign currency saw an upswing in its annual change as it went from 29.4% to 36.3%.Going by types, the slowdown was concentrated in loans allocated to households with a reduction in the growth rates for consumer credit (from 15.6% to 14.6% between March and April) and for the mortgage portfolio (from 14.1% to 13.7% between March and April).",
        "The commercial loan portfolio, in turn, presented a slight recovery in its annual growth during April (13.5% compared to 13.2% in March).",
        "This was mainly due to the strength of the portfolio in foreign currency.The real interest rate in April for disbursements allocated to consumer loans was 15.5%.",
        "For mortgages, it was 9.5%; for preferential loans, it was 4.6%; and for regular commercial loans, 8.4%, all of which rates are below their respective historical averages calculated since 2000.",
        "However, the real interest rates for credit card loans and for the treasury loans were at 26.4% and 5.1% respectively.",
        "These rates are above their averages calculated since 2000.The nominal interest rates for all of the different types of loans granted marked a declining trend in comparison to their levels during the last part of July 2012 when the policy interest rate began to go down.",
        "Up until April, the strongest reaction was seen in the rates for preferential loans (-237 bp), housing construction (-178 bp), consumer loans (-160 bp), and micro-credit (-160 bp).",
        "In the case of others, –the interest rates for regular loans (-151 bp), mortgages (-117 bp), and credit cards (-107 bp) – they declined to a lesser degree.",
        "This reduction has also been transmitted to the real interest rates in spite of the recent drop in inflation.",
        "During the above mentioned period, the declines of 177 bp in preferential loans, 118 bp in construction loans, 96 bp in consumer loans, 91 bp in regular commercial loans, and 87 bp in micro-credit stand out    The External ContextRecent data suggest that growth in the industrialized economies will be similar to what was expected in the latest Inflation Report.",
        "The United States is growing at a moderate rate, Europe continues to contract, and Japan seems to be starting to react to the vigorous monetary stimulus measures.",
        "However, several of the emerging country economies in Asia and Latin America have slowed down more than expected.In the euro zone, the contraction of the GDP was less than what had been registered in the last quarter of 2012.",
        "In spite of that, the deterioration of the economies on the periphery continued to affect Germany and, to a greater degree, France.",
        "The latest figures on productive activity show that the economy in the region has continued to shrink.",
        "Nevertheless, in the case of Germany, the information is more favorable and could be indicating a bit of a recovery in the next few months.",
        "Thus, the region’s rate of deterioration may be slowing down.In the United States, some private expenditure indicators for the second quarter suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a slow rate.",
        "The information on consumption, manufacturing, and services indicates that growth held steady in April.",
        "The housing market, likewise, continued to recover and the prices of other financial assets, to appreciate.In China, the economy has expanded at a lower rate than expected.",
        "As of April, the information on exports, industrial activity, and retail sales show an annual growth that is lower than it was in past years.",
        "Likewise, the growth of investment in fixed assets has continued to slow down.In the case of Latin America, productive activity slowed down in Mexico, Chile, and Peru in March.",
        "Part of this phenomenon could be associated with the effect of having fewer working days due to Easter week in the first quarter.",
        "Although the recovery of economic activity has continued in Brazil, its expansion was less than what had been expected by the economic authorities and analysts.Regarding the international prices for commodities, the price quotes for petroleum have declined in the last few weeks.",
        "The current average price of oil is 3.5% below the average for 2012.",
        "With respect to other raw materials such as copper, coal, and nickel, their prices are also below the levels for 2012.",
        "In addition, the international prices for food have not shown significant rises so far this year and none are expected for the next few months due to the fact that climate conditions have been normal in the producing areas.",
        "Furthermore, record harvests are expected in Brazil.Except for specific cases, consumer inflation is at low, stable levels in both the advanced and emerging economies.",
        "For the next few months, upward risks are not expected.In a context of weak economic growth and low inflation, the monetary stimulus measures implemented by the central banks of the main developed economies are expected to remain steady for the rest of the year.Finally, the lower prices for commodities in comparison to the average seen in 2012, a slowdown in economic growth in Latin America that was more serious than expected, and the conjectures about the possibility that the Federal Reserve of the United States may begin to reduce its asset purchase program along with other factors affected the risk premiums and the exchange rates in the region.To summarize, weaker global economic activity is still being projected for 2013 in comparison to what was seen in 2012.",
        "The slower growth in the emerging economies leads one to anticipate that the demand for Colombian exports could be slightly lower than was previously estimated.",
        "In this context, terms of trade that are lower than the average seen in 2012 continue to be predicted.",
        "If these trends continue, the stimulation of the Colombian economy from abroad in 2013 could be more limited than in previous years     AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects under consideration:(i) The recent data suggest that the industrialized economies’ growth will be similar to what was expected a month ago.",
        "The United States is growing at a slow rate, Europe continues to contract, and Japan seems to be starting to react to the strong monetary stimulus measures.",
        "However, several of the emerging country economies in Asia and Latin America have slowed down more than expected.",
        "(ii) The slower growth in the emerging economies leads one to anticipate a slightly lower demand for Colombian exports than was previously estimated and terms of trade that are lower than the average seen in 2012.",
        "(iii) The Colombian peso like the currency of several Latin American countries has depreciated with respect to the dollar.",
        "This could be associated with the reduction in the international prices for the commodities that these countries export, the slowdown in their economic growth, and the conjectures about the possibility that the Federal Reserve of the United States may begin to reduce its asset purchase program.",
        "The Banco de la Republica’s intervention in the local foreign exchange market as well as the measures adopted by the government have reinforced the tendency of the peso to depreciate.",
        "(iv) The indicators that are available so far suggest that growth in the second quarter will be higher than the growth in the first.",
        "In April, consumer confidence improved substantially as the indicators of business expectation in industry, commerce, and consumption of electricity.",
        "In addition, the reductions in the benchmark interest rate are still being transmitted to the nominal and real interest rates and total credit halted its slowdown.",
        "(v) In general, it is to be expected that Colombian economic expansion will rise over the course of the year to the degree in which aggregate expenditure reacts to the prior monetary policy measures and the programs announced by the national government last month.",
        "The Bank’s technical team holds to their forecast that the GDP will grow 3.0% to 5.0% in 2013 with 4.3% being the most probable rate.",
        "(vi) In April, annual inflation (2.02%) surged.",
        "The measurements of core inflation not show significant changes.",
        "Both the average of those measurements and the inflation expectations are at or below the target (3%).In summary, the growth of the Colombian economy was below 3% in the first quarter, but the monetary policy and fiscal actions that have been taken so far are expected to contribute to getting the output to go to its potential level over the course of the year.",
        "Furthermore, there is a high probability that inflation will culminate within the target range.",
        "In this context and with the evaluation of the risk balance, the Board of Directors decided it would be advisable to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%     DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the balance of risks, the Board of Directors agreed unanimously to keep the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on July 26, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation and the economic situation with respect to growth prospects for the future (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and the policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2)     WITH TO AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation was 2.16% in June; this is 16 basis points (bp) higher than the rate in May.",
        "The rise in total inflation in June was concentrated in the CPI for regulated items, inasmuch as price increases for the other sub-baskets were moderate.In June, the annual change in the CPI for regulated items was 1.98%, which represents a hike of 73 bp with respect to the month before.",
        "The largest increase was in electricity rates, primarily in Bogotá.",
        "It is important to point out that the prices in this sub-basket rose considerably during the last three months.",
        "However, the levels are still low compared to the other CPI components and the historic record for the series.The other two non-food CPI components – tradables and non-tradables – showed little change during the past month.",
        "In tradables (excluding food and regulated items), the annual variation rose to 1.1%; that is, four (4) bp more than the rate in May, as has been the case since April.",
        "This could be related to depreciation of the peso in recent months.",
        "On the other hand, the annual change in the non-tradable CPI (excluding food and regulated items) climbed to 3.78%, which is four (4) bp more than the figure in May, reflecting modest demand-pull inflationary pressure.",
        "Rentals, which are the main component of the non-tradable CPI, were near 3.7%, down slightly from the rate in May.",
        "This item has exhibited a slow decline since the fourth quarter of last year.As for the food CPI, the annual variation in June remained low (1.34%), as it has been so far this year.",
        "The annual change in the CPI for perishable foods declined slightly (2.4% in June following 2.6% in May), while that of the CPI for processed foods (-0.11% in June) remained stable compared to the month before.",
        "The annual change in the CPI for meals outside the home (3.5%) was up by 20 bp in June with respect to the month before.In June, the average of the four core inflation indicators monitored by Banco de la República rose slightly to 2.52%.",
        "This is eight (8) bp above the average in April.",
        "The four indicators have been between 2% and 3% since January of this year.The annual variation in the PPI in June remained negative (-0.2%), but was up compared to the month before (-2.1%).",
        "This trend is due, in part, to the pass-through of nominal depreciation to the annual change in the imported PPI, which is on positive ground (0.6%) for the first time in several months.",
        "The local component increased as well.Inflation expectations rose slightly in June, but remained at levels in harmony with meeting the inflation target.",
        "The measurements based on Banco de la República’s monthly survey of financial market analysts are near 2.6% for December of this year (seven (7) bp more than a month ago) and 3.1% for June 2014 (up eight (8) bp compared to June).",
        "On the other hand, inflation expectations derived from the TES yield curve exhibited less change and stayed within a range of 2.3% to 3.1% for different horizons    GrowthThe economic indicators for the second quarter suggest GDP growth will exceed the rate on record for the first three months of the year.",
        "An important part of this build-up is attributed to the fact that April has more working days and some of the supply shocks witnessed between February and March this year have been overcome.As for the different components of spending, consumption and exports are expected to be the most dynamic, while there could be a slowdown in investment.Household consumption would have performed better than during the first quarter, as evidenced by consumer confidence and retail sales.",
        "In the first case, the consumer confidence index (CCI) rose significantly in June, reaching levels similar to those on record in late 2011 and surpassing the average for 2012 and the historical level as of 2001.",
        "On the other hand, according to the latest results of the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (, the acronym in Spanish) published by DANE, retail sales rose 6.5% in May, in annual terms, compared to the same period in 2012.",
        "When sales of automobiles and motorcycles (which were up by 5.3%) are discounted, the resulting aggregate rose 6.8%, following 3.4% in April.Gross capital formation is expected to be less dynamic in the second quarter.",
        "As for investment, apart from building construction and works, performance is expected to be weak.",
        "This is evident from the figures on imports of capital goods (especially transportation equipment), which posted declines.",
        "Moreover, Banco de la República’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE, the acronym in Spanish) found no recovery in the intention of entrepreneurs to invest in fixed capital.",
        "As for investment in building construction and works, lower growth rates are anticipated compared to those observed during the first quarter.There was some recovery in the amount of total exports in dollars during April and May, but annual growth in this respect remains negative (-2.5% in May).",
        "The recovery was due to increased exportable quantities of certain commodities (mainly oil and derivatives thereof, ferronickel and coffee).",
        "Exports of industrial goods and “others” are a case in point, with 6.7%, annual growth, thanks largely to added exports of vehicles (256%), meat (202%) and chemicals (5.4%).",
        "Exports are expected to grow at higher rates during the remainder of 2013, now that some of the supply shocks witnessed this year between January and March have been overcome.In May, CIF imports in dollars were down 6.6% with respect to the same month in 2012.",
        "This performance is explained by a drop of 12.8% in imports of capital goods and 5.7% in intermediate goods.",
        "On the other hand, imports of consumer goods rose 2.7%.",
        "The trend component of the series for total imports shows gradual increases as of the last few months, but with very low annual growth rates.With respect to the various branches of the economy, industry is expected to continue to contract, although less so, while mining, construction, agriculture and commerce are expected to perform well.The indicators at hand point to a setback in industrial GDP during the second quarter, in annual terms.",
        "The industrial production index, without coffee threshing, declined 3.1% in May; in terms of levels, one sees a standstill and the trend component ceased to contract.",
        "Other indicators for the sector, such as business orders and expectations at three months, based on the survey, speak of weak performance in the sector, as does industrial energy demand.",
        "However, the industrial confidence index recovered slightly and its trend component shows an increase for the first time in a year.With respect to mining, added growth is expected for the second quarter due to the rise observed in coal and oil production, although the latter experienced a drop in June due to supply shocks.",
        "Oil production adds up to more than one million barrels so far this year to June,  and coal exports performed remarkably in April-May, following the problems Cerrejon and Drummond faced in February and March.In the construction sector, the indicators at hand suggest the good performance witnessed in the first quarter would have continued during the three months thereafter.",
        "Specifically, annual cement production was up by 1.0% in May and 2.6%, on average, between April and May, following an average annual decline of 6.4% between January and March.",
        "Building permits rose 28.9% in April-May, maintaining the strong recovery exhibited during the first three months of the year (31.9%).As for the agricultural sector, the recovery in coffee production, which increased by about 40% annually in the second quarter according to the Federation of Coffee Growers, coupled with the increase in cattle slaughtered during April and May (approximately 5%), give hope of a turnaround in the low growth rates posted by this sector during the second half of 2012.Given all of these elements, the Colombian economy is expected to grow by around 3.4% in the second quarter of 2013.",
        "This is the most likely figure within a range of 2.5% to 4.0%, the extent of which is determined by uncertainty as to how investment in works and public consumption will perform.The forecast for growth during 2013, as a whole, was revised downward somewhat, compared to the figure published in the last Inflation Report.",
        "The new forecast range is between 3.0% and 4.5%, with 4.0% being the most likely figure.",
        "This revision is explained, in part, by the actual behavior of the world economy and private spending, which have been weaker than expected    Financial VariablesIn June, bank lending (/ and F/C) posted an annual increase of 14.06%, which is similar to the growth observed in recent months.",
        "The annual build-up in the loan portfolio in domestic currency went from 12.67% to 12.86% between May and June, while the increase in loans in foreign currency during that same period went from 34.53% to 33.23%.As for the different types of lending, the annual variation in consumer loans was 13.66% by June, as opposed to 14.40% in May.",
        "On the contrary, annual growth in the mortgage portfolio was up from 13.73% in May to 13.95% in June.",
        "The recovery in the commercial loan portfolio that began in March continues to gain strength, having registered a monthly increase of 46 bp in the annual growth rate at June (13.96%).Interest rates on loans from credit institutions continued to decline for all types of lending, with the exception of credit card and micro-credit rates.",
        "Accordingly, by June 2013, the reductions accumulated since the benchmark rate cuts began in July 2012 came to -251 bp for the preferred lending rate, -228 bp for the mortgage rate and -203 bp for the ordinary commercial rate.",
        "Other lesser variations include -187 bp for the rate on home construction loans, -179 bp for consumer loans, -156 bp for micro-credit,  -144 bp for treasury loans and  -101 bp for credit card lending.The extent of the decline in real interest rates has been less, due to the effect of lower inflation.",
        "In real terms, the reduction since July 2012 came to -219 bp for the preferred rate, -195 bp for the interest rate on mortgage loans, -183 bp for ordinary commercial loans, -155 bp for construction loans, -146 bp for consumer loans, and -119 bp for microcredit.By June, the real interest rates on consumer loans (15.0%), mortgages (8.1%), preferred loans (4.2%), ordinary commercial lending (7.5%) and treasury loans (4.5%) were below their historic averages calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the real interest rate on credit card lending (26.1%) was above average    The External ContextThe world economy continued to expand slowly during the first half of 2013.",
        "Industrial performance and world trade are still being affected by weak global demand.Although the economic indicators for the Euro Zone continued to decline, they exhibited less deterioration than in previous quarters.",
        "These results are explained, in part, by the added growth of the German economy.In the United States, retail sales, industry and services showed signs of moderate growth.",
        "The slowdown in some indicators reflected the increased impact of the fiscal adjustment.Japan saw a recovery in its exports, aided by a weaker yen and a broad rebound in consumer spending, investment by large corporations, and household and business expectations.Once again, the emerging countries were the driving force of the world economy.",
        "However, their growth would not have matched what was anticipated in the March edition of the Inflation Report.",
        "Less momentum in the external sector, coupled with a slowdown in domestic demand, appear to be the reasons why their growth rates have dropped-off.China has experienced more of a slowdown in production than was anticipated, likely because of less growth in the external sector and in certain components of domestic demand.",
        "Annual growth during the second quarter (7.5%) was less than in the first three months of the year (7.7%).In Latin America, the indicators of productive activity show second-quarter growth continued to abate compared to the increase observed in 2011-2012.",
        "The performance of exports and industrial activity in the region is not encouraging.Weak global demand, coupled with a number of favorable supply conditions, kept international prices for the major commodities at levels below those observed during 2012.",
        "This being the case, and despite the growing geopolitical tensions that led to a recent hike in oil prices, the Brent reference  price is still less than the average for 2012 and slightly above the central forecast announced in the March edition of the Inflation Report.The prices of other commodities exported by Colombia continued to decline in recent months and are below the estimate in the last Inflation Report.",
        "This situation would be due to the recent decline in the country’s terms of trade, which has been offset, in part, by lower international prices for certain imported goods, such as food.",
        "Currently, food prices are lower than in 2012, although they have increased slightly in recent weeks.Inflation in the major developed economies remains low, facilitating an expansive monetary stance.",
        "In the case of emerging countries, the situation is similar, but with some exceptions such as Brazil, India and Indonesia, where the central banks have recognized the need to increase their benchmark rates, given the rapid rise in their price levels.In international financial markets, the interest rates that rose in recent months, following the Fed’s announcement of a possible withdrawal of its stimulus program, saw partial declines in the last few weeks.",
        "The situation with respect to the volatility indicators, risk indicators and exchange rates was similar.In short, the outlook for this year signals growth for the country’s trading partners and lower terms of trade than in 2012.",
        "Global demand is expected to improve as of the second half of this year and during 2014, albeit at a slower pace than was estimated in the last Inflation Report.",
        "The cost of foreign financing should remain low, but could increase gradually if the Fed actually begins to tapper its asset purchases AND OPTIONSThe relevant aspects taken into account by the Board of Directors are summarized below.",
        "(i)     Global economic growth remains modest, with considerable differences between countries.",
        "While the contraction in Europe persists, a rapid recovery in productive activity is ongoing in Japan.",
        "In the United States, the build-up in private demand is being offset, in part, by fiscal consolidation, leading to a slight decline in the forecast for growth.",
        "Expansion in a good portion of the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America is still robust, but less than anticipated.",
        "Consequently, the expectation this year is for growth of the country’s trading partners and lower terms of trade than in 2012.",
        "(ii)   A stronger dollar and the rise in long-term foreign interest rates during May and June partly reversed in July.",
        "The same occurred with risk premiums and the interest rates on government paper in the region.",
        "(iii)  The rise in oil, ferronickel and coffee production and the increased rate of growth in foreign industrial sales in dollars during the second quarter of 2013 suggest better export performance.",
        "The rise in consumer confidence and the added growth in retail trade also indicate some degree of acceleration in private consumption.",
        "On the supply side, the build-up in the economy comes mainly from mining, agriculture and commerce.",
        "Industry would contract once again, although less so.",
        "Accordingly, the Bank’s technical staff estimates second-quarter growth will be somewhere between 2.5% and 4.0%, with 3.4% being the most likely figure.",
        "(iv) The Bank’s technical staff lowered its forecast on the most probable growth rate for 2013 from 4.3% to 4%, within a range of 3.0% to 4.5%.",
        "This revision is due, in part, to the performance of the world economy and private spending, which have been weaker than anticipated.",
        "Economic growth in Colombia is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the programs being carried out by the national government.",
        "(v)The rise in bank loans in domestic and foreign currency is showing signs of stabilizing at a higher rate than the growth in nominal GDP.",
        "Interest rates on loans continue to decline and, in real terms, are below their historic averages (except in the case of credit card lending).",
        "(vi) Annual inflation in June (2.16%) and average core inflation (2.5%) were slightly higher than in May.",
        "Analysts’ average inflation expectations and those calculated based on government bond rates are similar to the inflation target, which is 3%.In short, the economic indicators and economic projections show less output than can be generated with the country’s installed capacity.",
        "It is hoped the monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted so far will help to increase the output rate this year.",
        "Inflation is low and expectations are anchored to the long-term target (3%)     DECISIONPursuant to its assessment of the current risk balance, the Board of Directors unanimously agreed to hold the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to carefully monitor performance and projections concerning economic activity and inflation in Colombia, asset markets and the international situation.",
        "Finally, it reiterated that monetary policy will depend on new information as it becomes available.Bogotá,",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on September 27, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2)     AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation in August was 2.27%, which is 5 basis points (bp) above what was registered the month before.",
        "In the first eight months, the accumulated change in the CPI came to 1.86%, which is less than the aggregate variation for the same length of time in 2012 (2.03%).The annual change in the CPI for food in August was 1.8%, 13 bp higher with respect to July.",
        "The upswing was concentrated in the basket of perishables (5.5% in comparison to 4.0% in July).",
        "This may be due to the decline in the supply of these products because of the blockades experienced that month.",
        "The change in the prices for eating away from home saw a slight rise as they went from 3.5% in July to 3.6% in August.",
        "The annual change in the prices for processed foods (-0.1%) dipped in comparison to July (0.1%).In the CPI excluding food, the annual variation in August (2.45%) not change with respect to what had been seen the previous month.",
        "The rises in the annual changes in the prices for tradables and regulated items were registered in this basket.",
        "In the case of the first one, the uptick (from 1.3% to 1.4% in August) is added to the ones seen during previous months and is partly related to the depreciation of the peso that has been registered over the course of the year.",
        "With respect to the regulated items, the annual change (1.5%) meant an increase of 9 bp compared to the month before.",
        "This upswing was concentrated in public transportation fees which went from growing 1.7% annually in July to 2.5% in August (the rise was partly the result of the effect of the statistical basis of comparison on the annual variation which captured the drop in Transmilenio fees ordered in August 2012).",
        "The other two components of regulated items –utilities and fuel– fell.A decline of 12 bp in the annual change in the basket of non-tradables excluding food and regulated items (3.8%) occurred during the month.",
        "This level is similar to the one in June.",
        "In July, there had been an upswing of 12 bp.",
        "This volatility is essentially due to the segment of entertainment, cultural and leisure activities (specifically soccer tickets).",
        "The annual rental adjustment (3.7%), in turn, remained stable.The average for the four core inflation indicators that are monitored by the Banco de la República was at 2.54% in August, a figure that is the same as the one for the month before.",
        "This indicator has been extremely stable at around 2.5% since February of this year.The annual variation of the PPI stayed in negative territory in August (-0.5%).",
        "Both the local and imported components dropped in comparison to last month (52 bp in the former and 33 bp for the latter).Inflation expectations not register significant changes last month.",
        "According to the Bank’s monthly survey of financial market analysts, expected inflation for December of this year remained at 2.6% while the inflation expectations for the coming 12 months were at 3.0%, 7 bp lower than the previous month.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations derived from the yield curve of the TES at horizons of 2, 3, and 5 years have remained between 2.3% and 2.8%.",
        "These levels are slightly lower than the ones seen the month before    GrowthIn the second quarter of 2013, the Colombian economy grew 4.2% in comparison to the same period in 2012.",
        "This record was higher than the one for the first three months of the year (2.7%).",
        "Although part of this surge was expected, the result was higher than the range anticipated by the technical team (2.5% to 4.0%).Broken down by expenditure components, private consumption (4.4% annually), public consumption (5.0% annually) and net exports gave rise to the higher rate of growth.",
        "The contribution of the latter to the growth of the GDP was positive, something that has not occurred since the fourth quarter of 2009.",
        "This was due to the significant upswing seen in exports, which went from falling 2.7% annually in the first three months of the year to growing 7.6%.",
        "Meanwhile, imports grew at a slower pace (from -0.2% to 1.3% respectively).Broken down by branches of activity, all of the economic sectors with the exception of construction showed a better annual growth rate in the second quarter than in the previous one.",
        "The sectors that grew the most were agriculture (7.6%) and construction (6.4%).",
        "The performance of the mining sector was favorable (4.3%) but remained below the average for the last five years (10.3%).",
        "Industry, which includes coffee threshing, registered positive growth (1.2%) after having contracted for the last three quarters.For the third quarter, some of the indicators from July suggest that economic activity is still recovering.Private consumption may continue registering rates of growth similar to those seen in the first half of the year.",
        "According to the DANE Monthly Retail-trade Survey ( in Spanish), the retail sales for commercial establishments grew 5.4% in annual terms during July (compared to 5.2% registered in the second quarter of the year).",
        "When the effect of the sales of vehicles (cars and motorcycles) is discounted, sales grew 3.2% in the same period and their growth trend is continuing.",
        "Another indicator that points to the favorable performance of private consumption is the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish).",
        "This showed that in July, the conditions and sales expectations of businessmen were favorable since the outcome was above the second quarter average.",
        "The variables in the labor market also give a perspective of a better performance for private consumption in the third quarter.",
        "Wage-earning employment, which has shown a high correlation with private consumption, is growing at a positive rate (5.8% annually).",
        "Last of all, consumer credit has maintained a respectable rate of expansion (12.9% annually in August) and also points to a positive performance on the part of this expenditure in the third quarter.With respect to investment and with the information from July, stability in the outcome of the short and medium term investment expectations in the EMEE could indicate that those investments other than the ones intended for building construction and public works projects may be stabilizing in the third quarter.",
        "Furthermore, investment in buildings and public works projects are expected to grow at a favorable rate in the second half of the year.",
        "This is partly due to the statistical effect of a low base of comparison in 2012.There was also an annual decline of 6.6% in the value of the total exports in dollars during the month of July.",
        "The drop was due, in large part, to the -7.4% change in the exports of mining products (mainly coal and gold).",
        "Likewise, the foreign sales of agricultural products registered an annual fall of 8.8%.",
        "In the case of exports of industrial and other goods, there was a 3.2% reduction in July.In July, total imports in dollars declined 1.6% annually.",
        "These reduced purchases from abroad are because of the 11.5% drop in purchases of capital goods since the purchases of consumer goods and raw materials grew 4.2% and 3.9% respectively.",
        "The decline in imports of capital goods is associated to a large degree with those of transportation equipment (-35.1%).",
        "The drop in this item is primarily due to the -50.5% change in rolling stock.With respect to supply, the few indicators available for the third quarter of 2013 suggest improvements in commerce, construction, and industry.",
        "In the case of commerce, in addition to the abovementioned strength of retail sales in July, the better outlook for the present and future that the Fedesarrollo survey arrived at should be noted.",
        "In the case of construction, although there was an 11.4% drop in licences in July, the aggregate figure for twelve months continues to show growth (around 6.2%).",
        "Production and sales of cement, in turn, grew 6.2% and 11.5% respectively in July.In the case of industry, the annual growth of production was slightly positive (0.2%) in July.",
        "It is noteworthy that for the first time this year, the trend component of the series is on a rising slope.",
        "Growth for the year up to July is still in negative territory (it went from -3.4% in June to -2.9% in July).",
        "Other variables related to the sector, such as indicators of orders, inventory, production expectations at three months and industrial confidence expectations published by Fedesarrollo based on information as of July, confirm the change in the trend and show an improvement with respect to previous months.That is how the latest information increased the probability that the GDP would grow this year at a rate similar to the rate in 2012.",
        "The economic activity indicators and their projections show that the output level is moving towards its potential.",
        "The monetary and fiscal policy actions taken so far are expected to contribute to strengthening this trend    Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) in August registered an annual growth rate of 13.9%, which is slightly higher than what was seen the month before (13.8%).",
        "The annual growth of the portfolio in national currency went from 12.45% to 12.91% between July and August while the foreign currency portfolio dropped from 37.07% to 30.66% during the same period.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households saw an annual growth rate of 13.21% which is 6 bp lower than the previous month.",
        "This was due to the stability in consumer loans (12.90% in both July and August) and the slight dip in the portfolio for housing purchases which went from 14.28% in July to 14.06% in August.",
        "With respect to the portfolio of loans granted to companies, the annual growth rate increased 26 bp between July and August (14.05%).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -224 bp for mortgages, -210 bp for consumer loans, and -194 bp for building loans.The levels of the real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit in August were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the real rates for credit card loans are above their average.The size of the decline in the real interest rates since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark interest rate has been lower due to the lower rate of inflation.",
        "There have been reductions during the same period of: -190 bp in mortgages, -174 bp in consumer loans, and -160 bp in loans for construction    The External EnvironmentThe world economy has continued to recover mainly due to the developed countries.",
        "In the euro zone, the figures for economic activity have been better than expected while growth has remained modest in the U  As was forecast, the large emerging economies are registering a weaker rate of economic activity compared to 2012 and, in some of them, the economy has slowed down more than expected.In the euro zone, the recent indicators of productive activity and confidence show that the economic recovery that took place in the first part of the year is still in progress.",
        "In spite of this, the expansion rate across the region remains very low (-0.7% annually in the second quarter of 2013) and the weakness persists since the labor markets are still vulnerable and credit has not shown signs of recovery yet.In the United States, the economic expansion continues at a modest rate.",
        "During the second quarter, the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.6% which showed a slight uptick compared to what was registered in the first quarter (1.3%).",
        "The recent figures on retail sales and industrial activity showed a positive trend.",
        "In addition, although the unemployment rate is still on a downward trend, the creation of jobs remains low.",
        "The recent increases in the long term interest rates have been transmitted to the interest rates of mortgage loans.",
        "This phenomenon has occurred simultaneously with a slight slowdown in some figures for the housing market (construction start ups and permits, housing prices).",
        "These facts have generated warnings about the sensitivity of the housing market recovery to a lower expansion of the monetary policy in that country.With respect to the emerging economies, the growth in the first half of the year was lower than what was registered last year.",
        "However, this growth is still favorable.",
        "In China, the industrial output, retail sales, and some international trade indicators rebounded again in August which would indicate that productive activity could become stronger in the third quarter.The results of the first half of the year were mixed for the countries in Latin America.",
        "Productive activity slowed down sharply in Mexico as it went from an annual expansion rate of 2.6% in the first quarter to 0.3% in the second quarter.",
        "Chile also saw a lower rate of expansion in the second quarter (4.0% annually) compared to the results for the first quarter (5.1% annually).",
        "In contrast, economic activity rebounded in Brazil during the second quarter with an annual growth rate of 3.3% in comparison to the 1.9% registered in the first quarter.",
        "In Peru, better annual growth in the second quarter was also registered (5.6% vs5% in the first).",
        "For the third quarter, the latest information shows that economic activity in Mexico could grow at a moderate pace while in Chile and Peru, the economy should continue expanding at a favorable rate.Regarding the international prices for commodities, the geopolitical tensions in the Mid-East raised the foreign price quotes for petroleum again.",
        "Recent announcements helped to partially reduce these surges.",
        "In this context, the prices of crude oil will be at the upper limit of the forecast range established in the last Inflation Report (110USD/barrel).The foreign prices of other goods exported by Colombia such as coal and nickel have shown some stability in the last few weeks.",
        "Coffee prices declined again.",
        "In the case of some imported food such as wheat and corn, the favorable supply conditions have lowered international prices.",
        "As a result, the country’s terms of trade stopped falling and stayed at historically elevated levels.Inflation in the main developed countries is remaining at relatively stable levels.",
        "However, the price trend in Japan, a country in which the expansionary economic policies are causing a rise in price levels, deserves mention.",
        "For emerging economies the situation is less homogenous inasmuch as countries such as Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to experience high inflation while economies such as Chile, Colombia, and Peru have seen a moderate rise in their inflation although the level is still low.It should be noted that the economies with strong inflationary and exchange rate pressures such as India and Indonesia raised their benchmark interest rates in the last few weeks.",
        "Other countries with fewer changes in prices and concerns about productive activity lowered them (Mexico and Hungary).With respect to global financial markets, the Fed’s decision to not start phasing out the monetary stimulus yet contributed to the appreciation of public and private bonds and to that of the currencies of the majority of the emerging countries.",
        "In spite of that, this correction has been partial and the prices of these assets are still higher than those seen before May.",
        "Moreover, it is likely that the uncertainty about when, how, and how soon the monetary stimulus program will be discontinued will continue to put pressure on the capital markets for the coming weeks.Note that the budget for the next fiscal year and the government’s debt limit are supposed to be negotiated in the US Congress in the next few days.",
        "In the last few years, these discussions between Democrats and Republicans have been very complex and polarized.",
        "This has generated a high level of uncertainty that has affected the confidence of American consumers and businessmen and has produced an increase in the volatility of the international financial markets AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors considered the following relative aspects.",
        "(i) The figures for the third quarter indicate that the growth of a significant number of advanced economies has improved at the same time as the emerging economies are growing slower than the year before.",
        "The average growth of Colombia’s trading partners will probably be lower in 2013 than in 2012.",
        "(ii) The international price of petroleum remains at high levels and the prices for some of the commodities that Colombia imports have fallen.",
        "As a result, the country’s terms of trade are staying at high levels.",
        "(iii) The US Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the monthly purchase asset program unaltered contributed to the appreciation of international financial assets and the appreciation of the majority of the emerging countries’ currencies.",
        "(iv) The growth of Colombia’s GDP in the second quarter was higher than what had been projected.",
        "With respect to domestic demand, both investment and consumption on the part of households and the government showed greater strength.",
        "Likewise, the real growth of exports surpassed that of imports.",
        "This is something that has not been seen since the second quarter of 2009.",
        "In the area of supply, all of the economic sectors with the exception of construction expanded at a faster pace than in the previous quarter with the agricultural sector showing the best performance.",
        "Industry, including coffee bean threshing, grew at a positive rate after having contracted for three consecutive quarters.",
        "(v) The indicators for the third quarter suggest that the GDP will grow at annual rates that are higher than those seen in the first half of the year.",
        "Investment, especially investment in buildings, should grow at high rates while consumption will probably grow at about the same rate as it in the first half of the year.",
        "That is what the retail figures, the monthly surveys of economic expectations for commerce, consumer credit, and wage-earning employment data suggest.",
        "(vi) Bank loans are growing at stable rates that are higher than those of the nominal GDP.",
        "In real terms, the interest rates for the different types of loans are below their historical averages (except for credit cards).",
        "The general financial conditions, however, may have adjusted to the rising price of foreign financing.",
        "(vii) The new information increased the likelihood that, this year, the GDP will grow at a rate that is similar to the rate in 2012.",
        "Nevertheless, although it is probable that the risks from advanced economies are now lower than before, those from some of the emerging economies may be rising.",
        "(viii) In August, annual inflation (2.27%) was in line with what had been estimated by the technical team and the core inflation average remained stable at 2.5%.",
        "The average of the analysts’ inflation expectations and those calculated on the basis of the rates for public debt securities is similar to the inflation target of 3%.The members of the Board highlighted the growth of output in the second quarter of the year, which was higher than the estimate, as a reflection of the greater strength of domestic demand and, for the first time since 2009, positive data for net exports.",
        "Likewise, the data on the labor market and the growth of wage-earning employment (5.8%) was favorable.",
        "Furthermore, although the consumer confidence index (CCI) published by Fedesarrollo in the month of August showed a drop, this is expected to be temporary.",
        "Economic growth is also expected to continue becoming stronger partly driven by the investment in construction of buildings and public works.",
        "Nevertheless, there are still elements of uncertainty in the foreign context in both the advanced and some emerging economies     DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the balance of risks, the Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on January 28, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the full-time co-directors Messrs. Fernando Tenjo Galarza, Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Juan José Echavarría Soto, Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo and César Vallejo Mejía.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached    BACKGROUNDa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation dropped sharply in December, far more than anticipated by the market and the technical team.",
        "The outcome by that month was 2.43%, which is 34 basis points (bp) less than the rate in November, a month that also witnessed a major decline.",
        "As a result, consumer inflation was below the target for 2012 and the long-term target (3%), but within the range of 2% to 4%.",
        "As occurred throughout the year, the slowdown in inflation can be explained, once again, by less of an increase in the CPI for food and regulated items.The annual variation in the food CPI at December (2.52%) showed a considerable drop (49 bp), adding to the one of the previous month and those of other months throughout the year.",
        "The decline in prices for a good many unprocessed foods accentuated in December; however, quite moderate and even negative changes in the prices of various processed and semi-processed foods continued to be observed as well.",
        "In the case of unprocessed foods, the drop in prices can be attributed to acceptable supply conditions and lower input costs.",
        "As for processed foods, the downward trend in prices is explained by the drop in international prices for corn and other cereals, oilseeds, oils and coffee, among others, as well as peso appreciation, and an important supply of imports.",
        "The annual variation in eating was down again, although slightly, reaching 4.9%Within the non-food CPI, the regulated sub-basket posted an annual variation of 1.9% (88 bp less than in November).",
        "This is the lowest rate on record since the end of 2008.",
        "The annual change in this item had declined as of the fourth quarter of 2010, but accentuated in the past two months.",
        "December saw reductions in the annual variations for all items.",
        "However, the sharpest was in public utilities and was led by the CPI for electrical power, which showed negative annual and monthly changes.",
        "In this case, the reduced risk posed by El Niño weather, coupled with the drop in producer inflation, which is part of the regulatory formulas, contributed to this behavior.",
        "Less of a change in the CPI for fuel also was important (only 1.3% at year’s end) and is associated with the gasoline price cuts.The annual difference in the other two components of the non-food CPI; that is, tradables and non-tradables, also showed reductions at December.",
        "In the first case, the annual change was 0.77%.",
        "This figure is 17 basis points less than the one in November.",
        "The annual adjustment in this basket had been around 1% since June 2012.",
        "This outcome may be associated partly with appreciation of the exchange rate.As for the non-tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items, the annual  variation at December was 3.92%, which is 5 bp less than the figure on record in November.",
        "This can be attributed to aggregate demand, which has experienced a slowdown since -year that could have contained more pronounced price adjustments.",
        "The change in rentals fees, which exhibited an upward trend over the past two years, declined slightly on this occasion (5 bp) and stood at 3.9%.The annual variation in core inflation also dropped sharply in December.",
        "The average of the four indicators monitored by Banco de la República came to 2.80%, which is 16 basis points less than the November figure.The annual change in the IPP remained in negative terrain and continued to decline, reaching -2.9% in December.",
        "There were sharp reductions in both the imported PPI and the PPI for goods produced and consumed in the country.",
        "In fact, the annual variations in both these baskets were in negative terrain (-4.8% and -2.6% respectively).",
        "Annual appreciation, the stability or decline in international prices, and a good agricultural supply explain this behavior.Inflation expectations continued to fall in December and early January.",
        "Banco de la República’s latest monthly survey indicates financial market analysts expect 2.9% inflation twelve months out (vs1% a month ago).",
        "In the case of the quarterly business survey, expected inflation twelve months out is 3.1% (it was previously 3.4%), while the estimates derived from TES show expected inflation near 2.6% for horizons at two, three and five years    GrowthThe information at hand for the fourth quarter suggests the annual increase in output would accelerate slightly during this period with respect to the previous quarter, but less so than during the first half of 2012.",
        "In the case of private consumption, the latest retail sales figures (with and without vehicles), the slowdown in annual growth in consumer lending (18.4% on average for the fourth quarter vs. 20.5% on average for the third), and stability in the consumer confidence indicator reported by Fedesarrollo indicate the rate of growth in this sector during the fourth quarter would be less than the one observed in the first three quarters.As for investment, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how this item will behave, especially spending on works, construction and buildings.",
        "In the other components of this expenditure, such as investment in transport equipment, the November increase in CIF imports of capital goods in the form of transport equipment (4.6% per year) would indicate a possible improvement with respect to what was observed during the third quarter of the year.",
        "Also noteworthy is the increase by November in imports of capital goods for agriculture (20.5% annually) and imports of construction materials (19%).With regard to exports, the totals in dollars fell by 7.7% in November compared to the same month in 2011 (-8.2% if re-exports of aircraft are considered).",
        "The performance in November is due to the combined drop in exports of mining and agricultural commodities (-11.9% and -18.9%, respectively).",
        "The most notable reductions in these groups concerned exports of petroleum and petroleum derivatives (-13.8%), coal (-12.4%) and coffee (-42%).",
        "The group comprised of industrial exports and others posted a positive annual variation of 12.7% in November 2012, with the rise in exports of vehicles (246%), chemicals (5.2%) and electrical machinery and equipment (43%) being the high points.On the supply side, the indicators at hand for the industrial sector show deterioration.",
        "The annual variation in the IPI excluding coffee threshing was -4.0% by November.",
        "The tendential component of the indicator shows a negative slope since May 2012.",
        "Moreover, according to Fedesarrollo, industrial confidence continued to deteriorate in November.",
        "There were no further reductions in the  indicator for orders, while the inventory indicator (counter-cyclical to production) saw a slight increase.",
        "However, this not affect the negative trends in both these indicators.",
        "Something similar happened with expectations for production three months out.",
        "Accordingly, the demand for unregulated industrial energy, which is highly correlated to the IPI, declined in December at an annual rate of 0.8%.",
        "However, it is important to note this effect could be due to fewer working days with respect to the same month last year.In contrast, in the case of trade, according to the Fedesarrollo survey for November, the economic situation of merchants has rebounded in recent months.",
        "Likewise, expectations six months out suggest improvements in the coming months.",
        "Something similar can be detected from the Fenalco survey for current sales.Several figures associated with mining, particularly oil, improved during the final quarter of 2012.",
        "The National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) reports oil production in December came to 984,000 barrels per day.",
        "On average, 972 MBD were produced in the fourth quarter, which is more than during the previous three months (934 MBD).",
        "This is due to the improvement in transport conditions and stabilization of production at the various fields, coupled with a reduction in the problems with law and order that affected production between the second and third quarters.All of the foregoing allows for a fourth-quarter annual GDP growth forecast between 2.0% to 3.5%.",
        "This contemplates a partial recovery in investment and performance in public and private consumption that would raise rates to near their historic averages.",
        "Exports and imports increased slightly less than the rates posted during the third quarter of 2012.",
        "On the supply side, the most dynamic sectors in the fourth quarter would have been transportation, social, community and personal services and, finally, mining.",
        "In contrast, construction and industry would be the sectors that detracted from growth.",
        "It is important to mention  that uncertainty about how investment in works will perform has increased significantly, but without a definite bias, given the high volatility the series has shown in recent quarters.",
        "This explains why the forecast range is broad.Consequently, the forecast range estimated for annual GDP growth in all of 2012 is between 3.3% and 3.9%.The technical team predicts between 2.5% and 4.5% economic growth for 2013.",
        "The major uncertainty with respect to this forecast is rooted in the possible persistence of the negative shock witnesses in investment in works and buildings.",
        "Some of the factors that have slowed this type of spending are expected to turn around, thereby bolstering domestic demand.",
        "The conditions that supported the momentum observed in consumption and investment in machinery and equipment are expected to continue during 2013.",
        "Among others, these include stable levels of employment and consumer confidence, and the accumulated reduction in policy interest rates.",
        "The latter is being passed through to interest rates on loans, coupled with lending that has slowed but continues to grow at a good pace.",
        "All of this is accompanied by an international context of broad liquidity and low interest rates    Financial VariablesIn December, the annual increase in bank lending (/ and F/C) came to 15.19%, which is 6 bp less than the rate in November.",
        "Compared to September and June, the decline came to 58 bp and 231 bp, respectively.As to the different types of lending, the commercial loan portfolio rebounded, with 13.8% annual growth in December, which is 46 bp higher than the rate observed the month before (13.3%).",
        "This momentum is explained by loans in foreign currency, which went from 5.8% growth to 14.5% between November and December, thereby consolidating the recovery that began in July.",
        "For its part, the component in domestic currency continued to slow, posting a decrease of 13.7% in December, down from 14.3% the month before.",
        "Annual growth in consumer lending came to 17.8% in December, which is 112 basis points less than the rate in November.",
        "Mortgage loans slowed somewhat, with an annual variation of 15.2% in December as opposed to 15.4% the month before.Nominal interest rates on all types of loans  mark a downward trend compared to their levels at the end of July, when the policy interest rate began to be reduced.",
        "However, the effect on real rates (discounting the non-food CPI) has been less, since inflation has declined as well.",
        "In this context, the real interest rate on December disbursements was 15.5% for consumer loans, 10.2%  for mortgages and  9.1% for regular commercial loans.",
        "These rates are below their historic averages calculated since 2000.",
        "On the other hand, the real interest rate on preferential commercial loans was 6.0% as opposed to 27.4% on credit card lending and 5.8% on treasury loans.",
        "These rates are higher than their averages calculated since 2000    The External ContextIn the Euro Zone, the measures adopted by economic policymakers in recent months brought calm to the financial markets, allowing for a reversal of the outflow of capital from peripheral countries of the region that had begun in the first half of 2012.",
        "Accordingly, the tensions on government bond markets for Spanish and Italian debt have very much subsided.",
        "Therefore, the probability of a major financial crisis that would deepen the recession in the Euro Zone has declined significantly.",
        "Nevertheless, this improvement in financial conditions has yet to pass through to the real sector.",
        "So, most analysts expect the recession in the region to continue during at least the first half of 2013.",
        "In fact, the latest figures for the Euro Zone show industrial production, retail sales and lending to the private sector contracted in November, while business and consumer confidence was still down.",
        "In December, the unemployment rate in several of the peripheral economies remained at record highs.",
        "Moreover, the region’s weak situation continued to affect countries such as Germany and France, economies that experienced a setback in industrial production during the final months of 2012.As for the United States, the indicators of real activity in the fourth quarter show the economy would have expanded at a moderate pace during that period.",
        "The figures at December show retail sales and industrial production continued to grow in both annual and monthly terms, while the housing market continues to recover, but still from a very low level.",
        "Performance in the external sector also remained depressed, evidencing the increased pass through of weak global demand.",
        "In addition, the levels of consumer confidence are still being affected by fiscal uncertainty.",
        "Regarding negotiations on the fiscal issue, the United States Congress reached a partial agreement to prevent the country from going over the so-called “fiscal cliff” for a few months.",
        "However, decisions on spending cuts in social security and defense, as well as the definition of certain federal budget items, were postponed until March.",
        "This being the case, fiscal uncertainty would continue to affect confidence in the early months of 2013.",
        "For the current year, the United States economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate, somewhat less than what was estimated for 2012.In China, economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to 7.9% annually (previously 7.4%).",
        "This would be fueling growth in other emerging countries of the region.",
        "Although the figures at December show an added increase in exports, industry and retail sales, the main force driving the economy has been investment in fixed assets.",
        "In 2013, China’s economy is expected to increase at a rate similar to the growth observed in 2012.With respect to the Latin American economies, the information at hand for the fourth quarter shows Chile and Peru would have grown at a rate close to their potential, while the Mexican economy has begun to slow, although its growth rate remains favorable.",
        "In Brazil, real activity has continued to recover in response to the stimulus measures implemented recently.",
        "The prospects for the coming year point to growth in Peru and Chile that is again favorable and near its potential, acceleration in Brazil, although at moderate rates, and a slowdown in Venezuela.In terms of oil prices, Brent crude benchmark prices behaved during the fourth quarter as anticipated in the September edition of the Inflation Report.",
        "On the other hand, although coal, nickel and coffee prices contracted in 2012, they increase slightly during the final months of the year.",
        "Food prices were on a downward trend in the final months of 2012, since the weather conditions that affected prices at midyear returned to normal.The slowdown in international food prices and the stability in crude oil prices helped to keep inflation low in the major developed economies.",
        "This fact, coupled with the weak momentum in these countries, made it possible to continue a monetary stimulus policy backed by low interest rates and ample injections of liquidity.",
        "For most of the Latin American economies, inflation adopted a downward trend during the final months of 2012.",
        "This would be explained by lower food prices and by generalized appreciation of the currencies of the region.In short, average economic growth in 2012 with respect to Colombia’s trading partners was consistent with expectations.",
        "As for 2013, the measures adopted by the European authorities and the improvement in financial conditions have reduced the likelihood of a sharp recession in the Euro Zone.",
        "In the United States, the latest information suggests its economy could grow at a somewhat slower pace than was estimated for 2012.",
        "China’s growth would  stay at around 8%.",
        "This being the case, the expectation for the current year is that external demand will remain weak and expand at a pace similar to the rate in 2012.",
        "Moreover, broad liquidity and low interest rates are expected to continue.The rising trend witnessed in terms of trade up to 2011 was interrupted in 2012, the year when terms of trade remained stable.",
        "Given the weakness of the global economy, terms of trade in 2013 could be somewhat less than the average observed in 2012     AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors considered the following factors in its deliberations:(i)  In the external context, average economic growth during 2012 with respect to Colombia’s trading partners was in line with expectations.",

        "In the United States, the latest information suggests its economy could grow at a somewhat slower pace than was forecast for 2012.",
        "China’s growth remains at around 8%.",
        "This being the case, the expectation for the current year is that external demand will continue to be weak and increase at a pace similar to the rate in 2012.",
        "(ii) The rising trend witnessed in terms of trade up to 2011 was interrupted in 2012, the year when terms of trade remained stable.",
        "Given the weakness of the global economy, terms of trade in 2013 could be somewhat below the average observed in 2012.",
        "(iii) As to the fourth quarter of 2012, the new figures on consumer lending, retail trade and consumer confidence suggest household spending would grow  slightly less than the rate observed in the third quarter.",
        "There is a great deal of uncertainty about how investment will behave, especially investment spent on works, construction and buildings.",
        "The figures for exports in dollars show more of a slowdown than for imports.",
        "(iv) On the supply side, the industrial production indicator posted an annual drop in November and expectations in the sector deteriorated yet again.",
        "Retail sales, both with and without vehicles, rose at a good pace.",
        "(v)  For 2013, the technical team forecasts between 2.5% and 4.5% economic growth, with 4% being the most likely figure.",
        "The major uncertainty with respect to this forecast is rooted in the possible persistence of the negative shock witnesses in investment in works and buildings.",
        "Some of the factors that have slowed this type of spending are expected to be reversed, thereby bolstering domestic demand.",

        "All of this is accompanied by an international context of broad liquidity and low interest rates.",
        "(vi) Annual consumer inflation in December (2.4%) declined more than anticipated by the market and by the Bank’s technical team.",
        "As occurred throughout the year, the slowdown in inflation was explained, yet again, by less of an increase in the CPI for regulated items and food.",
        "Average core inflation and inflation expectations declined again and are now below the long-term target (3%).",
        "(vii) In short, the Colombian economy is growing below its potential.",
        "Moreover, observed and projected inflation are under the 3% target, and there are no signs of upward pressure on inflation in the near future.",
        "Given these conditions, an assessment of the risk balance indicates the advisability of lowering the intervention interest rate to 4%.",
        "The monetary policy action that has been taken is designed to situate output in 2013 near the economy’s productive capacity, without jeopardizing the inflation target or the country’s macroeconomic stability.The majority of the Board members considered it appropriate to lower the intervention interest rate by 25 bp, primarily in view of the following:(i) Inflation forecasts and expectations are below the long-term target of 3%, as are total inflation and core inflation.",
        "(ii)  Weakening economic growth and the reduced growth forecasts for this year.",
        "(iii)  The significant and unexpected slowdown in domestic demand, mainly due to a negative shock to investment.",
        "The duration of this shock is uncertain and depends largely on the performance of public spending and investment in the mining sector during 2013.",
        "(iv) Private consumption grew at a rate close to its historic average, and it is feasible to expect it will slow somewhat this year, but not significantly.",
        "Given these conditions, the risk that a reduction of this size in the intervention interest rate would exacerbate the risk of financial imbalances and jeopardize growth in employment and output is considered limited.Moreover, the feeling is that although a more expansionary monetary policy is needed, uncertainty as to how domestic demand will evolve in the future and the possibilities of aggravating  previous imbalances accumulated by the economy, especially in an environment of ample international liquidity, suggest the advisability of  being prudent in terms of policy measures.One member of the majority group emphasized that, in addition to the problems affecting the construction sector in the third quarter of 2012, the weak growth in aggregate demand observed since the second quarter of 2012 has led to less growth in various sectors of the economy, so much so that there is now surplus  installed capacity.",
        "However, the abundance of international liquidity and the latest data on the supply of non-tradable goods and services indicate the momentum in domestic demand could increase by the end of 2013.Other members felt a 50 basis point reduction in the Bank’s intervention rate would be appropriate for a number of reasons.",
        "The information at hand confirms there is every indication at the beginning of 2013 that the recession in Europe would be more prolonged.",
        "The recovery in the United States has yet to be anything but mediocre.",
        "In the region, there is the good performance exhibited by Chile and Peru, and the fact that the downward trend in Brazil is being halted.",
        "Venezuela, the most important market for Colombian industrial exports, surely will experience serious devaluation this year due to its fiscal and exchange imbalances, and a drop in growth from 5.5% in 2012 to 2.5% in 2013.",
        "In Colombia, with an average real rate of exchange for 2012 at 8% below the equilibrium rate, the momentum in exports drops.",
        "In fact, between January and November, compared to the same period in 2011, exports rose by only by 6%, as opposed to 43% between 2010 and 2011.",
        "Mining and oil exports during the same interval went from an increase of 56% in 2011 to just 8% in 2012.",
        "Agricultural exports went from 26% to a drop of 14%, while the increase in industrial exports went from 15% to 7%.",
        "For industry, the problems associated with weakening domestic demand are bringing increasing weight to bear.",
        "Unemployment has ceased to decline, because total employment is growing less and less, to the point where the in 2013 will remain below that rate.",
        "Industrial employment began to drop for the first time in two years.",
        "It is in the domestic market where industry is losing ground to imports of consumer goods.",
        "This is consistent with the growth in trade,  in contrast to the contraction in industry.",
        "The technical team expects growth for this year to be within a range of 2.5% to 4.5%, with 4% being the most likely figure, but with a risk balance tilted towards the downside.",
        "This indicates the growth achieved in 2012 (about 3.6%) and the amount projected for 2013 are both below potential growth.",
        "In other words, the gaps in output and labor are in increasingly negative terrain.In short, weakening domestic demand, coupled with the continued fragility of the international context, has been evident since last year.",
        "Moreover, inflation in December was 56 basis points below the middle of the target range, while average core inflation was 2.8% and non-food inflation, 2.4%.",
        "All inflation expectations were below target as well.",
        "In keeping with an inflation targeting scheme, monetary policy should cause inflation to return to the 3% target.",
        "Consequently, they proposed lowering the Bank’s intervention interest rate by 50 basis points.",
        "From a monetary standpoint, this should be done to allow GDP to approach its potential yet again by the end of 2013 and in 2014, without jeopardizing compliance with the inflation target     DECISIONBased on its assessment of the current risk balance, the Board agreed to reduce the intervention interest rate by 25 bp.The Board reiterated that Banco de la República has sufficient tools and resources to satisfy the economy’s regular liquidity needs with respect to both local and foreign currency, as well as any needs that could arise in an environment of international financial turmoil.The Board will continue its careful monitoring of performance and projections with respect to economic activity and inflation in Colombia, asset markets and the international situation.",
        "Finally, it reiterated that monetary policy will depend on new information as it becomes available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on December 30, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2) AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationIn November, annual consumer inflation was 1.76%, which is 8 basis points (bp) lower than in October.",
        "So far this year, the datum comes to 1.67%, which is lower than the accumulated rise for the same period last year (2.34%).",
        "The decline in inflation in November is primarily due to the component of regulated items.The annual variation in the basket for food ended the month at 0.62%, 4 bp lower than the month before.",
        "The annual change in the prices for meals away from home and in the change for processed foods showed drops of 23 bp and 15 bp respectively.",
        "Within this second group, the prices of imported products or of other products that are produced in the country but are highly tradable have remained unchanged or have continued to fall.",
        "This reflects the lower international prices and the limited pressure from the exchange rate.",
        "The prices of perishables, in turn, fell 2.1%, which is a smaller drop than the one seen in October (-2.8%).The annual change in the CPI excluding food in November was at 2.21%, 10 bp lower than the month before.",
        "The fact that the annual change in the CPI for regulated items (0.5% annually) was a drop of 62 bp is noteworthy.",
        "This is again attributable to public utilities (fees for electricity service) and to the decline in the prices of fuel which was -3.95% annually last month.",
        "The accumulated depreciation of the peso over the course of the year and slight upticks in the prices of some imported goods have kept the annual change in the prices for tradable goods excluding food at 1.4%.",
        "The non-tradables excluding food, in turn, showed an annual change of 3.7%, which is 6 bp higher than the previous record.",
        "The annual variation in rent, the main component of the group, remained at 3.6%.The average of the four indicators of core inflation monitored by the Banco de la República was 2.46% in November, 2 bp higher than the previous month.",
        "This indicator has been stable at around 2.5% since February of this year.The PPI dropped 1.3% in November in comparison to the same month last year.",
        "This decline was less than the one in October (1.9%).",
        "The local component rose with respect to the month before (57 bp).",
        "The import component rose 1.2% annually, a figure that is higher than the one registered the previous month (0.95%).In November, inflation expectations continued to stay below the long term target although within the range established by the Board of Directors.",
        "The monthly survey of financial market analysts shows an expected inflation of 2.89% 12 months from now.",
        "This is 3 bp lower than the expectation a month earlier.",
        "For December of this year, the market expects a figure of 1.86%.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations derived from the TES for 2- and 3-year maturities remained relatively stable between 2.3% and 2.6%.",
        "Those with 5-year maturities rose a little and were at 2.8% GrowthAccording to the information published by DANE, the Colombian economy expanded 5.1% in annual terms during the third quarter of 2013.",
        "This figure, which indicated a significant surge with respect to what had been registered in the first half of the year, was in the upper part of the forecast range presented in the previous Inflation Report (between 3.8% and 5.2%).",
        "From the beginning of the year to September, the growth of the GDP (3.9% annually) was similar to the key projection made by the technical team at the Banco de la República.During the July - September quarter, domestic demand grew at a positive rate (6.0% annually).",
        "This was due to a very good performance on the part of building construction (26.7% annually), of public works (18.2% annually), a sharp expansion in public consumption (5.7% annually), and a growth in household consumption (4.0% annually) that was close to its historical average.",
        "With respect to the international trading accounts, exports slowed down in annual terms in comparison to the second quarter (1.9% vs8%) due to several supply shocks in mining production that substantially affected foreign sales.",
        "In the case of imports, higher annual growth rates were reported in comparison to the second quarter of 2013 (2.9% vs3%).On the supply side, the sectors that registered the highest annual growth in the third quarter were construction (21.3%), agriculture (6.6%), and mining and quarrying (6.1%).",
        "Industry continued to be the sector with the worse performance (-1.0%).",
        "Other sectors such as commerce and finance maintained a favorable rate of expansion as they grew at annual rates of 4.3% and 4.9% respectively.In the fourth quarter of 2013, household consumption could remain strong.",
        "This comes from the indicators such as retail sales published by DANE that show that it grew at an annual rate of 6.6% in October and at 4.5% excluding vehicle sales.",
        "Part of this growth is explained by the low base of comparison from last year.",
        "The Banco de la República’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) also reveals that based on data up to October, sales expectations are higher than the average registered for the third quarter of the year.",
        "Furthermore, the consumer confidence index (CCI) published by Fedesarrollo in November shows records similar to those seen in the month of October and slight improvements in the indicators of expectations.",
        "Likewise, the growth in imports of consumer goods (8.4% real) as well as the stability of the annual growth of the consumer loan portfolio (12.7%) indicates that consumption will maintain the strength seen in the last few quarters.With respect to investment, the Banco de la República’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) with data up to October suggests a positive performance of investment other than building construction and public works in the last quarter of the year.",
        "The information on imports of capital goods shows that, in October, purchases of these types of goods remained at elevated levels as they grew 5.3% in real pesos (according to the technical team’s estimates).For total exports in dollars, the annual change in October was -11%.",
        "This drop was due to the combined decline in foreign sales of mining (-14.4%), agricultural (-7.4%), and industrial products and others (-0.4%).",
        "Total imports, in turn, in dollars grew 2.7% compared to the same period last year.With respect to supply, the few indicators available show that sectors such as mining, commerce, and construction should continue to show high growth in the fourth quarter of the year.The Ministry of Mining and Energy reported that petroleum production in November came to a million twelve-thousand barrels per day (1.012 MBD) which indicates a growth of 2.63% in comparison to October and of 4.3% compared to the same month in 2012.",
        "In the case of commerce, in addition to the results from the DANE monthly manufacturing survey mentioned above, the survey as of November showed that the businessmen’s perception of the situation with current sales and expectations for sales in 6 months continued its rising trend.",
        "Based on October figures for construction, the production and delivery of cement saw an annual growth of 18.4% and 13.9% respectively.The figures published by DANE for industry in the month of October reported an annual growth that was negative but close to zero (-0.1%).",
        "Over the course of the year it fell 2.4%.",
        "Weakening of industry continues but at a slower pace in comparison to previous months (in August and September it fell 3.9% and 1.8% respectively).",
        "In November, industrial demand for energy grew 3.1% annually and the trend began to show a positive slope.",
        "This has a high correlation with industrial production as a result of which, its recent strength suggests that industry is recovering going into the fourth quarter.Likewise, the imports of raw materials in October suggest that productive activity will expand at the beginning of the fourth quarter at a good pace.",
        "For that month, the level of these imports remained high with a growth rate of 10.2% in real pesos (according to the technical team’s estimates).With the above results, the technical team not modify the estimated range of growth for 2013 as a whole (between 3.5% and 4.5%).",
        "This indicates that the economic growth in the second half of the year could be considerably higher than what was seen in the first.",
        "Note that the performance of investment in public works, housing construction, and public consumption is a source of high uncertainty for these forecasts Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) in November registered an annual growth rate of 13.30%, a level which is lower than the one seen the previous month (14.03%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency dropped from 13.74% in October to 13.48% in November and the one in foreign currency also went from 19.35% to 11.10%.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households registered an annual growth of 13.51% in November, which is slightly higher than the growth in the previous month (13.28%).",
        "This was due to the performance of mortgage loans which rose between October and November and went from 14.37% to 14.8%.",
        "Consumer loans, in turn, slowed down slightly as they went from growing at an annual rate of 12.66% to one of 12.45% during the same period.",
        "Regarding the commercial loan portfolio, its annual growth rate in November (13.32%) was lower than the rate for the month before (14.45%).",
        "This was due to the moderation in the national currency component (from 13.99% in October to 13.65% in November) and to the slowdown in the foreign currency component (from 18.85% to 10.16%).The interest rates for loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the policy interest rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -224 bp for mortgages, -206 bp for consumer loans, and -184 bp for building loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower rate of inflation.",
        "There have been reductions during this same period of: -163 bp for mortgages, -141 bp for consumer loans, and -124 bp for construction loans.The levels of the real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit, and loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign ContextIn the last few months, global activity has continued recovering mainly in the developed economies and to a lesser degree in some emerging countries in Asia.",
        "In general, the global activity indicators in the sectors of manufacturing and services remain in expansionary territory and global trade is showing signs of recovery.In the United States, the most recent figures on economic growth show that the economy expanded in the third quarter of the year at a rate that was better than that predicted by the analysts.",
        "Based on information as of November, retail sales and industrial production caught everyone by surprise on an upward trend and showed that the economy would continue expanding at a modest rate in the last quarter of the year.",
        "At the same time, the employment figures for the same month were encouraging and presented a favorable rate of hiring.",
        "Note that the US Congress also recently approved a plan that would avoid the implementation of certain automatic cuts in 2014 and 2015 and that would somewhat alleviate the fiscal discussions over the next few years.",
        "Thus in the coming quarters, the economy will face less fiscal debilitation and perhaps a little less uncertainty coming from this area.In the euro zone based on November figures, the indicators of business confidence and the activity indicators in the manufacturing and service sectors show signs of an economy expanding at a modest rate.",
        "There was also evidence of some divergence in the productive activity figures for the countries in the region.",
        "Specifically, while Germany is expanding at a favorable rate, some weakening of productive activity can be seen in France.",
        "In spite of the improvement in the confidence indicators, retail sales remain depressed, the labor market shows high unemployment rates, financial fragmentation is continuing, and credit is not showing any favorable signs.",
        "Thus, the region remains vulnerable to both internal and external shocks.In the case of the emerging economies, productive activity in China continued to expand at a favorable rate although one that is lower than what has been seen in the last 5 years.",
        "Based on information as of November, the performance of retail sales, exports, and production was better than expected.",
        "In Latin America, in turn, productive activity has continued to slow down in Chile while, in Brazil, it is expanding at a moderate pace.Regarding the international prices for petroleum, these have remained at relatively high levels in comparison to what was seen in the first half of year.",
        "This was a little above what was expected.",
        "In the case of foreign prices for coal and nickel, there has been some stability.",
        "The prices of coffee have continued to fall.",
        "Foreign prices for food, in turn, remained at relatively low levels with some minor upticks.Due to all of the above, inflation in the main developed economies is staying at low levels.This, together with an economic activity that is growing at a level below its potential, explains the monetary posture of their central banks.",
        "In the case of the emerging economies, the situation is more heterogenous.",
        "While some countries such as Colombia, Taiwan, and Korea have low declining inflation, others such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia are showing higher upswings in their price levels.The terms of trade declined in October but remain at high levels.",
        "No rise in these terms of trade is expected in a scenario of dilatory recovery of the global economy and better conditions expected in the global supply of petroleum.Finally, in their December 17-18 meeting, the Federal Reserve of the United States (FED) decided to reduce their purchases of financial assets by 10 billion USD beginning in January 2014.",
        "Thus, the FED would buy 40 billion in Treasury bonds and 35 billion in MBS.",
        "The favorable change in the labor market and in other economic and financial variables was the reason for this decision.",
        "Forward guidance on the conditions under which the rate for federal funds will rise was modified.",
        "It was stated that this rate will continue at low levels until after the unemployment rate drops below 6.5%, especially if the inflation projections remain below the long term target (2%).",
        "The FED insisted that the monetary policy posture will continue to depend on the evolution of the economy, especially the labor market and inflation.",
        "With respect to the predictions for growth and the unemployment rate, some improvements were presented for 2013 and 2014.So far, the reaction of some market indicators has not been very strong in view of the announcement.",
        "The interest rates of the United States public debt securities, the , and the dollar price with respect to the main currencies have shown no significant changes in their levels.",
        "A similar conclusion can be derived from the financial indicators in the emerging markets: the risk premiums, the price of the dollar in the local currency, and the interest rates for public debt securities have not changed substantially AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) The new information suggests that the world economy is recovering slowly and better than expected.",
        "In the United States, the GDP growth in the third quarter was revised upwards and the figures as of November were still showing a recovery but at a modest rate.",
        "The euro zone is probably growing again and the large emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are growing unevenly.",
        "(ii) In the United States, the Federal Reserve announced that it will purchase a lower amount in financial assets in January and reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the current level of interest rates for an extended period.",
        "(iii) The terms of trade declined in October, but they still remain at high levels.",
        "An increase in the terms of trade is not expected in a scenario of both a slow recovery in the global economy and better conditions expected for the worldwide supply of oil.",
        "(iv) In Colombia, the economic growth in the third quarter was higher than what had been estimated mainly due to growth in the construction sector.",
        "Public spending surged and household consumption grew steadily.",
        "The growth of exports was low and below the one for imports.",
        "From the beginning of the year to September, the GDP growth (3.9%) was similar to that projected by the technical team at the Banco de la República.",
        "(v) For the fourth quarter of 2013, the indicators of consumer confidence, economic expectations, retail commerce, and auto sales suggest that household consumption has been growing consistently.",
        "The upswing in mortgage lending also reflects a favorable dynamic for the investment in buildings.",
        "On the supply side, the industrial sector excluding coffee processing fell again in October (-0.1%) although at a slower rate than that recorded a month before.",
        "(vi) Due to the above results, the technical team not change the estimated growth range for 2013 as a whole (between 3.5% and 4.5%) of which 4.1% was the most likely figure.",
        "This means that economic growth in the second half of the year will be considerably higher than that registered in the first half.",
        "(vii) In November, the overall growth of loans slowed down although it continued to be higher than the rise in the nominal GDP.",
        "The majority of the nominal interest rates for loans declined over the month.",
        "In real terms, they are staying below their historical averages (except for credit cards) and are driving economic growth.",
        "(viii) Annual consumer inflation was at 1.76% in November, a figure that was lower than expected.",
        "This fact was mainly due to a slowdown in the annual change in the prices of regulated items and food.",
        "The average for core inflation remained stable at 2.46%.",
        "(ix) The inflation expectations economic analysts have for a year from now as well as those derived from the public debt paper with maturities of less than five years remained relatively stable and were below 3%.To summarize, economic growth in 2013 is expected to be similar to what was seen the year before.",
        "Interest rates are staying at levels that stimulate the economy’s aggregate expenditures.",
        "Having evaluated the balance of risks, the Board of Directors decided that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged.The members of the Board agreed that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged.",
        "Some emphasized the recent information on the strength of domestic demand, the growth of output, and the fact that the current monetary posture is expansionary, and that the inflation expectations for 12 months from now indicate they are anchored to levels that are close to the target.",
        "In addition, the low level of inflation is basically due to supply shocks with some transitory components.Another director stated that the information contained in the report indicates a positive performance of both the supply and the aggregate demand.",
        "Regarding the supply, the performance of production, prices, employment, and wages shows positive growth of the potential GDP.",
        "This is very likely to stay within the scope of the policy due to the high rates of investment and the effects of the reductions in payroll taxes on the labor market.",
        "From the point of view of the aggregate demand, recent information shows an upswing in both public and private growth.",
        "This will increase the probability that, with the current monetary policy posture, the output and inflation gaps will gradually close.Furthermore, another member thought that the fact that the growth rate of the GDP is increasing while the inflation rate is below the target and falling is a sign that the potential GDP could be higher than estimated, the lower, and the output gap more negative than has been indicated by the indices that have been calculated up to now.",
        "Therefore, it would be appropriate to assume the responsibility and communicate their commitment to keeping the interest rate unchanged for an extended period – at least until the middle of next year or even longer – until there is evidence that inflation is converging towards the target and the output gap is closing.Finally, other members added that in consideration of the fact that the current level of inflation has been below the target for several months, it is necessary to evaluate the coherence of the monetary policy rate in view of the indications that the potential GDP could be higher than estimated.",
        "Because of this, it could be necessary to make adjustments in order to hasten the convergence of inflation with the target and the closing of the output gap DECISIONThe Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the information available.Bogota, January 3, 2014",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on February 22, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and full-time co-directors Messrs.  Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo and César Vallejo Mejía.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached    BACKGROUNDa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation fell sharply in January, much more than anticipated by the market and by Banco de la República’s technical team.",
        "The outcome that month was 2.00%.",
        "This is 44 basis points (bp) less than the figure on record for December, a month that also witnessed a significant drop.",
        "As occurred throughout 2012, the slowdown in inflation was explained, once again, by less of an increase in the CPI for food and regulated items.In the food CPI, the annual change by January (1.69%) reflected a considerable decline (83 bp).",
        "The prices of all the major components of this basket slowed, and the reductions in VAT contemplated in the tax reform could have played an important role in that respect.",
        "Eating out is a case in point.",
        "After posting an annual variation of 5% or more during 2011 and 2012, this item dropped significantly in January, ending the month at 3.9% (100 bp less than in December).",
        "The 16% VAT on most of these services was eliminated and replaced by a consumption tax of 8%.",
        "Therefore, the indirect taxes were reduced in net terms.",
        "Added to this reduction are certain costs with minor adjustments in wages, rental income and public utilities.Annual inflation in processed foods was 2.2% by January as opposed to 2.8% in December.",
        "Here again, the VAT was lowered in the case of coffee, sugar and chocolate, with prices for these items dropping during the month compared to the situation in January of last year.",
        "Other prices were down as well (such as those for milk and eggs).",
        "Peso appreciation and lower international prices for certain foods during the second half of last year also were circumstances that contributed to the slowdown in the annual variation in this sub-basket.",
        "Lastly, the annual change in the CPI for perishables continued to decline (-5.0 in January as opposed to -3.9 in December).",
        "This was due to good weather and lower production costs.",
        "While prices for some commodities rose in January, as is customary, the increase was less compared to what it was in January 2012.As part of the non-food CPI, the annual change in regulated prices dropped to 0.67% in January (124 bp less than the figure at December).",
        "Most of the downward pressure originated with the COP200 cut in the price of gasoline when tax reform took effect.",
        "Similarly, prices for residential natural gas and intercity bus fares declined once again, due to little pressure from international fuel prices during the second half of last year, combined with accumulated appreciation of the Colombian peso.",
        "In the case of fares for urban public transportation, the adjustments were positive, but less than those witnessed during the same month last year.The other two non-food CPI components; that is, tradables and non-tradables, remained relatively stable in January.",
        "The annual change in the first of these sub-baskets went from 0.77% in December to 0.73% in January, a lesser reduction than what was observed at the end of 2012.",
        "Important disinflationary pressure on this sub-basket came from air fares, inasmuch as their CPI fell by 1.2% during the month.",
        "January also saw further reductions in prices for electrical, electronic and communication devices.",
        "This behavior continues to be explained by appreciation in the exchange rate (which came to an annual rate of 4.4% in January for the monthly average) and by scant pressure from international prices.The non-tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items rose marginally during the past month (by 2 bp) and stood at 3.94%.",
        "There were increases in tourism services, possibly related to the hike in VAT from 10% to 16% in the case of hotel services, as dictated by the tax reform.",
        "On the other hand, that reform implied a reduction in VAT from 10% to 5% on pre-paid medical care and other health expenses, which translated into price reductions for these items.",
        "With respect to rentals, the annual variation declined slightly, as has been the case for three months, and came to 3.8%.",
        "There were no major changes in the other items.Core inflation also declined in January for the fourth month in a row.",
        "The average of the four indicators calculated by Banco de la República came to 2.59%, which is 21 bp less than the December figure.In January, the annual change in the PPI remained in negative terrain, amounting to -2.15% (as opposed to -2.95% in December).",
        "The limited pressure from international prices up to -January, coupled with accumulated appreciation of the peso and lower tariffs, may explain these reductions during the last four months.As to inflation expectations, Banco de la República’s latest monthly survey of financial market analysts shows inflation expectations for December 2013 have declined to 2.65% (versus 2.82% last month).",
        "Even so, there were no important changes in expectations for inflation 12 months out (2.9%).",
        "A similar situation is evident in the case of expectations for non-food inflation (which are 2.46% for December 2013 and 2.61% 12 months out).",
        "The estimates derived from TES  at two, three and five years fell by nearly 20 bp after the January inflation figure was released, and have fluctuated between 2.5% and 2.7% in recent days.It is important to point out that much of the drop in inflation during January can be attributed to the reduction in VAT and other levies associated with implementation of the tax reform.",
        "The VAT shock tends to be temporary, affecting inflation for one year, at the end of which it may return to its initial level    GrowthOn the spending side, the success of retail sales during November, the slowdown in the annual growth in consumer lending given the December figures, and the stability of the consumer confidence indicator for the fourth quarter of 2012 are an indication that household consumption would have continued to perform more or less as it during the third quarter.",
        "This is reinforced by the performance of imports of consumer goods in dollars, which posted 14.7% annual growth at December.",
        "This represents an increase compared to the November figure, when these imports registered 4.3% annual growth.",
        "However, the aggregate figure for the year shows less growth compared to the full-year figure for 2011 (12.3% in 2012 as opposed to 25.7% the year before).In terms of investment, the figures on dollar imports of capital goods for industry (which, besides manufacturing, would include mining, commerce and construction, among others) rose 7% year on year during the fourth quarter and 10% by December, suggesting investment in machinery and equipment performed relatively well.",
        "Imports of transport equipment posted an annual drop of 27% during the fourth quarter, concentrated in December (57%).",
        "This was due partly to a high base of comparison in December 2011.",
        "Therefore, it is possible that investment in transport equipment (which accounts for 14.9% of total investment and 4.2% of GDP) may not have performed well during the final quarter of 2012.",
        "On the other hand, construction of works and buildings is still an item surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty in terms of how it will perform, particularly with respect to spending on works, construction and buildings.Total exports in 2012 (excluding re-exports of airplanes) came to US$ 60,235 million, which represents 5.8% growth compared to 2011.",
        "This performance is explained largely by the increase in mining exports (8% annual) and industrial exports (5.9%).",
        "On the other hand, exports of agricultural products declined 14% during the year, due to a 27% reduction in coffee exports.",
        "The rise in exports of industrial goods is attributed to added sales to Venezuela (52%), the United States (1.8%), Ecuador (1.7%) and the rest of Latin America (7.1%).",
        "Exports of this type to other destinations, such as Europe and Asia, posted negative variations during the year (22% and 3%, respectively).On the supply side, the latest data for the fourth quarter of 2012 confirm major differences in growth among the various sectors of the economy, but with trends similar to those witnessed during the third quarter.",
        "The most noticeable difference is between industry and commerce.",
        "While industrial production and other indicators for the sector suggest the contraction continued up to the end of the year, with an intensity that was greater than expected, the merchant surveys suggested growth.ANDI reported industrial production rose 0.7% during 2012 as a whole.",
        "With this information, it appears the data for December show a new contraction (in November, industrial production was up 1.0% year on year).",
        "According to the survey, manufacturers believe the major problems they faced in 2012 were the exchange rate, access to raw materials and low demand, in that order.",
        "The latter has gained ground as of -2011, but still remains slightly below its average level since 1997 and the increases have been more gradual than those observed in the 2008-2009 period.",
        "Likewise, with the information from the Fedesarrollo survey, the signals on industrial performance are not positive.",
        "In December, the indicator of industrial orders still was on a downward trend, while the inventory indicator (which is counter-cyclical) increased significantly last month, suggesting an unexpected accumulation of inventory.",
        "Furthermore, the indicator of production expectations at three months in December showed renewed deterioration.In contrast to the foregoing, the merchants surveyed in December by Fedesarrollo indicated no significant decline in their perception of the current situation for business or its future status.",
        "In fact, the trends in this series remain positive and the levels are relatively high.",
        "Moreover, retail sales have grown significantly, as mentioned earlier.With respect to construction, cement production remained sluggish in December, posting an annual contraction of 1.3%.",
        "Growth during 2012 as a whole came to 1.4%, as opposed to 13.4% in 2011.",
        "This fact, coupled with the data from showing a drop in new home sales nationwide by November, suggests low growth for the sector in the fourth quarter.Given all of the above, Banco de la República’s technical team maintains its forecast of 2.0% to 3.5% for fourth-quarter growth.",
        "The span of this range is due to uncertainty about the performance of investment in works, which has grown considerably, but without a definite bias.",
        "Nevertheless, the latest figures on industry and imports of transport equipment have surprised on the downside, so the central forecast likely is biased toward the lower part of that range.",
        "Similarly, the forecast for growth in 2012 as a whole would remain within a range of 3.3% to 3.9%.As for the expansion in GDP during the first quarter of 2013, unfavorable news has emerged in recent weeks that may curb growth.",
        "Coal is a case in point.",
        "The paralysis in production for the two most important companies in the sector (Cerrejon and Drummond) is a severe constraint to expansion in the mining sector at the start of the year.Similarly, in January, vehicle sales reported by Econometrics showed declines in levels with respect to the figure published twelve months earlier.",
        "This indicator rose at annual rates of -16.5% and signals to a poor start to the year for consumer durables.The favorable news during the first month of 2013 includes an increase in oil production to 1,012,000 barrels per day (BD).",
        "This is a record high figure that surpasses the forecasts in the last report (one million BD, on average).",
        "Also, in the case of coffee, production in January amounted to 877 thousand 60-kilo bags, which is 64% more than during the same period in 2012.",
        "The annual increase in the total demand for energy came to 4.6%.",
        "Similarly, the merchants surveyed by Fenalco maintained the positive trend in current sales, although sales expectations at six months showed some deterioration.",
        "Finally, another positive factor was consumer confidence as measured by Fedesarrollo, which rose in January compared to December, remaining at relatively high levels similar to those observed during the second half of last year.Banco de la República’s technical team is keeping the full-year forecast for 2013 at 2.5% to 4.5%, with 4% being the most likely figure.",
        "A slight acceleration compared to 2012 is expected, based on an international environment that would not deteriorate further, an expansionary monetary policy, continued growth in lending at a good pace despite the recent slowdown, and under the assumption that government spending and investment in works increases at a decent rate    Financial VariablesThe expansion in bank lending (/ and F/C) has stabilized.",
        "The annual growth rate for this variable went from 15.12% to 15.10% between October 2012 and January 2013.",
        "This is the result of a tradeoff between the slowdown in total loans in domestic currency (with a growth rate that went from 15.76% in October 2012 to 14.63% in January 2013) and the recovery in loans in foreign currency (with a growth rate that rose from 5.98% in October 2012 to 21.86% in January 2013).As to the different categories of lending, the annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio went from 13.2% to 14.1% between October 2012 and January 2013, bolstered largely by the loan portfolio in foreign currency.",
        "Meanwhile, the slowdown in lending to households continued.",
        "The increase in consumer loans declined from 18.64% to 17.01% between October 2012 and January 2013, while growth in the mortgage loan portfolio went from 15.47% to 14.72% during the same period.The nominal interest rates on all types of loans reflect a downhill trend compared to their levels at the end of July, when the benchmark interest rate began to be reduced.",
        "However, in real terms (discounting the non-food CPI), this descending trend has been curbed by lower inflation.",
        "Given this context, the real interest rate in January was 16.7% for disbursements on consumer loans, 10.2% on mortgages and 9.4% for ordinary commercial lending.",
        "All these rates are below their respective historical averages calculated since 2000.",
        "Meanwhile, the real interest rate on preferential commercial loans was 6.2%, as opposed to 27.4%, for credit card lending, and 5.8% for treasury loans.",
        "These rates exceed their averages since 2000    The External ContextDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, GDP in the Euro Zone contracted again and growth for the full year was -0.5%.",
        "Although this economic downturn was expected, its pace surpassed the central forecast contemplated in the December edition of Banco de la República’s Inflation Report (-0.4%).",
        "The reduced amount of growth in the region was due to a general decline in GDP, even in countries such as France and Germany, which performed comparatively well until 2011, compared to what was seen in the region.",
        "However, recent data on real activity in Germany demonstrates some recovery, driven partly by foreign trade with partners outside the Euro Zone.",
        "Also, certain indicators of business confidence and expectations for the region have improved somewhat in recent months (December and January).In the United States, the first estimate of 2012 growth was lower than the central forecast in the previous edition of Banco de la República’s Inflation Report.",
        "In the fourth quarter, the U economy contracted due to the drop in inventories, the momentum in government spending and less of a contribution from the external sector.",
        "Even so, there continued to be modest growth in consumption.",
        "During the month of January, the information on real activity showed an improvement in the country’s economic performance, as opinion indexes for the manufacturing and service sectors, and retail sales.In the case of the emerging Asian economies, the figures at the fourth quarter show the pace of their growth remained stable.",
        "As for China, real activity continued to grow in January at a favorable pace, particularly in the industrial sector and with respect to exports.As for the countries of the region, Brazil's economy is still recovering and the economies of Peru, Chile and Mexico continued to grow at a good pace.",
        "A sharp devaluation was decreed in Venezuela, a country that represented the leading destination for Colombian industrial exports and the second for food exports during 2012 (up to November).",
        "This fact could have an impact on industrial activity and the agricultural supply in Colombia, insofar as it becomes more difficult to export to Venezuela.Expectations with respect to an improvement in global activity, especially in China, coupled with broad international liquidity and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa,  have brought upward pressure to bear on international oil prices in recent weeks.",
        "On the other hand, food prices have not changed significantly during this period.",
        "Nevertheless, the low prices for coffee and coal and the slight increases in prices for imported goods witnessed during January caused a slight decline in terms of trade.Inflation, except in the specific cases of Brazil, India, Argentina and Venezuela, remains at low levels in both the developed and emerging economies.",
        "In a context of low inflation and weak growth, the central banks in the developed countries have maintained a policy of monetary stimulus.It is important to mention the case of Japan, where the central bank is committed to an inflation target of 2%.",
        "Although the deadline for that target is unclear, analysts have interpreted these announcements as a highly expansive monetary policy, in response to which the yen has depreciated sharply in relation to the United States dollar.The evolution of government debt markets in the peripheral European countries has been influenced by political uncertainty in Spain and Italy, which resulted in an increase in their risk premiums.",
        "Even so, these premiums are at low levels.In short, the latest fourth-quarter figures for 2012 show the global economy grew somewhat less than expected.",
        "However, earlier this year, several indicators of economic activity and expectations in large economies such as Germany, the United States and China, showed signs of recovery and may suggest a moderation in the global slowdown.",
        "Moreover, financial conditions have improved.",
        "Based on the foregoing, the forecast for demand from Colombia’s trading partners in the first half of 2013 remains weak, with a recovery in the second half of the year, as contemplated in the December edition of Banco de la República’s Inflation Report     AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors considered the following factors in its deliberations:(i) The growth of the world economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 was somewhat weaker than expected.",
        "However, so far during 2013, indicators of economic activity and expectations in some of the larger economies have been more positive and financial conditions have improved(ii)  International oil prices rose and are above the average observed in 2012.",
        "If the price remains at these levels, it could offset the low prices for coffee and coal and put terms of trade in 2013 above the average for 2012.",
        "(iii) In Colombia, the economic indicators for the fourth quarter of 2012 suggest private consumption rose slightly less than in the second and third quarters of that year.",
        "The uncertainty surrounding the behavior of investment remains high, particularly with respect to investment in works and building construction.",
        "On the supply side, the leading industrial indicators suggest a further drop in production in this sector during December, while the indicators for commerce point to acceptable growth.",
        "This being the case, Banco de la República’s technical team estimates economic growth in 2012 would be in a range between 3.3% and 3.9%.",
        "(iv) Economic growth in the first quarter of 2013 will be affected by fewer business days during the period, as well as supply shocks to coal exports and the risk of less demand from Venezuela.",
        "(v) In January, annual consumer inflation (2%) was lower than expected, particularly owing to less of an increase in the CPI for food and regulated items.",
        "The tax reform helped to reduce some of these prices, a fact that has a temporary impact on the annual change in the CPI.",
        "Part of this behavior also is explained by other factors such as lower production costs and moderate wage adjustments.",
        "(vi)  The average for both core inflation and inflation expectations is below the long-term target (3%).",
        "(vii) The slowdown in inflation, which was more than expected, occurred in the context of a negative output gap.",
        "This situation may keep inflation expectations at low levels for a longer period of time.",
        "It also reduces the likelihood that unanticipated increases generated by supply shocks could jeopardize compliance with the inflation target(viii) Lending continued to decelerate in January, but at a slower pace.",
        "Nominal interest rates on the different types of loans declined, with the exception of those on consumer lending, which rose during the month.",
        "In real terms, all the interest rates were up, partly because of the reduction in actual inflation and inflation expectations.In these circumstances, an assessment of the risk balance points to the advisability of lowering the intervention interest rate.",
        "The monetary policy action that has been taken is intended to place output near the economy’s productive capacity, without risking the inflation target or the country's macroeconomic stability     DECISIONPursuant to its assessment of the current risk balance, the Board of Directors unanimously agreed to lower the intervention interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "This decision takes into account the fact that the Colombian economy is growing below its potential, observed and forecast inflation are below the target of 3%, and there are no signs of upward pressure being brought to bear on inflation in the near future.The Board reiterated that Banco de la República has sufficient tools and resources to satisfy the economy’s regular liquidity needs with respect to both local and foreign currency, as well as any needs that might arise in an environment of international financial turmoil.The Board will continue its careful monitoring of performance and projections with respect to economic activity and inflation in Colombia, asset markets and the international situation.",
        "Finally, it reiterated that monetary policy will depend on new information as it becomes available.Updated: 18/03/2013",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on August 30, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2) AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation was 2.22% in July; this is 6 basis points (bp) more than the month before.",
        "During the first seven months of the year, the accumulated change in the CPI came to 1.77%, which is less than the change accumulated during the same period in 2012 (1.98%).The annual change in the food CPI was 1.6% in July, 30 basis points more than in June.",
        "The increase was concentrated in the perishable food basket (4.0% versus 2.4% in June); its annual growth has accelerated from a negative rate in February.",
        "For processed foods, the annual change in prices (0.06%) remained near zero for the third month in a row, after declining during the period from -2012 to early 2013.",
        "In this case, lower international prices for commodities such as wheat, corn and soybeans would have offset the effect of recent nominal depreciation of the peso.",
        "Moreover, the annual change in meals outside the home remained stable at 3.5%.As for the CPI excluding food and regulated items, July saw larger annual variations in tradables and non-tradables.",
        "In the first case, the increase (to 1.3% from 1.1% in June) adds to those observed in previous months and would be related, in part, to depreciation of the peso so far this year.",
        "The annual variation in non-tradables (3.9%) represented an increase of 12 bp from the previous month.",
        "In the case of rentals, the annual adjustment was up by 7 basis points compared to June, reaching 3.8%.July saw a sharp drop (of 61 bp) in the annual change in the basket of regulated items (to 1.4%), following three consecutive months of growth.",
        "This decline was concentrated mainly in electricity rates and, to a lesser extent, in public transportation.",
        "According to DANE, electricity was down by 5.5% during the month.The average of the four core inflation indicators monitored by Banco de la República came to 2.54% in July, which is similar to the average the month before (2.52%).",
        "This indicator has been quite stable at around 2.5% since February of this year.The annual change in the PPI stayed in negative terrain during July (-0.03%), but with an upward trend that began in April.",
        "The local and imported components increased with respect to the previous month (19 bp in both cases).There were no significant changes in inflation expectations during July.",
        "According to the Bank's monthly survey of financial market analysts, the rate anticipated for December of this year is still 2.6%, while the expectation 12 months out returned to 3.1%.Inflation expectations derived from the TES performance curve at horizons of 2, 3 and 5 years remained between 2.4% and 3.0%.",
        "These levels are similar to those observed in June GrowthThe latest information suggests household consumption would have expanded at a higher rate during the second quarter than in the first.",
        "The good levels for the consumer confidence indicator, which were similar in April and June to those registered at the end of 2011 and above the average for 2012, justify this forecast, as does the added momentum in commerce.",
        "With respect to commerce, the latest information reported by DANE shows retail sales in June posted an annual increase of 4.1% compared to the same month in 2012.",
        "The retail sales index for the second quarter as a whole was up 4.9% annually, which is more than the increase in the aggregate for the first three months of 2013 (0.8%).",
        "Another indicator that suggests a build-up in consumption is the total sales balance from the Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE, in Spanish) conducted by Banco de la República, which was at levels above the average for the first quarter.As for investment, the drop in imports of capital goods and the downturn in the balance of short-term and -term investment expectations noted in the EMEE continue to suggest mediocre performance, apart from investment in building construction and works.Total exports in dollars were down by 4% during the first half of the year with respect to the same period in 2012.",
        "A decline of 8% in mining exports, given a 29% drop in coal and 12.6% in gold, is the main reason for this outcome.",
        "Exports of agricultural goods also fell, although to a lesser extent (-2%), while exports of industrial goods and others posted 9% annual growth.During the first half of 2013, the total dollar value of CIF imports declined by 1%, due to fewer purchases of raw materials (-2.7%) and capital goods (-1.7%).",
        "On the other hand, imports of consumer goods rose 4.2% during the period.With respect to the various branches of economic activity, the decline in industry is expected to continue, although not as pronounced, while mining, construction, agriculture and commerce should perform well.The industrial production index, excluding coffee, dropped by 5.5% year on year at June.",
        "Given this figure, the second quarter was down 0.3% (following -6.6% in the first three months of the year), while the reduction for the year to date was -3.4%.The second-quarter figures for construction suggest continued growth.",
        "The annual rise in cement production was 0.71%, while shipments were up by 4.3%.",
        "Despite a decline in building permits during June, the cumulative figure for twelve month continued to increase by about 7.6%.Finally, in the agricultural sector, the recovery in coffee production, which rose at an annual rate of approximately 40% during the second quarter, coupled with an increase in the slaughter of cattle (3.3%), suggest a build-up in the sector compared to the first quarter.Given all these factors, the Bank’s technical staff’s not revise its forecast range for GDP growth in the second quarter, as presented in the last edition of the Inflation Report (between 2.5% and 4.0%, with 3.4% being the most likely figure).",
        "It is important to emphasize, once again, that the unpublished figures on works and public consumption show a high degree of volatility.",
        "So, a broad forecast range is justified.The information at hand for the third quarter of 2013 is limited, but does suggest the momentum in private consumption during the second quarter would continue or even improve.",
        "On the one hand, the consumer confidence indicator was lower in July than in June, but exceed the other levels on record so far in 2013 and the average since 2001.",
        "A breakdown by components shows household perception of current economic conditions is still relatively high, while medium and long-term consumer expectations remain stable.The leading indicators on the supply side, such as those for orders and inventory from the survey, point to some improvement, while industrialists expect production in the next three months (EOE) to remain at levels similar to what they were in recent months.",
        "The business confidence indicator in the manufacturing sector also improved.The annual increase in the total the demand for energy was 3.4% in July.",
        "The demand for unregulated industrial energy, which is closely correlated with industry, posted an annual increase of 1.1% (vs. -1.2% in June).",
        "This could suggest growth in the sector would have contracted less during July than in previous months.Oil production surpassed one million barrels per day (1.002 Mbd) in July, up from 974,000 in June.",
        "So far this year, production has increased by 7.2%.",
        "If that favorable performance were to be sustained, growth in this sub-branch would accelerate compared to 2012.In view of the foregoing, the Bank’s technical staff continues to forecast 3.0% to 4.5% growth for 2013 as a whole, with 4% being the most likely figure.",
        "The country's economic growth is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the programs being carried out by the national government Financial VariablesThe annual increase in bank lending (/ and F/C) came to 13.71% in July, slightly less than the month before (14.05%).",
        "Annual growth in the loan portfolio in domestic currency slowed from 12.85% to 12.45% between June and July, while the build-up in loans in foreign currency went from 35.56% to 37.07% during the same period.As for the different types of loans, those to households slowed, posting an annual rate of 13.27% growth by July, which is 44 bp less than the month before.",
        "This was due mainly to less of an increase in consumer lending (down from 13.66% in June to 12.90% in July), since the mortgage loan portfolio accelerated at an annual growth rate of 14.28% compared to 13.86% in June.",
        "The annual increase in loans to businesses dropped by 27 bp between June (13.95%) and July (13.70%).With respect to interest rates on loans disbursed by lending institutions, the reductions accumulated since the start of the policy rate cuts in July 2012 come to 230 basis points for mortgage loans, 209 bp for construction loans and 200 bp for consumer loans.By July, the real interest rates on consumer, mortgage, preferential, ordinary commercial and treasury commercial loans were below the respective historic averages calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the real rate on credit card lending was above average.The extent of the drop in real interest rates has been less, because of the impact of lower inflation, with reductions during the monetary stimulus period amounting to 194 bp on mortgage loans, 174 bp on loans for construction and 163 on consumer lending The External EnvironmentDuring the second quarter, GDP growth in the euro area was more than anticipated by the Bank’s technical staff.",
        "The added momentum in Germany and France, coupled with less deterioration in real activity in the economies of the periphery explain this outcome.",
        "The trend in business and consumer confidence indicators has been favorable so far during the third quarter, as has the trend in indicators of sentiment in the manufacturing and service sectors.",
        "If this continues, the recovery in real activity should persist throughout the second half of the year.",
        "However, the job market is still weak, and lending to the private sector remains depressed.In the United States, according to the latest methodological revision of the national accounts, GDP growth during 2011 and 2012 was higher than previously estimated.",
        "In contrast, the figures for the first quarter of 2013 show less of an expansion in real activity than was estimated originally.",
        "The second quarter witnessed better growth, which should continue unless prevented from doing so by the effect of the tax adjustments.",
        "The partial figures at hand for the third quarter indicate the economy has continued to grow at a modest pace.",
        "The trend in retail sales and consumer confidence remains favorable.",
        "Moreover, although industrial production is almost stagnant, the indicators of sentiment in the sector point to a recovery in the coming months.In the case of emerging market economies, information at the second quarter shows growth in the Asian countries was modest, with somewhat of a slowdown in Thailand and Indonesia.",
        "The figures on economic activity in the third quarter do not show the decline in China’s economy has continued.Economic growth in Latin America would be slightly less than expected.",
        "The GDP figures for the second quarter exhibit a sharp slowdown in Mexico and some moderation in Chile.",
        "In the case of Peru and Venezuela, growth accelerated, but is still quite limited in Venezuela.",
        "Brazil’s economy has continued to expand, although at a moderate pace.As for basic commodity prices on the international market, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa boosted oil prices, which are higher than those forecast by the Bank’s technical staff.",
        "Other commodities exported by Colombia, such as coal and coffee, have demonstrated relative stability in recent weeks.",
        "However, the outlook is less favorable for other commodities and minerals such as copper, silver and gold, and for some foods as well, which have seen recent price declines.",
        "Accordingly, thanks to oil price performance and lower prices for the food Colombia imports, no further reductions in the country’s terms of trade are anticipated, contrary to what might be happening in other parts of the region.With respect to the financial markets, the emerging economies continue to be affected by expectations of a gradual tapering off of the Fed’s stimulus program.",
        "The prices for the financial assets of this group of countries continued on a downward trend in recent weeks, amidst an environment of capital outflows and depreciation in their exchange rates.",
        "Exchange rate depreciation has been greater in the emerging economies that have large current account deficits financed with short-term foreign borrowing and high inflation rates.",
        "As a result, several emerging countries have sold off international reserves in significant amounts AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors considered the following relative aspects.",
        "(i) Second-quarter economic growth in the advanced economies was slightly better than anticipated.",
        "In contrast, growth in a good portion of the emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America has not lived up to expectations.",
        "Aggregate growth of Colombia's trading partners probably will be less than it was 2012.",
        "Something similar is expected for terms of trade, unless the recent upward trend in oil prices continues for an extended period of time.",
        "(ii) Volatility in the global financial markets has increased and has affected some emerging economies in particular.",
        "The anticipation of less extensive monetary expansion in the United States sparked a considerable hike in interest rates on sovereign bonds, starting from very low levels.",
        "The currencies of emerging economies, including the Colombian peso, have devalued against the dollar.",
        "It is possible this trend will continue and contribute to a better performance by the tradable sectors of the economy and, therefore, to more balanced economic growth.",
        "(iii) In Colombia, the new figures on foreign trade and internal demand point to added GDP growth during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the first.",
        "Household consumption and investment in works and buildings likely grew at a slightly higher rate.",
        "On the supply side, the increase in mining, agriculture and commerce would have accelerated, while industry would have contracted once again, although less so.",
        "(iv) Accordingly, the Bank’s technical staff kept its forecast for second-quarter growth within a range of 2.5% to 4.0%, with 3.4% being the most likely figure.",
        "For all of 2013, the range is still between 3.0% and 4.5%, with 4.0% being the most likely figure.",
        "Colombia’s economic growth is expected to increase over the course of the year to the extent that aggregate expenditure reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the programs the national government has been implementing.",
        "However, the downside risks to these projections have increased as of late.",
        "(v) The growth rates for bank lending have stabilized at levels above nominal GDP growth.",
        "In real terms, interest rates on the different types of loans are below their historical averages (except in the case of credit cards).",
        "However, the general financial conditions may have adjusted in response to the rise in the cost of external financing.",
        "(vi) In July, the annual inflation rate (2.2%) was somewhat lower than the Bank’s technical staff had estimated, and average core inflation remained relatively stable at 2.5%.",
        "The average of inflation expectations held by analysts and those calculated on the basis of government bonds is similar to the inflation target of 3%.The majority of the Board members felt it was appropriate to keep the policy rate at 3.25%, especially in light of the following factors.",
        "(i) There is information suggesting a recovery in aggregate demand during the remainder of the year, largely because of the current expansionary stance of monetary policy and the programs being implemented by the national government.",
        "This is indicated by the performance of production variables, such as retail sales and cement shipments, the results of surveys of consumer and business expectations, and the key job market indicators.",
        "(ii) In the global economy, the signals are mixed.",
        "While the developed economies are showing signs of recovery, growth in some of the emerging market economies has been less than expected.",
        "(iii) Colombia’s terms of trade remain high.",
        "(iv)The risk balance should consider the effect any additional monetary expansion would have on the economy’s vulnerability to negative shocks, especially given the current context of a future return to normal for external financial conditions.",
        "(v) In the coming month, relevant information will be available on the growth of the Colombian economy during the second quarter and on monetary policy decisions in the United States.Other members of the Board felt the policy interest rate should be reduced considering the following factors: (i) The downside risks to the forecasts for economic growth have increased.",
        "Aggregate growth for Colombia's trading partners probably will be less than in 2012 and something similar is expected for terms of trade.",
        "Moreover, the way domestic demand has performed recently does not point to closure of the output gap within the policy horizon.",
        "(ii)  Inflation forecasts and expectations show no significant risks that inflation will exceed the target of 3%.",
        "Under these conditions, it is possible and desirable to pursue a more expansionary monetary policy, so as to reduce the expected output gap in a context where there are no inflationary risks DECISIONHaving assessed the risk balance, the Board of Directors, by a majority vote, considered it appropriate to leave the benchmark rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue its careful monitoring of performance and projections on economic activity and inflation in Colombia, asset markets and the international situation.",
        "Finally, it reiterated that monetary policy will depend on new information as it becomes available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on June 28, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary prepared by the Bank’s technical staff on inflation and the economic situation with respect to growth and prospects for the future (Section 1) and a review of the policy discussions and options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2)     WITH TO AND GROWTHBackground Informationa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation was 2.00% in May, remaining just about stable compared to the rate in April (2.02%).",
        "Price hikes for several regulated items were offset by lower prices for processed foods and reductions in the non-tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items.Within the non-food CPI, one of the most notable aspects in May was the increase in the annual change in regulated prices (1.25% as opposed to 0.9% in April).",
        "This surge centered on electricity rates in several cities, including Bogotá.",
        "May also saw public transportation fares rise in other cities, such as Medellín.",
        "On the other hand, the annual change in fuel prices remained in negative terrain (-3.5%).There was a moderate increase in the annual variation in the tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items (1.06% versus 0.98% in April).",
        "Peso depreciation so far this year (approximately 9% between December 31 and June 24) has yet to pass through to this sub-basket.As for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items, the outcome in May (3.7%) reflects a drop of 9 basis points (bp) from the previous month.",
        "Most prominent was the reduction to 3.7% in the annual variation in rental fees (as opposed to 3.8% in April).",
        "This indicator has been declining very slowly, although with a few interruptions, since October of last year.The annual change in the food CPI by May (1.3%) was down 28 bp following consecutive hikes during the two preceding months.",
        "This decline was mainly the result of reductions in processed food prices (from 0.91% to -0.14%).",
        "In contrast, prices for perishables rose for the second month in a row (from 0.4% to 2.6%).",
        "The variation in prices for meals outside the home showed no change and remained at 3.3%.In May, the average of the four core inflation indicators tracked by Banco de la República fell slightly, reaching 2.44%, which is 4 bp less than the April figure.",
        "The four indicators have stayed between 2% and 3% since January of this year.The IPP maintained a negative annual variation in May (-2.1%), but increase compared to the month before (-2.4%).",
        "The change in prices for goods consumed and produced in Colombia, as well as for imported goods stayed in negative terrain.Inflation expectations rose slightly in May, but remained at levels consistent with meeting the target.",
        "The monthly survey conducted by Banco de la República indicates inflation is expected to be 2.6% by December of this year (7 bp higher than the expectation a month ago) and 3.1% at twelve months (an increase of 8 bp compared to April).",
        "On the other hand, the expectations derived from TES horizons of two, three and five years stayed between 2.5% and 3.0% GrowthGDP was up by 2.8% during the first three months of the year, in line with the midpoint of the forecast range presented in the previous quarterly inflation report.",
        "This result is related, in part, to the presence of fewer calendar and working days compared to the same period last year, but also to the various supply shocks witnessed in the mining sector.Most of the components of domestic demand slowed.",
        "The categories of investment in machinery and equipment and consumer durables contributed the most in that respect.",
        "In contrast, investment in building construction and works increased significantly (17.5% and 14.4%, respectively) partially offsetting the weakness in the other components.Both exports and imports declined compared to the same period in 2012.",
        "In the first case, the annual variation was -1.2%.",
        "A number of supply shocks to mining production seriously affected sales abroad, especially of coal.",
        "In the case of imports, the slowdown in annual growth to - 0.2% was mainly in foreign purchases of capital goods.On the supply side, construction and social, personal and community services were the sectors reporting the most annual growth: 16.9% and 4.5%, respectively.",
        "Mining growth remained low: 1.4%, due to the supply shocks affecting coal production, which declined 21% annually and offset the momentum in oil, which was up by 7.8%.",
        "The only major branch to post an annual contraction was industry (-4.1%).With respect to the second quarter of 2013, the available indicators with information at April show a generalized rebound in growth rates.",
        "Therefore, the momentum in private consumption is expected to be better in the second quarter than in the first.",
        "This follows the performance of retail sales.",
        "According to the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (, Spanish acronym) published by DANE, retail trade accelerated in April compared to the March figures and to the average for the first three months.",
        "In fact, retail sales rose at an annual rate of 5.7% (versus 0.8% and 0.9% in March and first quarter, respectively).",
        "For March and April, the growth in retail sales was 3.1%, which is better than what was observed in January and February of this year and similar to the rate in the fourth quarter of last year.",
        "In results of Banco de la República’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE, Spanish acronym) lean in the same direction, with the data up to April showing sales expectations are higher, on average, than they were during the first quarter.",
        "On the other hand, according Econometrics, automobile sales in April were up by 3.3% and fell 10.4% in May.",
        "This latest drop is less pronounced than the decline witnessed in the first quarter.",
        "Finally, the consumer confidence index (CCI) published by shows higher levels in April and May than those observed in the first three months of 2013, and is above the historical average for the series (since 2001).As for the indicators associated with supply, the signals were mixed.",
        "The industrial production index rose 8.4% in April.",
        "However, the trend component of the series continued to decline slowly.",
        "Consequently, the months of March and April continued to see a drop of 1.6% annually and 2.7% for the year to date.",
        "Although the indicators of orders and inventories from the industrial survey showed a slight rebound in April, they continued to exhibit a downward trend.",
        "Something similar occurred with the balance of expectations for production three months out, which suggests industry would remain weak going forward.In relation to construction, with the data at April, building licenses were up by 36.4% (divided between 39.1% for housing and 27.7% for other types of construction), while cement production and shipment rose 4.2% and 16.4%, respectively.",
        "These last two items had not seen positive growth since November of last year.Coal exports in April posted a rise of 27.9% in volume and 11.2% in value (USD).The limited amount of data available at May show performance was less favorable than in April, but better than in February and March.",
        "Oil production increased 8.3% annually and remained above one million barrels per day, while coffee production registered 36% annual growth, following 67% in April.",
        "The demand for energy rose 2.6% annually.In general, growth of the Colombian economy is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the programs being carried out by the national government.",
        "The Bank's technical staff continues to forecast GDP growth for 2013 at 3.0% to 5.0%, with 4.3% being the most likely figure Financial VariablesIn May, bank lending (/ and F/C) maintained the annual growth rate witnessed the month before (14.0%).",
        "The build-up in the annual variation in the loan portfolio in domestic currency, which increased from 12.58% in April to 12.68% in May, was off-set by the slowdown in the foreign currency portfolio, which went from 36.26% to 34.67% growth during the same period.As for the different types of loans, performance was mixed.",
        "The annual increase in consumer lending went from 15.65% to 14.47% between April and May, while the annual variation in the mortgage portfolio increased from 13.68% to 13.82 % during the same period.",
        "The latter is associated with use of the home purchase subsidy decreed by the government as of April.",
        "Contrary to what was observed since the fourth quarter last year, the domestic component of commercial loans experienced an increase in annual growth during this period, (from 10.97% to 11.16%); this meant a slight recovery in the total from 13.46% to 13.51%.The nominal interest rates applied by lending institutions to all types of loans continued the downward trend that began with the policy rate cuts initiated in July 2012.",
        "The highlights in terms of the response by May include the prime lending rate (-238 bp), the mortgage rate (-203 bp) (partly due to government backing for home purchases), the ordinary commercial rate (-201 bp) and the rate for home construction (-190 bp), following by reductions in the consumer loan rate (-177 bp), microcredit (-174 bp) and the rate on credit card lending (-134 bp).Interest rates also declined in real terms, but to a lesser extent, due to the effect of the slump in inflation.",
        "The decline, since July 2012, amounts to -185 bp on preferential loans, -150 on mortgage loans, -148 bp on ordinary commercial loans, -138 bp on loans for construction, -122 bp on consumer loans, and -112 bp on microcredit.In May, the real interest rate was 15.3% for consumer loans, 8.5% on mortgages, 4.5% for preferential lending and 7.8% on ordinary commercial loans.",
        "These levels are below the respective historic averages calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the real rate on credit card lending, at 26.1%, was above average.",

        "Although the European contraction persists, prospects in the United States and Japan are more favorable.",
        "A good many of the emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are experiencing robust growth, but less than was forecast in previous reports.In the United States, the momentum in the private sector offset the contractionary effects of the fiscal adjustment and allowed the economy to grow by about 2%.",
        "With the figures at May, the indicators of consumption in that country, including household confidence, continued to support a gradual recovery.",
        "Meanwhile, industry showed some weakening during that month, although the figures advanced to June suggest it would not persist.",
        "In contrast, the recovery in the housing and job markets continues.In the euro zone, productive activity continued to deteriorate, although at a slower pace.",
        "In this sense, the confidence indicators on the part of both businessmen and consumers have rebounded a bit in recent months, but are still at a very low level.",
        "On the less positive side, retail sales continue to deteriorate, as do the job markets, especially those in the peripheral economies.",
        "In Germany, productive activity seems to be gaining momentum; the indicators of confidence and manufacturing activity have been rising for several months.",
        "This situation would contribute to the recovery of the region.The pace of growth in the emerging economies will be slower than during the 2011-2012 period.As for international prices, oil prices have been relatively stable in recent weeks.",
        "In the case of other goods exported by Colombia, such as coal, coffee and ferronickel, prices are still below the average levels witnessed in 2012.",
        "In terms of prices for imported commodities, international food prices also are at levels below those of the previous year.",
        "This suggests the level of terms of trade will be favorable this year, but below the average observed in 2012.",
        "In a context of modest pressure on global inflation and weak growth, monetary policy in most of the developed and emerging economies remains expansionary.Recently, the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a possible tapering off of asset purchases, due to improved economic performance, heightened the volatility on international financial markets.",
        "The long-term rates on bonds of the advanced and emerging economies have risen, starting from a low level.",
        "Stock prices have fallen and the dollar has gained strength.",
        "The reaction of the markets has been more pronounced in the emerging countries, which have seen a rise in the risk premium.If there is less monetary stimulus in a context of gradual recovery in the United States, as the Fed announced, the impact on emerging economies, and especially on Latin America, could be low.",
        "Added momentum in the U economy would imply more external demand, as well as favorable international prices.",
        "If this scenario were to materialize, the fundamentals of the economies in the region should not change substantially, terms of trade would remain at relatively high levels, and flows of foreign direct investment would continue.",
        "Therefore, a reduction in portfolio investments is likely, given expectations of less growth in global liquidity.",
        "This does not necessarily imply a substantial decline in domestic and external financing in the region     AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration.",
        "(i) The global economy continues to show mixed signals.",
        "While the European contraction is likely to persist longer than was expected previously, the outlook in the United States and Japan is more favorable.",
        "The growth of many of the emerging economies in Asia and Latin America is robust, but less than was forecast several months ago.",
        "(ii) The Federal Reserve’s announcement of a possible tapering off of asset purchases heightened the volatility on international financial markets.",

        "Stock prices have fallen and the dollar has gained strength.",
        "The reaction of the markets has been more pronounced in the emerging economies.",
        "(iii) The behavior of prices for Colombia’s leading export commodities suggests the level of terms of trade will be favorable this year, but below the average observed in 2012.",
        "(iv) In the domestic context, GDP growth during the first quarter of 2013 (2.8%) matched the technical staff’s estimate.",
        "Domestic demand slowed, due to less growth in consumption, which was partly offset by stronger momentum in investment in building construction and works.",
        "For the second quarter, the figures on industry and commerce, consumer confidence, as well as oil and coffee production suggest more growth than in the first three months of the year.",
        "(v) As for loans and the cost of financing, the volatility on international markets was reflected in a rise in interest rates on government borrowing and private bonds.",
        "The increase in bank loans in domestic and foreign currency is showing signs of stabilizing at a higher rate than nominal GDP growth.",
        "Interest rates on loans continue to decline and, in real terms, are below their historic averages (except in the case of credit card lending).",
        "(vi) In general, growth of the Colombian economy is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the programs being carried out by the national government.",
        "The Bank's technical staff continues to forecast GDP growth for 2013 at 3.0% to 5.0%, with 4.3% being the most likely figure.",
        "(vii) Annual inflation in May (2%) was similar to what it was in April.",
        "Average core inflation declined and was 2.4%.",
        "Analysts’ average inflation expectations and those resulting from government bonds are similar to the inflation target (3%).In short, growth of the Colombian economy in the first quarter was low and equal to the forecast.",
        "The monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted so far are expected to help place output near its potential level during the course of the year.",
        "Similarly, inflation very likely will end up within the target range     DECISIONPursuant to its assessment of the current risk balance, the Board of Directors unanimously agreed to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue its careful monitoring of performance and projections with respect to economic activity and inflation in Colombia, asset markets and the international situation.",
        "Finally, it reiterated that monetary policy will depend on new information as it becomes available.Bogotá,",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on April 26, 2013.",
        "It was attended by Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaria, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary prepared by the Bank’s technical staff on the situation with respect to inflation, economic growth and prospects for the same (Section 1), plus a review of the policy discussion and options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2) WITH TO AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationIn March, the downward trend in annual consumer inflation came to a halt after nine months.",
        "The rate was 1.91%, up eight basis points (bps) from the previous month.",
        "The rise in inflation during March was due mainly to the acceleration in price changes for the food basket.",
        "As to the non-food CPI, the outcome varied little compared to the previous month.",
        "The price variation for tradables gathered speed, offsetting the sharp decline in prices for the basket of regulated items.With respect to the annual change in the food CPI, the downward trend observed for several months came to an end and the rate in March was 1.4%, up 22 basis points from the month before.",
        "Perishables were the group that accelerated the most (having gone from -5.6% in February to 1.9% in March), but remained in negative terrain.",
        "Processed foods and dining out dropped off respectively from 1.6% in February to 1.3% in March and from 3.6% in February to 3.2% in March.Within the non-food CPI, the basket of non-tradables excluding food and regulated items remained at 3.9%, as its main component: rentals.",
        "Both these rates had been declining slowly since November of last year, possibly because pressure from demand has been scant for several quarters, coupled with the decline in inflation expectations, among others.As for the tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items, the annual change increased (from 0.7% in February to 1.1% in March), contrary to the situation in previous months, when it was stable.",
        "This is explained, to some extent, by peso depreciation during the year, which would have begun to pass through to consumer prices.March saw a continued decline in the annual variation in regulated prices.",
        "The outcome for that month was 0.2%, versus 0.7% in February.",
        "Once again, electrical power rates dropped sharply.There were no significant changes in the core inflation indicators during March.",
        "The average of the four indicators monitored by Banco de la República was 2.52% compared to 2.49% in February.The annual variation in the PPI stayed in negative terrain during March (-1.9%) despite the increases witnessed during the last three months.",
        "This may be associated with the pass through of depreciation to the imported components of the PPI.Measurements of inflation expectations remain low.",
        "According to the monthly survey of market analysts conducted by Banco de la República, the expectation for December of this year is 2.6% inflation, which is slightly lower than the expectation last month.",
        "Expectations twelve months out are for 2.9%, having demonstrated no change in recent months.",
        "The quarterly business survey conducted in early April indicates inflation is expected to reach 2.8% by December 2013.",
        "The estimates based on fixed-rate TES and UVR point to inflation of between 2.5% and 2.7% at horizons of two to five years    GrowthAvailable indicators for the first quarter suggest economic activity had slowed.",
        "Household consumption would have grown less than in the fourth quarter of 2012, as the following facts suggest.",
        "According to DANE, February retail sales were up at an annual rate of 0.6%, down from the 1.3% increase in January and the average of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012.",
        "The figures so far this year point to a standstill in sales trends compared to the situation towards the end of last year (discounting automobile sales, the annual growth rate was 2.9%).",
        "On the other hand, the consumer confidence index published by showed a sizeable drop in the level for February, although the level in March was maintained.",
        "As a result, the average for this index in the first quarter is less than it was during the fourth quarter of 2012.",
        "Meanwhile, the consumer loan portfolio continued to slow, with annual growth averaging 16.5% in the first quarter as opposed to 18.4% during the final quarter of 2012.",
        "In real terms, this trend has held.Investment could be expected to recover, given the good momentum in imports of capital goods on average between January and February (growth was 9.0% in real terms, compared to -8.7% in the fourth quarter).Colombian exports by February 2013 were down 6.6% from the same month last year.",
        "This is explained by the decline in major exports originating with mining (-11.9%) and agriculture (-6.3%).",
        "In contrast, the group of industrial exports and “others” posted an annual increase of 13.4% in February.",
        "Once again, exports of vehicles and automotive parts made an important contribution, having risen 354% that month.",
        "Other highpoints are the increase in exports of electrical machinery and apparatus (38%) and meat (167%).On the supply side, the available indicators for industry continue to show deterioration in the sector.",
        "The annual change in the IPI by February (coffee milling excluded) was -4.5%, which is similar to what was expected.",
        "It is important to note this performance would be related, in part, to one less calendar day in February compared to the same month last year.",
        "Business confidence also dropped off during the first quarter to levels below those witnessed at the end of last year.",
        "The indicators for orders and inventory show deterioration in the sector, as expectations for production three months out.Several of the figures for commerce and construction suggest slowdowns in these sectors as well.",
        "According to the survey, the current situation and merchants’ expectations at six months signal some deterioration in the sector.",
        "As for construction, cement production posted an annual drop of 4.8%.",
        "With that, its tendency component continues to fall.A decline in the production of coal is expected due to supply shocks during February and March.",
        "However, for mining activity as a whole, the rise in oil production should partially offset that negative effect.",
        "Oil production rose sharply during the first three months of the year, reaching 1,008 thousand barrels per day, with 8.5% annual growth.For its part, coffee production would have accelerated between January and March 2013 (by 26% on average).",
        "This is according to the National Federation of Coffee Growers and despite the strike and the problems reported by growers.It is important to bear in mind there were fewer working days during the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2012.",
        "This was due to Easter Week in March and one day less in February.",
        "In the past, similar situations have had a significant impact on first-quarter economic growth figures.",
        "As a result, it has been difficult to interpret current economic trends and to forecast economic activity.However, economic growth is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the investment and spending programs announced recently by the central government.",
        "The Bank's technical staff forecasts between 3.0% and 5.0% GDP growth for 2013 as a whole, with 4.3% being the most likely figure    Financial VariablesThe expansion in bank lending (/ and F/C) continued to abate, following five months of relative stability.",
        "The annual increase by March was 14.2%, down 95 bp from the previous month.",
        "The loan portfolio in domestic currency went from 14.4% to 13.2% annual growth between February and March.",
        "However, annual growth in the loan portfolio in foreign currency rebounded from 24.8% to 29.4%.All types of lending expanded less during March, in annual terms, compared to the previous month.",
        "Specifically, annual growth declined from 14.2% to 13.2% for commercial loans, from 16.9% to 15.6% for consumer lending, and from 14.5% to 14.1% for mortgage loans.Nominal interest rates on loans of all types exhibited a downward trend with respect to their levels at the end of July 2012, when the benchmark rate cuts began.",
        "Up to March, the principal reaction was in the rates on consumer lending (-165 bp), preferential loans (-152 bp) and micro-credit (-182 bp).",
        "Mortgage rates declined to a lesser extent (-94 bp), as those on credit card lending (-73 bp), ordinary commercial loans (-104 bp) and lending for home construction (-124 bp).In March, the real interest rate on consumer loans was 15.6% as opposed to 9.8% on mortgages, 5.6% on preferential loans and 8.9% on regular commercial lending.",
        "All these rates are below their historical averages calculated since 2000.",
        "On the other hand, real interest rates on credit card and treasury loans were 26.9% and 5.2% in that order, surpassing the respective averages calculated since 2000    The External SituationThe various indicators of industrial production, consumption, employment and lending suggest overall economic activity during the first quarter of 2013 remained sluggish.",
        "The slow expansion of the global economy is due to weak economic growth in the developed countries, as mirrored in high levels of unemployment and growing doubts about fiscal sustainability in several of those economies.",
        "In contrast, the emerging economies continue to display favorable momentum, although some are beginning to show signs of a slowdown due to weakening global demand and the negative impact this has on commodity prices.The euro zone is still the least dynamic region.",
        "Performance figures for its productive sector show a new decline in gross domestic product during the first quarter of 2013.",
        "This is consistent with the movement in indicators of business sentiment for the manufacturing and service sectors, which experienced further deterioration in recent months, and the indicators of industrial and retail activity, which continued to wane in annual terms.",
        "Although the measures adopted in the euro zone improved financial conditions in the region as of the second half of 2012, the credit channel remains blocked by the mistrust with which financial intermediaries have responded to economic developments.In the United States, the news is slightly more favorable.",
        "Annual growth in output during the first quarter of 2012 came to 2.5%, as opposed to 0.4% in the final quarter of last year.",
        "Household consumption and the manufacturing and service sectors continued to grow, while the housing market remained on the road to recovery, but still from relatively low levels.",
        "However, several figures for March and April show demand is weakening, apparently due to the impact of the fiscal adjustment and dwindling demand worldwide, which would be affecting US export performance.Meanwhile, in the emerging economies, China’s growth during the first quarter of the year was less than what analysts expected and slackened with respect to the fourth quarter of 2012.",
        "The drop-off in industry, retail sales and exports during the first part of the year is evidence of this slowdown.",
        "An important consequence of that decline is the reduction in China’s imports of raw materials and commodities.",
        "This trend, witnessed since late 2010, affects the performance of most emerging economies that had found an important market for their products in China.In the case of Latin America, the economies of Chile, Mexico and Peru continued to grow at a favorable rate, but have begun to show signs of weakness, especially in the case of Chile and Mexico.",
        "In Brazil, the pace of industrial recovery slowed during February.",
        "Nevertheless, growth in the Brazilian economy during 2013 is expected to surpass last year’s rate (0.9%).",
        "Other economies in the region, such as Venezuela and Ecuador, would decelerate compared to the previous year.As to international commodity prices, the weakness of the world economy caused oil prices to plunge in recent weeks.",
        "In the case of other goods exported by Colombia, such as coal, nickel and coffee, prices are below the average for 2012.Lower international commodity prices, especially for energy, have eased inflationary pressures in the global economy and suggest there is little risk on this front in the near future.",
        "Coupled with the expectation of weak global growth, this indicates monetary policy in the developed economies and in several emerging markets would remain expansive.",
        "It is worth noting the Central Bank of Japan announced a policy on quantitative easing that would imply doubling the monetary base over the next two years.",
        "It would increase from approximately 30% of GDP today to over 60% by 2015.In short, the forecast is for weaker economic activity worldwide during 2013 compared to 2012.",
        "Terms of trade are expected to be less than those on record for last year, breaking the upward trend observed in previous years.",
        "If these trends continue, the external impetus to the Colombian economy in 2013 could be less than in past years AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors took the following relevant factors into account in its deliberations.",
        "(i) On the international scene, indicators of economic activity in the first quarter show modest growth in the United States, Europe in recession, and a slight slowdown in China.",
        "Moreover, in Japan, the central bank announced a forceful monetary stimulus program.",
        "(ii)  If the current trends in the international economy continue throughout the year, terms of trade and average growth for Colombia's trading partners probably will slacken a bit compared to 2012.",
        "As a result, the external boost to aggregate spending would be less than in previous years.",
        "(iii) The first-quarter figures suggest economic activity in Colombia has slowed compared to what was observed in 2012.",
        "On the demand side, household consumption would have grown at a slower pace, as evidenced by the changes in indicators of retail trade, household confidence and lending.",
        "On the supply side, the available indicators for industry continue to show deterioration.",
        "In February, exports in US dollars fell year on year, mainly due to mining exports and those affected by supply shocks in the coal sector.",
        "In contrast, industrial exports rose at a good pace.",
        "(iv)  The recent trend in several components of aggregate spending, coupled with the effect of fewer working days during the first quarter compared to the same period last year, has made it particularly difficult to interpret current economic trends and to forecast economic activity.",
        "Nevertheless, economic growth is expected to increase throughout the year to the extent that aggregate spending reacts to the monetary policy measures adopted earlier and to the investment and spending programs announced recently by the central government.",
        "The Bank's technical staff forecasts between 3.0% and 5.0% GDP growth for 2013 as a whole, with 4.3% being the most likely figure.",
        "(v)  In March, annual inflation (1.91%) accelerated slightly and the core inflation rates exhibited no significant changes.",
        "The average of these measurements is below target (3%), as are most indicators of inflation expectations.",
        "(vi) By March, the benchmark interest rate cuts had passed through to nominal interest rates in the market.",
        "Those on consumer lending, microcredit and preferential loans reacted to a similar extent or more than the Bank’s rate, while interest rates on ordinary commercial loans, mortgages and credit card lending were slower to respond.",
        "However, recent weeks have seen a significant reduction in interest rates on home mortgages.",
        "In real terms, rates have declined less due to the sharp drop in inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "(vii) Loan portfolio growth continued to abate.",
        "So far this year, there has been a slowdown in commercial loans in domestic currency, but an increase in financing through corporate bond issues, coupled with more external borrowing.",
        "Lending to households (consumer and mortgage loans) also grew less, but at rates superior to those of nominal GDP.",
        "(viii) By December, the price indexes for new and existing homes continued to rise at elevated rates, reaching historic highs.In short, the Colombian economy currently is growing below its potential and inflation is under 3%.",
        "The monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted in 2013 will help to place output near the economy’s productive capacity and move inflation towards the long-term target.",

        "Recent Developments in InflationThere was a substantial decline in the annual consumer inflation in October and one that was significantly larger than expected.",
        "The result for this month was 1.84%, 43 basis points (bp) less than what was registered in September.",
        "So far this year the increase comes to 1.89% which is lower than the accumulated rise for the same period last year (2.48%).",
        "The decline of inflation in October was mainly concentrated in food and secondly in the regulated component.In food, the annual variation slowed down significantly (139 bp compared to the record for September) and was at 0.7% at the close of the month.",
        "The decrease was concentrated in perishables where significant drops were seen in the prices for potatoes and a large variety of other products (tubers, vegetables, and fruit).",
        "A good supply of agricultural products together with limited rises in the costs of production and transportation are still the explanation for the small relative increases in these prices in October as well as in previous months.",
        "Another item that presented a decline during the month was that of meals away from home (from 3.7% to 3.3% annually).",
        "Last of all, the prices of processed goods not show any relevant change last month and their annual variation remained at 0.0%.",
        "In recent months, the international prices of grain, oil, and other food have dropped which is part of the reason for the low upward pressure that has been seen for this group of goods.The annual change in the CPI excluding food in October was at 2.31%, 5 bp lower than the month before.",
        "The 17 bp decline in the annual change in the CPI for regulated goods in October (1.1%) is noteworthy.",
        "This variable has seen decreases since July due to the limited rises or drops in the prices of fuel primarily and, to a lesser degree, the fees for various utilities.",
        "In the case of fuel, the recent reductions, which were -3.6% annually last month, are partly related to the few upswings that have been registered in international prices for several quarters and above all to the drops starting in August.",
        "Respecting the fees for utilities, there were small adjustments to gas and water and reductions for electricity in October.",
        "So far this year the rise in these items has been 2.5%, which is low compared to what was registered in previous years.",
        "This could be due to the decisions to lower the fee for water and garbage collection in some cities, the performance of the international prices for fuel, and the drop in the PPI, etc.In October, the annual change in the CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items remained almost unchanged at around 3.7%.",
        "The annual variation for rent declined slightly (3 bp) as it has been doing since the beginning of the year while no important changes in the other components of the basket were registered.",
        "At the same time, the annual change in the CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated items stayed at 1.3% in October.",
        "In recent months, the depreciation of the peso has been reflected in a moderate upswing in this indicator and in rises (although slight) in the prices of some imported goods.Core inflation declined again in October.",
        "The average of the four indicators monitored by the Bank was at 2.44% in comparison to 2.51% for the previous month.",
        "Since February of this year, this measurement has shown very few variations.The annual change in the PPI went from -1.3% in September to -1.9% in October.",
        "The local component dropped with respect to the previous month (56 bp) in a wide range of goods.",
        "Imports rose 0.9% annually, a figure that is lower than what was registered the month before (1.6%).With respect to inflation expectations, according to the Bank’s monthly survey of financial market analysts, inflation expected for December of this year is 2.2% while the expectations for the coming 12 months are at 2.9%.",
        "This is lower than those for the previous month.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations derived from the yield curve of the TES for different maturities are at levels below 3%.",
        "Compared to the month before, those derived from 2 and 3 year paper declined while the 5-year ones rose GrowthThe latest information available indicates that some areas of domestic demand were expanding at a moderately positive rate in the third quarter.",
        "Household consumption continued to be strong while investment in machinery and equipment may have performed well over the period.",
        "Uncertainty with respect to information on the construction of buildings, public works projects, and public consumption persists.According to the most recent information reported by DANE, the index of total commercial sales grew 4.9% in annual terms between July and September.",
        "This figure is similar to the one registered for the second quarter aggregate (5.1%).",
        "The balance of sales from the regional survey done by the Banco de la Republica (EMEE) also suggests that the expansion of household consumption continued at a positive rate during the third quarter.With respect to investment other than investments in building construction and public works projects, both the balance of investment expectations from EMEE and the expansion in imports of capital goods in real pesos suggest that their performance may have been somewhat better than what was registered in the second quarter of 2013.In the month of September, in turn, the total exports registered an annual drop of 1.2% in dollars due to the lower sales of mining products (-2.4%).",
        "This decline was slightly offset by the 10% growth in agricultural exports and 0.1% growth in industrial exports.Total imports (CIF) in dollars climbed 10% compared to the same month last year.",
        "This performance is due to the larger purchases of capital goods (15%) and of raw materials (13%) since the purchases of consumer goods fell 1.1%.In the area of supply, the most recent indicators for the third quarter suggest a mixed performance.",
        "In the case of industry, the annual change for the IPI excluding coffee bean threshing in September was -1.8%, which is in line with what was expected.",
        "With this, the third quarter registered a 1.9% decline and -2.7% for the year so far.However, in September the number of construction licenses rose in comparison to the previous month (18.9%) and the accumulated growth for 12 months was at 10.6% (in June it was 7.3%).",
        "The production of cement and shipments, in turn, surged between the second and third quarters.",
        "Cement production went from growing 0.7% annually in June to 5.9% in September.",
        "The shipments grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the third quarter compared to their 4.3% growth in the second quarter.Thus, the strongest sectors in the third quarter are expected to be construction and agriculture.",
        "Others that may have contributed significantly to the growth are financial services, commerce, and mining.",
        "In contrast, the industrial sector (including coffee bean threshing) would be the one that contributed the least to the growth of output.The above makes it possible to maintain a forecast range of 3.8% to 5.2% for the growth of the GDP in the third quarter.",
        "It should be pointed out that the uncertainty about investment in public works projects, public consumption, and housing construction remains high due to the lack of information.There is still very little information on the fourth quarter.",
        "In the month of October, the recovery in the consumer confidence index (CCI) published by Fedesarrollo is notable as is the surge in vehicle sales.",
        "In the first case, the was once again above the average it has held since 2001 after having overcome the shocks that significantly affected the perception and expectations of households in the month of August.",
        "Sales of vehicles, in turn, rose 10.2% in October in comparison to the same month last year.",
        "This indicates a surge with respect to what was registered on average for the third quarter (-0.6%).For the fourth quarter, the most favorable news comes from the sectors of agriculture and energy.",
        "Specifically, according to the figures from the National Federation of Coffee Growers, coffee production showed a 62% expansion in October after having grown about 52% in the third quarter.",
        "In addition, the recovery in the annual variation of the total demand for energy stands out.",
        "This went from 1.2% in September to 3.5% in October.Based on the information for October, the Fedesarrollo survey of business opinion (EOE) indicates an improvement in the indicators for confidence, orders, inventory, and expectations for industry for the coming three months.",
        "Furthermore, the demand for non-regulated electricity for industry, a variable that is highly correlated with the IPI, reported a 5.4% expansion in October (compared to -0.8% in September).",
        "The preceding may suggest a better performance for the sector for the month following it and a more favorable outlook for the end of the year.With all of the above, the forecast range of 3.5% to 4.5% is maintained for all of 2013.",
        "Note that the performance of investment in public works projects, housing construction, and public consumption is a source of great uncertainty for these forecasts Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) in October registered an annual growth rate of 14.13% which is close to the average seen since March (14.02%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency climbed from 13.18% in September to 13.74% in October and the one in foreign currency went from 26.91% to 20.61% during the same period.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households registered an annual growth in October of 13.07%, which is higher than the growth in the previous month (12.81%).",
        "This was the result of the performance of consumer loans which went from 12.37% to 12.61% as well as mortgages where the annual growth of 14.05% in September went to 14.37% in October.",
        "Regarding the commercial loan portfolio, the annual growth rate in October (14.45%) was similar to the one for the previous month due to a surge in the component in national currency (from 13.13% in September to 13.99% in October) which offset the slowdown in the foreign currency component (from 27.02% to 18.85%).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -222 bp for mortgages, -221 bp for consumer loans, and -185 bp for building loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower rate of inflation.",
        "There have been reductions during this same period of: -171 bp for mortgages, -167 bp for consumer loans, and -136 bp for construction loans.The levels of the real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit, and loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign ContextIn the last few months, economic activity in the developed economies has continued to recover.",
        "In the emerging economies, in turn, growth rates have stabilized but, in some cases, at levels below their potential.In the United States, the information from the third quarter shows that economic growth surged and was better than expected.",
        "In spite of that, the data show a slowdown in consumption and exports.",
        "The higher growth was mainly due to the increase in inventory which could affect growth in the last quarter of the year.",
        "The figures for the fourth quarter show that productive activity has continued to expand.",
        "Thus the main impact of the federal government shutdown in October was on consumer confidence and not on private activity as industry and the indicators of business opinion continued to rise.In the euro zone, growth remained in positive territory during the third quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, the expansion was lower that what had been seen in the second.",
        "In both Germany and France growth rates that were lower than in the previous quarter were seen (in the case of France, there was a contraction).",
        "There are some symptoms of a recovery in some of the economies on the periphery although it is still at a very slow pace.",
        "In addition, the confidence indicators for both businesses and consumers as well as the business opinion indicators have continued to recover in the last few months.",
        "In spite of that, the economy remains vulnerable in terms of financial stability and economic activity.In the emerging economies, growth was positive in the third quarter although lower than what has been seen in previous years.",
        "The growth in China was in line with what was expected and the preliminary figures for the fourth quarter show some stability.",
        "Growth in other Asian economies is remaining lower than what was seen in previous years.In Latin America, in turn, there was a slight slowdown in the rate of growth in Peru while some stability can be seen in the growth rate for Chile.",
        "In both cases, the latest data shows levels that are lower than what their potential is estimated to be.",
        "A slowdown has been seen in Venezuela.Regarding the international prices for petroleum, the lower geopolitical tensions and the lower expected growth in the emerging economies have allowed its price to decline since August.",
        "However, in the last few days there has been a slight uptick due to some law and order problems in Lybia.",
        "In the case of other goods exported by Colombia such as coal and nickel, the prices have remained relatively stable in the last few weeks.",
        "The prices of food, in turn, are staying below the levels seen in 2012 and, in some cases, they have decreased further in the last few weeks.Due to all of the above, inflation in the main developed economies and in a considerable group of emerging ones has dropped in the last few months.",
        "This situation together with growth that is lower than the potential has given an incentive to several central banks to reduce their benchmark interest rates.",
        "The central banks of other economies that have higher inflationary pressures such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia have raised their rates in the last few months.The country’s terms of trade remain high but lower than those for previous years.",
        "Going forward, no rise in these terms is expected in a scenario of dilatory recovery of the global economy and better conditions expected in the global supply of petroleum.With respect to the monetary policy announcements on the part of the Federal Reserve of the United States, it appears that the markets have discounted the fact that the termination of the stimulus program will be delayed more than was anticipated a few months ago.",
        "This has generated a degree of calm in the financial markets, which has been reflected in stability in the risk perception of the emerging economies.",
        "Some reactivation of capital flows has also been seen and this has contributed to reducing exchange rate pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, the uncertainty with respect to the beginning and speed of normalizing monetary policy in the United States as well as the effect that it could have on the financial markets remains high  AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) The results of worldwide growth for the third quarter show a foreign global demand that is recovering slowly mainly fueled by the developed countries.",
        "Both the growth in the United States and the recovery of economic activity in the euro zone turned out to be somewhat better than projected.",
        "The growth of the large emerging economies in Asia and Latin America was heterogenous and the rates of growth in the majority were lower than their potential.",
        "(ii) The interest rates for American Treasury bonds have been relatively stable but at levels that are higher than the ones seen before May, the month when a possible reduction in the monetary stimulus on the part of the Fed was announced.",
        "Nevertheless, the uncertainty with respect to the beginning and speed of normalizing monetary policy in the United States is high.",
        "(iii) The country’s terms of trade remain high but lower than those for previous years.",
        "Going forward, no rise in these terms is expected in a scenario of dilatory recovery of the global economy and better conditions expected in the global supply of petroleum.",
        "(iv) In September, industrial production excluding coffee bean threshing showed a drop in annual terms again.",
        "The annual growth of retail sales was low although it registered a rate increase for the third quarter similar to the one seen in the second.",
        "(v) The figures for October show a recovery in household confidence, an improvement in the sales performance of durable goods, and an improvement in the businessmen’s perception of sales.",
        "The growth of the industrial demand for energy rose and the surveys suggest a recovery in shipping and in the production expectations of the manufacturing sector for the coming three months.",
        "(vi) Due to the above, the technical team not modify their growth estimate for the third quarter (between 3.8% and 5.4%) nor for all of 2013 (between 3.5% and 4.5%).",
        "(vii) In October, the total growth of bank loans slowed down although it continued to be higher than the rise in the nominal GDP.",
        "The majority of the nominal interest rates for loans declined during the month.",
        "In real terms, they remained below their historical averages (except for the rates for credit cards) and drove economic growth.",
        "(viii) Annual consumer inflation showed an unexpected, sharp drop as it went from 2.27% in September to 1.84% in October.",
        "This was mainly due to a transitory fall in the growth rate of food prices.",
        "(ix) The economic analysts’ inflation expectations for a year from now as well as those derived from the public debt papers with maturities of less than five years declined and were below 3%.",
        "To the degree in which supply shocks are diluted and the aggregate demand continues to be driven by an expansionary monetary policy, expectations are expected to converge on the long term target.To summarize, economic growth in 2013 is expected to be similar to what was seen the year before.",
        "To the degree in which the supply shock for food dilutes, inflation and expectations for it should return to the target range and pick up their convergence again towards the long term target (3%).",
        "Interest rates are staying at levels that stimulate the economy’s aggregate expenditures.The members of the Board agreed that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged.",
        "Some emphasized the fact that the information available as of the previous Board meeting had shown mixed signals with variables that performed better than expected and others that were below the expectations.",
        "They also thought that if the information available in the future suggests a consolidation of expectations of a downturn in inflation with a growth that is equally or less than expected, there would be room for a monetary boost that is greater than the current one.",
        "It will also be necessary to keep in mind the possible effects of a reduction in the purchase of assets on the part of the FED (“tapering”) on the country’s financial variables.Other members also added that it is necessary to have a symmetrical response with respect to deviations from the forecast inflation compared to the target.",
        "This means that it is just as undesirable to go above the ceiling of the target range as it is to go below the range.",
        "Finally, the need to evaluate the signs that the potential GDP may be higher than what has been estimated as well as the permanence of this phenomenon and the effects that may occur in the policy realm was discussed.",
        "Due to that, it may be necessary to make adjustments in order to sped up the convergence of inflation with the goal and the closing the output gap    DECISIONThe Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board confirmed their commitment to the long term inflation rate of 3% and reiterated that the actions taken by monetary policy will continue to be directed towards making inflation converge with said value.",
        "Thus, an inflation target of 3% was legally defined for 2014 with a range of +/- 1 pp.",
        "Low and stable inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable growth of output and employment.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on March 22, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and full-time co-directors Messrs.  Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached BACKGROUNDa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationIn February the annual CPI inflation was 1.83%, 16 basis points (bp) less than the month before.",
        "As has been the case for several months, the minor adjustments in food prices are largely responsible for this result.",
        "However, the rest of the sub-baskets (regulated, tradables, and non-tradables) showed greater stability this month in comparison to what was seen in previous months.The decline in the annual change in the CPI for food – from 1.7% in January to 1.2% in February – again covered a substantial number of products including perishables (from -5.0% in January to -5.6% in February), processed (from 2.2% in January to 1.6% in February), and eating away from home (from 3.9% in January to 3.6% in February).",
        "The different factors that could be the explanation for this performance in February and in previous months are: the few increases in international prices for imported food, the very limited exchange rate pressure, the low cost pressure (partly due to the reductions in tariffs associated with the trade agreements that have gone into effect), and climatic conditions that are favorable to the supply.",
        "It is also possible that the reduction in the IVA for eating away from home and some perishable food items since the beginning of the year is still in the process of being transmitted to prices in February.",
        "Furthermore, last month the lower demand form Venezuela would have begun to play a significant role and this could be translating into an upswing in the agricultural supply of products such as meat, eggs, and chicken that is available for domestic consumption.",
        "The adjustments in the prices for these products were low or even negative last month.Within the CPI excluding food, there were no significant changes in the annual variations for regulated prices and tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "In the first case, the annual change in February remained at 0.7%.",
        "Even though there were increases in the fees for natural gas service, electricity, and fuel, these were offset by nullifying adjustments in the fees for water and sewer service and by a significant reduction in the ticket prices for intermunicipal buses.",
        "It is noteworthy that the annual change in the CPI for regulated prices showed significant drops in the second half of 2012 and in January of this year.For tradables excluding food and regulated prices, the annual change in February was low (0.7%) and similar to what was registered in January.",
        "In this sub-basket, reductions or rare rises in the prices of imported goods such as cars, electrical appliances, electronic and communication devices, as well as airline tickets, etc.",
        "continued to be seen.",
        "The accumulated appreciation from previous months and the low pressure from international prices are the explanation for this situation.Finally, the annual change in the CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices declined a little in February to 3.84% with respect to the 3.94% in January although it is still the sub-basket with the highest adjustments.",
        "A substantial part of the reduction was accounted for by the segment of entertainment, cultural and leisure activities.",
        "Other components that showed minor adjustments were enrollment fees, pensions and some health services.",
        "The annual change for rent, an item that has been highly indexed, remained at 3.8% and the declining trend it has been on for the last three months was broken.In February, there was another decline in the indicators of core inflation but one that was less than what had been seen in the previous three months.",
        "The average for the four indicators that are monitored by the Banco de la República was 2.49% compared to 2.59% in January.The annual change in the PPI remained in negative territory at -2.47% in February, which is 4 bp more that what was registered in January.",
        "This, as in previous months, is due to the accumulated appreciation and stability of international prices for the majority of raw materials and other goods.nflation expectations for December 2013, which were gathered from market analysts through the Bank’s monthly survey, declined in February although less than they had in previous months.",
        "At the beginning of March, this percentage was 2.55% compared to 2.65% in February.",
        "In spite of the above, expectations during both months for twelve months from now remained at close to 2.9%.",
        "In the case of the expectations that are estimated on the basis of the TES rate, no declines were seen there either in the four weeks prior to the closing date of March 14.",
        "The inflation expected for two, three, and five years from now was close to 2.6% which is slightly above the datum from the month before GrowthThe latest information published by DANE shows a sharp revision in several of the components of the GDP for 2011 and 2012, especially investment in public works.",
        "With this, DANE corrected the figures for GDP growth in 2011 from 5.9% to 6.6%.When the revisions are incorporated, the rates of annual expansion for the first three quarters of 2012 were 5.3%, 5.0%, and 2.7% respectively.",
        "The datum for the fourth quarter was 3.1% and that for the full year was 4.0%.",
        "Domestic demand grew 4.6% in 2012 which represents a slowdown in comparison to what was registered in 2011 (8.2%).",
        "The slowdown was mainly seen in the second half of the year.Household consumption played an important role and actively contributed to the expansion of domestic demand.",
        "In the fourth quarter, private consumption grew 4.0%.",
        "However, this part of the GDP also showed a loss of strength in its annual rate of growth as it went from 5.9% in 2011 to 4.3% in 2012.",
        "Breaking it down by component, the most serious slowdowns were registered in expenditures allocated to the purchase of durable and semidurable goods.",
        "Services and the purchase of non-durable goods, in turn, also slowed down but to a lesser degree.",
        "With regards to government consumption, the annual expansion was 6.5% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the entire year.With respect to fixed gross capital formation, this expenditure grew 6.0% in 2012 which is also lower than the growth in 2011 (18.7%).",
        "The component that contributed the most to the growth of expenditure on capital goods was what was allocated to investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "This grew 7.7% for the year as a whole.",
        "In the second half of 2012, all of the items that this aggregate is made up of showed a generalized slowdown, which complicates the interpretation of the shocks that this aggregate suffered in the second half of the year.In 2012, significantly lower growth rates were registered for imports and exports.",
        "With respect to the first aggregate, its expansion was 8.0% last year, which is much lower than what was registered in 2011 when it grew 21.2%.",
        "Foreign sales also showed less strength as they grew 5.3% compared to 12.9% in 2011.",
        "In the fourth quarter, annual growth on the order of 3.3% and 1.4% respectively for the two areas was registered.Regarding supply, the mining (5.9% annually), financial (5.5 annually), and community, social and personal services (4.9% annually) sectors are among the sectors that grew more than the overall economy in 2012.",
        "In the case of the mining sector, a sharp slowdown in comparison to 2011 (14.4% annually) was seen.",
        "It was concentrated in the second half of the year and was due to the contraction in the production of coal and the slower rate of growth in petroleum production.",
        "In the financial sector, in spite of the slowdown in loans in the second half of the year, significant growth was reported that contributed positively to the total expansion of the economy given its large share of the GDP (19.6%).",
        "Last of all, in the area of services, the performance of the community services provided by the government stands out.",
        "With respect to the economic situation for the first quarter of 2013, the information available points to the growth of the economy being lower than what was seen at the end of 2012.",
        "This trend suggests a current economic growth that is below its potential.In the area of expenditures, household consumption could show a slowdown at the beginning of the year as the latest information from survey of consumer confidence measured by Fedesarrollo suggests.",
        "In February, this indicator fell significantly and went to levels that were slightly below their historical average.",
        "Added to that, there was a slump in car sales on the order of 16.4% in February according to the Colombian Automobile Committee and the figures published by Econometria.",
        "The monthly survey of economic expectations done by the Banco de la Republica, in turn, suggests that the sales in January were significantly lower than those registered in the fourth quarter of 2012.",
        "Nevertheless, it should be noted that the figures in dollars for imports of consumer goods showed an annual growth of 19.9% in January.Total exports, in contrast saw a change of -1.1% in January in comparison to the same month in 2012.",
        "This drop was due to the combined reduction of exports of mining (-2.2%) and agricultural (-15.3%) products.",
        "Exports of industrial products (along with others) registered an annual growth of 10.2%, an upsurge with respect to what was registered in December.",
        "This better performance was primarily due to the rise in sales of vehicles (109.5%), chemical products (13%), and rubber and plastics (43.7%).In the area of supply, the variables associated with industry continue to show poor performance.",
        "In January, the order, inventory, and production expectation indicators continued to hold to the negative trend of previous months.",
        "Furthermore, the unregulated electricity demand fell 2.1% annually for industry in February after having grown a little more than 2% in January.",
        "This indicator, which is highly correlated with the growth of industry, suggests an additional deterioration in the sector for that month.",
        "The fact that part of this fall was because of one less working day in February this year (the year before was a leap year) should be kept in mind.With regards to the area of mining, production of coal was affected in February and March by labor strikes in Cerrejon and the environmental problem Drummond had which caused a stop in production due to the restrictions on transportation of the product to the port (temporary suspension of the freight license).",
        "In the agricultural area, the fact that coffee production grew 36.7% annually on average between January and February should be emphasized.Moreover, in addition to the unexpected shocks in the mining sector, there were fewer working days in the first quarter of the year (Easter week and one working day less in February) which have a negative impact, especially on the industrial sector.The numbers from the labor market show that the unemployment rate continued to fall at the beginning of the year.",
        "Furthermore, as of January, the growth in the level of employment showed something of an upswing and the indicators of employment quality continued growing at significant rates.",
        "Wage-earning employment, in particular, surged substantially Financial VariablesThe growth of bank loans (/ and F/C) has stabilized in the last five months at an annual rate of growth of close to 15%.",
        "The slowdown in the loan portfolio denominated in local currency has been offset by a boost in the loan portfolio denominated in foreign currency.",
        "Between October 2012 and February 2013, the rate of growth for the former slipped from 15.8% to 14.4% while the latter went from 6.0% to 24.8%.Going by types of loans, the annual growth of the commercial loan portfolio went from 13.2% in October 2012 to 14.2% in February 2013.",
        "Loans allocated to households, in turn, saw a slight slowdown in February with 16.9% compared to the 18.6% seen in October 2012.",
        "The mortgage portfolio also saw a slowdown in the annual change during the same period (from 15.5% to 14.5%).The nominal interest rates for all of the different types of loans granted marked a declining trend in comparison to their levels during the last part of July when the policy interest rate began to go down.",
        "However, in real terms, the decline in inflation and inflation expectations has neutralized a large part of that trend.The real interest rate in February for disbursements allocated to consumption was 16.0%.",
        "Those for mortgages was 10.2%, for preferential loans, it was 5.9%, for regular commercial loans, 9.0%, all of which rates are below their respective historical averages calculated since 2000.",
        "However, the real interest rates for credit card loans and for the treasury loans were at 27.1% and 5.8% respectively.",
        "These are above their averages calculated since 2000 The External ContextThe new information suggests that the average economic growth our trading partners will have in 2013 could be somewhat less than what had been estimated in past reports and lower than what was registered in 2012.",
        "Furthermore, the uncertainty and risk perception in the financial market which had declined in the last few months could rise again due to the events in Europe last month.In the euro zone, the recovery of productive activity has not materialized yet and everything indicates that the GDP for the region has continued shrinking in the first quarter of the year.",
        "In spite of that, the rate of deterioration in productive activity seems to be moderating since some indicators such as industrial activity and the opinion indices in the manufacturing and services sectors have paused in their downward trend.",
        "In addition, there has been a slight recovery in consumer and business confidence in the last few months.",
        "The most favorable news comes from Germany.",
        "In this country, a reactivation of productive activity was seen in the first few months of the year due to the exports to countries outside of the region and to the strength of domestic consumption.",
        "In this context, economic activity is expected begin to recover in the region by the second half of the year.",
        "However, the political climate and the decisions made by the European economic authorities could affect confidence in the region again as has occurred recently since the inconclusive elections in Italy and the conditions for rescuing the banking sector in Cyprus.In the United States, the figures for the productive activity in the first few months of the year are relatively favorable and suggest that the economy has continued to expand.",
        "The real estate sector and labor market are still recovering slowly.",
        "However, since there was no agreement with respect to the budgetary cuts in health and education, the fiscal adjustment in the United States could be greater than expected.",
        "That could have a negative effect on the outlook for growth for this country in 2013.",
        "The drop in consumer confidence that was seen in the first weeks of March could already be reflecting this.In China, although the indicators for January and February are not easy to interpret given the effects of the new year, it can be said that growth not slow down during those months.",
        "Therefore, productive activity would have continued to expand at a favorable rate.In the larger economies in Latin America, growth for 2012 was good with the exception of Brazil.",
        "Some economic indicators for the first quarter of the year show a favorable performance in Chile and Peru and to a lesser degree in Mexico.",
        "A recovery has been seen in Brazil but it is still at low levels.",
        "Low growth is estimated for Venezuela in 2013.Regarding the international prices for petroleum, the upswings seen in February have reversed.",
        "The weakness of global demand and some favorable data on the supply of petroleum and its substitutes could explain the lower prices in the last few weeks.",
        "Other prices for goods exported by Colombia such as coal, nickel, and coffee have remained relatively stable at levels below those seen last year.In the case of prices for food, although there have been some rises in soybeans, corn and palm oil, these still do not represent an inflationary risk and are not expected to continue given the expectations for a good worldwide supply.That being the case, inflation in the main developed economies and in some of the emerging ones (mainly Latin American) is remaining at relatively low levels.",
        "This fact, together with the weak economic growth, has made it possible for the central banks in developed countries to maintain an expansionary monetary policy.",
        "In addition, it has allowed several central banks in emerging countries to reduce their policy rates recently.In this context, if the risk premiums Colombia remains at the current levels, the cost of external financing for the country will continue to stay low.In summary, the new information suggests that the average economic growth that our trading partners will have in 2013 could be somewhat lower than what had been estimated in past reports and below what was registered for 2012.",
        "If these predictions materialize, the contribution that foreign demand would make to Colombia’s growth will remain low.",
        "Likewise, if the trend that has been seen in prices for the main export products continues, the average terms of trade in 2013 will be lower than those seen last year AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects under consideration:(i) The growth of our trading partners will probably be lower than expected and, as a result, the contribution of foreign demand to the growth of the country will remain low.",
        "Likewise, if the trends that were seen in the prices for our main export products should continue, the average terms of trade in 2013 will be lower than those from last year.",
        "As a consequence, the aggregate expenditure in 2013 will not have an additional boost from a larger national income.",
        "(ii) The new data on economic growth for 2012 (4%) show a slowdown from the high levels in 2011 (6.6%).",
        "The largest loss of strength occurred in the second half of the year and was mainly due to a significant reduction in the growth of investment.",
        "The growth of private consumption moderated in 2012 and came to rates that were similar to their historical average.",
        "The growth of exports also registered a decline in comparison to 2011 with a significant fall in the fourth quarter.",
        "(iii) Interpretation of the shocks that investment suffered in the second half of 2012 is complex and could be due to multiple factors as can be seen from the fact that all of the components of this aggregate showed a slowdown in the second half of the year.",
        "(iv) In the first quarter of 2013, the deterioration in trade expectations as well as the fall in the consumer confidence index and sales of automobiles suggest a lower performance in private consumption.",
        "In January, the value of the exports in dollars was similar to what was registered a year before and industrial exports registered a positive annual growth.",
        "Nevertheless, the indicators of business confidence indicate that industrial activity will continue to shrink.",
        "This performance suggests that the current economic growth is below its potential and, therefore, the constraints on the use of the productive capacity are increasing.",
        "(v) The drop in annual inflation from 2.0% in January to 1.8% in February was similar to what was predicted by the technical team.",
        "This slowdown was mainly due to the lower rate of increase in food prices, mainly processed ones.",
        "All of the measurements of core inflation also declined.",
        "Both the average of those measurements and inflation expectations are below the target (3%).",
        "The recent reduction in the international prices for energy and other commodities imply lower pressure on local inflation.",
        "(vi) The reductions in the Banco de la Republica’s interest rates have been transmitted to the interest rates for deposits and loans in the financial system.",
        "However, the real interest rates have not fallen to the same degree due to the sharp drop in inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "(vii) The growth of the loan portfolio is becoming more moderate.",
        "So far this year, there has been a slowdown in commercial loans denominated in pesos but a rise in financing through the issuance of bonds by firms together with greater foreign indebtedness.",
        "Loans to households (consumer loans and mortgages) continues to grow more slowly but at rates that are higher than the rise in the nominal GDP.",
        "The continuing moderation in the rate at which firms and households are using leverage is reducing the risk of generating financial excesses during the current expansionary phase of monetary policy.In this context, an evaluation of the balance of risks indicates the usefulness of reducing the benchmark interest rate 50 bp.",
        "With this, the macroeconomic policy is expected to be consistent with a growth of the economy that is close to its potential DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the current balance of risks, the Board of Directors agreed unanimously to reduce the benchmark interest rate 50 basis points.",
        "The decision was based on the fact that the Colombian economy is growing at a rate that is below its potential and will probably be operating at below its productive capacity over the next few quarters.",
        "In addition, the inflation that has been seen and is being projected is below the target of 3%.",
        "This is in a context in which the reductions in interest rates are seemingly being transmitted into the economy more slowly than desired.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on October 25, 2013.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2)     AND GROWTHa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationIn September, annual consumer inflation was 2.27%, which is the same as what was registered the month before.",
        "In the first nine months of the year, the accumulated change in the CPI came to 2.16%, which is lower than the accumulated change for the same period in 2012 (2.32%).",
        "The stability of the indicator for the latest month was the result of a surge in the annual variation of the CPI for food that was offset by reductions in the annual changes of the CPI for the other three large components (regulated and tradables and non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices).The annual variation of the CPI for food in September was 2.1%, 28 basis points (bp) higher with respect to August.",
        "The rising trend in this indicator has been continuous since the middle of the second quarter.",
        "The prices for perishables are the reason for a large part of this performance (they rose 40 bp in comparison to the month before and were at 5.9%).",
        "There was very moderate upward pressure on processed foods (0.18% annual change).",
        "In this sub-basket, the depreciation of the last few months has not been transmitted to the domestic prices which could be due to the fact that the international prices for grain, oleaginous products, and oil have fallen significantly.",
        "Finally, the annual change in the CPI for eating away from home rose to 3.7% from 3.6% in August.The annual change in the CPI excluding food was at 2.4% this month, 10 bp less than the information from August.",
        "After the increases seen between January and June, this variable has shown a slightly downward trend.",
        "The largest drop occurred in the annual change in the CPI for regulated prices (1.2% in September compared to 1.5% in August) and is mainly due to the stability of the fuel prices in comparison to the upswings registered during the same month last year.",
        "The annual change in the CPI for regulated items has remained below annual inflation since -2012 thanks to the lower increases in the international prices for petroleum, the reductions in the fees for sewage and garbage collection services, and other decreases associated with the tax reforms at the beginning of this year.In the case of the CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items, the annual change was 3.7% or 8 bp less than what was seen in August.",
        "This indicator shows, with a few interruptions, a slight downward trend which has been ongoing for three quarters and which the performance of rentals, its most important component, has made possible.",
        "The annual variation for rent was at 3.6% last month compared to 3.7% in August and lower than those registered in June and March.",
        "In the rest of the subgroups for the non-tradables basket, there were adjustments of close to 3.0% except for education which was at 4.9%.With respect to tradables excluding food and regulated items, the datum for September was 1.3%, 5 bp below that registered for August.",
        "Although the depreciation from previous months has been transmitted to said prices, this has occurred slowly and intermittently.The average for the four core inflation indicators that are monitored by the Banco de la Republica was at 2.51% in September, 3 bp less than the month before.",
        "This indicator has stabilized around 2.5% since February of this year.The annual variation of the PPI declined to -1.3% in September from -0.5% in August.",
        "The local component decreased with respect to the month before (122 bp), due to the lower adjustments to the prices for agricultural and manufactured products.",
        "The import component rose 1.6% annually in September as a result of the recent depreciation of the peso.Regarding inflation expectations, according to the Bank’s monthly survey of financial market analysts, expected inflation for December of this year is 2.6% while that for the coming 12 months is 3.0%.",
        "These are the same as those registered last month.",
        "The inflation expectations derived from the yield curve of the TES at horizons of 2, 3, and 5 years, in turn, are between 2.6% and 2.7%.",
        "This represented a slight rise from what was seen a month ago    GrowthThe indicators of demand that are available for the third quarter suggest a greater expansion of the GDP than what was registered in the first half of the year.",
        "This surge is largely the result of the performance of domestic demand, a category that could have been driven mainly by the positive performance of investment.",
        "Household consumption would have grown at a rate similar to what was seen in the first half of the year.The expected surge in investment during the third quarter would have been mainly due to the favorable performance that is expected for building construction.",
        "The greater expected expansion in this item is associated to a large degree with the low base of comparison from the same period last year and the effect of the government’s policy on priority housing and the generally positive outlook for the housing market which was reflected in the increase in the number of building licenses approved during the third quarter.",
        "The investment in public works is expected to grow at rates that are slightly higher than those registered in the second quarter.",
        "Note that the uncertainty surrounding the performance of investment in public works projects is very high.Investments other than building construction and public works are expected to have a slightly better performance than what was registered in the second quarter.",
        "This is based on the balance of the investment expectations reported by businessmen in the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) and the results (in terms of real pesos) of imports of capital goods and machinery for industry.In the third quarter, the performance of household consumption is expected to be similar to what was seen in the first half of the year.",
        "According to the information from the monthly retail-trade surveys ( in Spanish) published by DANE, retail sales grew 6.9% in annual terms during August.",
        "This figure is higher than the 5.8% registered for the second quarter and the 2.8% for the first half of the year.",
        "When the segment of vehicle sales was discounted, they grew 8.6% annually in the same period.",
        "This shows an upsurge in comparison to 5.2% for the second quarter and 4.3% for the first semester.",
        "The growth rates for the July-August 2-month period confirmed the outlook of a positive performance for private consumption in the third quarter (6.2% in the growth of total sales, 5.9% when vehicles are discounted).",
        "In line with the above, the EMEE balance of sales suggests that, in July and August, merchants saw a slightly stronger demand than what had been seen in the second quarter.Nevertheless, there are indications that the strength of consumption in the third quarter could be lower than what has been drawn from the previously described indicators.",
        "On the one hand, the Fedesarrollo consumer confidence index for September was at levels similar to those registered in August, which had fallen significantly with respect to what had been seen in the second quarter of the year.",
        "On the other, the consumer loan portfolio registered new slowdowns (in real terms) when it expanded 10.0% in annual terms during the July-September quarter in comparison to 11.7% for the second quarter and 12.9% for the first half of the year.With respect to the country’s foreign sales, the total value exported in dollars in August presented an annual increase of 8.9%.",
        "This increase is the result of the 19.3% growth in the exports of mining products (the higher foreign sales of petroleum and its derivatives and coal).",
        "This month, agricultural exports registered a dip of 0.8% associated with the negative change in exports of bananas and coffee.",
        "The exports of industrial goods and others fell 16.4% primarily because of the lower sales of chemical products, other agricultural products, rubber, plastics, and vehicles.",
        "For the third quarter, exports are expected to have grown at a modest rate mainly due to the effect that the various strikes that occurred in the coal sector could have had.In the month of August, total imports in dollars dropped 5% with respect to the same month last year.",
        "This performance was due to the combined fall in the imports of capital goods (-6.1%), raw materials (-3.9%), and consumer goods (-5.4%).",
        "The prediction is that this sector will grow at a higher rate than exports in the third quarter although below the rate registered in 2012.With respect to supply, the indicators available suggest that the construction sector will have been the main source of output growth followed by agriculture, mining, and commerce.",
        "The performance of industry will continue to be low.The GDP for industry will have shown no or slightly positive annual growth in the third quarter.",
        "Even if an additional drop can be expected in the industrial production index excluding coffee threshing, the performance of the coffee sector will have offset falls in some branches of industry since the threshing will have been growing well above the average for the entire economy.",
        "This was the case when the industrial production index excluding coffee threshing fell 3.9% annually in August (in July, it had grown 0.2%) while there was significant growth in coffee threshing (it rose 12.7% annually in August and 15.1% in July).",
        "Although other industry indicators showed slight deteriorations with respect to the previous month, when an analysis of the trends is done, one sees that its long term components could be stabilizing.",
        "This is the case for the orders indicator, the inventory indicator, and the industrial outlook for six months from the Fedesarrollo survey.In regards to mining, in spite of the drop that could be seen in the production of coal due to the strike at the Drummond, better growth is expected for this quarter because of the increase that has been seen in petroleum production.",
        "In this latter sector, the annual growth for the July-September quarter was 8.7%.In the construction sector, the available indicators suggest that the positive performance seen in the first half of the year will continue over the coming three months.",
        "Construction licenses grew 18.7% in August primarily due to a 33.1% upswing in the area approved for housing.With respect to other sectors, the lower performance of the transportation sector together with the strike in August could have had negative effects.",
        "Nonetheless, it is expected that the growth rate for the third quarter will be maintained at a level that is only slightly lower than that for the second.",
        "In the case of commerce, the information from Fedesarrollo and Fenalco shows a weakening in the outlook the merchants have of the future.",
        "However, as was mentioned above, retail sales showed a strong performance in August.",
        "Last of all, agriculture will have had a favorable performance mainly supported by the strength of coffee production.",
        "According to the Federation of Coffee Growers, this is growing at more than 40% in the third quarter.All of the above makes it possible to predict that the growth of the Colombian economy will have been between 3.8% and 5.2% in the third quarter of 2013.",
        "Note that the width of this range is determined to a large degree by the uncertainty surrounding the performance of the investment in public works and public consumption.The forecast range for all of 2013 is between 3.5% and 4.5%.",
        "This forecast assumes that household consumption in the second half of the year will grow at rates close to those seen in the first half of the year while investment in construction will surge significantly.",
        "By branches of activity, the strongest sectors will be construction and agriculture while the lowest performance will be seen in industry.The estimated growth of the Colombian economy in 2014 will be between 3.0% and 5.0%    Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) in September registered an annual growth rate of 13.94% which is close to the average seen since April (13.97%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency climbed from 12.90% in August to 13.18% in September and that in foreign currency went from 30.91% to 27.25% during the same period.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households registered an annual growth in September of 12.80%, which is lower than the growth in the previous month (13.19%).",
        "This was the result of the performance of consumer loans which went from 12.90% to 12.37% while mortgages maintained an annual growth of 14.0% in September.The growth rate of the commercial loan portfolio rose 36 bp in September (14.41%) with respect to the same month last year due to the upswing in the national currency component (from 12.33% in August to 13.13% in September).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -223 bp for mortgages, -206 bp for consumer loans, and -185 bp for building loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower rate of inflation.",
        "There have been reductions during the same period of: -189 bp in mortgages, -170 bp in consumer loans, and -141 bp in loans for construction.The levels of the real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit, and loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average    The External EnvironmentThe information available for the third quarter indicates that the world economy has continued to recover.",
        "This is due to the positive growth indicators that are beginning to be registered in the euro zone after a prolonged period of contraction as well as moderate growth in the United States and Japan.",
        "The large emerging economies in Asia and Latin America, in turn, are growing heterogeneously although the majority are showing rates of expansion that are lower than those seen the year before.In the case of the euro zone, the business and consumer confidence indicators together with the activity indicators in the manufacturing and service sectors continued to show an encouraging performance based on data as of September.",
        "Likewise, based on the figures as of August, retail sales completed several months of monthly growth and are slowing down their annual decline.",
        "Nevertheless, it is important to note that the economy of this region remains vulnerable.",
        "The unemployment rate, especially in the economies on the periphery, is still at high levels.",
        "Credit continues to contract and financial fragmentation is still affecting the most vulnerable economies in the region.In the case of Japan, the strong stimulus provided by the monetary policy is beginning to manifest itself in the positive indicators of economic activity in that country.",
        "These show that exports have continued to expand just as industrial activity has.",
        "In this context, business confidence has risen in the last few months in contrast to consumer confidence which has been deteriorating for several months.With respect to the United States, retail sales and industry grew in both monthly and annual terms based on the figures for August.",
        "Likewise, in September, the activity indicators in the manufacturing and service sectors remained in expansionary territory.",
        "This information indicates that productive activity expanded at a moderate rate in the third quarter.",
        "Note that in the first few days of October, the US Congress not succeed in reaching an agreement on the budget for the fiscal year as a result of which, a government shutdown was declared.",
        "The discussions about the budget coincided with the negotiations on the debt limit.",
        "On October 16, Congress reached an agreement that prevented a suspension of economy payments (the debt was approved until February 2014) and allowed the government to reopen until January 2014.",
        "During this period, negotiations should be carried out to agree on new fiscal adjustments.In the emerging economies, the economic growth of China rose slightly in the third quarter of the year.",
        "The better growth was reflected in the recovery of domestic demand and industrial activity.",
        "During this period, the government implemented some stimulus measures that contributed to the growth of investment.In the case of Latin America, based on preliminary information for the third quarter, the performance of productive activity continues to be heterogenous.",
        "Thus, while in Peru the monthly indicators show a limited upswing, the growth in Chile seems to be stabilizing at 4.5%, a rate that is below its potential.",
        "The economy in Brazil, in turn, seems to be losing strength.Regarding the international prices of commodities, the increase in geopolitical tensions raised the foreign prices of petroleum above what had been estimated by the technical team in the June Inflation Report in the third quarter.",
        "For other goods exported by Colombia, the falling prices for coal and nickel were interrupted and, in the last few weeks, they have shown some stability.",
        "However, the foreign prices for coffee continued to fall though at a slower rate.",
        "There were also drops in the international prices of some beans and grains (except for wheat).Inflation in the main developed economies has stayed relatively stable in the last few months.",
        "The panorama is more heterogenous for inflation in the emerging economies.",
        "Thus, there are countries such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia with relatively high inflation and in some cases, inflation that is above the targets fixed by their central banks.",
        "In contrast, there are economies like Chile, Colombia, and Peru with inflation that is low but rising.",
        "Other Asian economies show low and even declining inflation (Taiwan and Korea).In regards to global financial markets, the latest events in the United States have led to the market reducing the probability that the FED will begin to lower the amount of monthly asset purchases this year.",
        "This has partially reversed the increases in the long term interest rates that were registered as of May.",
        "It also produced a decline in the country risk indicators in Latin America and a slight appreciation of their currencies.Taking this international environment into account, the technical team continues to predict a growth in the foreign demand for Colombian products for this year that is below what was seen the year before.",
        "It is to be hoped that for the rest of the year and in the coming one, the terms of trade remain at relatively high levels even if they are lower than those registered at the beginning of 2012.The external risks for global economic activity rose with respect to the previous quarterly report.",
        "On one hand, the uncertainty about the fiscal agreements in the United States could have a negative effect on consumer and financial market confidence and this would have an impact on the economic growth of this country both in 2013 and 2014.",
        "On the other hand, the changes in financial flows that would result from the beginning of a phase out of the monetary stimulus in the United States could cause a sharper slowdown in 2014, even including risks to financial stability, in the most vulnerable emerging economies AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors considered the following relative aspects.",
        "(i) The global economy is expanding at a moderate rate and its short term strength has changed a little with respect to what has been seen in previous quarters.",
        "According to indicators for the third quarter, there is an incipient recovery in the euro zone.",
        "However, the growth of the United States could have been weakened as a consequence of the partial shutdown of the federal government and the greater uncertainty.",
        "The emerging economies as a whole are expanding at a slower pace although the growth of the GDP in China was higher than the market expected.",
        "(ii) Furthermore, the probability that the FED will begin to reduce the amount of monthly asset purchases this year has dropped.",
        "This is what partially reversed the increases in the long term interest rates that were registered as of May.",
        "It also produced a decline in the country risk indicators in Latin America and a slight appreciation of their currencies(iii) The international price of petroleum and of some raw materials imported by Colombia, in turn, dropped.",
        "(iv) In Colombia, the data available for the third quarter suggest that, driven by investment, economic activity is expanding at a faster rate than it in the first half of the year.",
        "Consumption will have grown at a rate similar to that of the first half of the year.",
        "In the area of supply, the construction sector will have been the main source of growth, followed by agriculture, mining and commerce.",
        "The technical team forecasts a rate of growth that is between 3.5% and 4.5% for all of 2013.",
        "(v) Bank loans are growing at stable rates that were above the nominal GDP.",
        "In real terms, the interest rates for the different types of loans are below their historical averages (except for credit card interest rates) and are driving economic growth.",
        "(vi) Annual inflation (2.27%) in September remained stable with respect to the month before and the same was true of the average of the core inflation measurements.",
        "The analysts’ inflation expectations for the coming 12 months and those calculated on the basis of public debt securities at longer horizons are consistent with the long term inflation target.Some members thought that the GDP gap was slightly negative and judging by the performance of the core inflation indicators and the prices for non-tradables, it seems to have been at a stable level for quite a few months.",
        "Additionally, the 3.25% benchmark interest rate is below any reasonable estimate of the “natural” level of the nominal interest rate.",
        "This indicates an expansionary monetary posture.",
        "This posture is justified by the negative effects of external productive and financial shocks on aggregate demand and somewhat by the precarious recovery in some of the confidence and expectation indicators.",
        "There is a lot of uncertainty about the future of these variables and, therefore, maintaining the current level of the benchmark interest rate is considered appropriate.Another group of directors thought it was possible that the output gap could be more negative than previously stated if the fact that both core inflation and the -point of the inflation projections are remaining at around 2.5%, which is below the long term target, is considered.",
        "Likewise, the evolution of various sector indicators and of demand has been erratic and has not shown any convincing signs with respect to the magnitude and sustainability of the process for closing this gap.",
        "Finally, in spite of the fact that there has been some improvement in the projections for the global context, there is no indication that foreign demand could be a source for fostering better growth of output.",
        "Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to continue the stimulus that monetary policy is giving to the aggregate demand by maintaining the current expansionary posture     DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the balance of risks, the Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.Bogotá,"

    "2014": [
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on October 30, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of how Banco de la República’s technical team views the macroeconomic situation (Section 1), followed by a review of the key policy discussion points considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2).A moredetailed description of the macroeconomic situationprepared by the technical staff from the Central Bank is provided in the data section of the September 2014 edition of the Inflation Report, as well as in the statistical appendix CONTEXTRegarding the macroeconomic context, the technical staff highlights the following elements:In the present report, the growth forecast for external demand was reduced for this and the following year, as compared to the estimations from the previous quarter.",
        "The new projections suggest that in 2015 the average recovery of our commercial partners could be slower and prompted chiefly by the American economy.",
        "The euro zone could record a low growth in its GDP, but somewhat higher than what had been estimated for 2014.",
        "China could continue with their slowdown, while the majority of its partner countries in the region could recover in the following year, but would present lower growth rates than their respective potential.The risk premium measures adopted by several countries of the euro zone, as well as by some emerging economies, have increased, although moderately.",
        "The deterioration observed in the economic activity in some of these economies together with the greater uncertainty about their recovery partly explains this behavior.",
        "Additionally, the fall in the prices of the basic goods that some of these economies export, chiefly that of oil, also contributed to increase the risk measures.",
        "With this, their currencies have depreciated against the US dollar.In the United States, appreciation of the dollar and the fall in the international energy prices could contribute to reduce production costs and to reduce inflation.",
        "The unemployment rate descended again, but to levels that do not yet generate pressures of salary costs upon the prices.",
        "The lower quote for gasoline would also be an incentive for households to increase their expense.",
        "Nevertheless, the weaker rally of its commercial partners, together with the risks of a slowdown in the external demand, increased uncertainty upon the performance of its exportation sector.Facing the prospect of a lower inflation in the United States, as well as the greater risks of a slowdown in commerce worldwide, the average of the market expects that the first increase in the interest rate of the FED could take place towards the end of 2015, instead of in June next year, as had been projected a quarter ago.",
        "This more distant horizon regarding this increment contributed to the downturn in the long-term interest rates.The current levels in the international price of oil are situated way below the forecast produced by the technical staff, while those of coffee continue to be high.",
        "Other basic goods imported by Colombia such as corn, wheat, and soy, have also presented important downturns in their international quotes.",
        "In net results, the terms of trade have descended more than had been forecast, which is a situation that will be reflected on a lower national income if it continues to be sustained.The weakness in the external demand as well as lower international prices of the basic mining goods have been reflected on the behavior of the country's external sales.",
        "Until August 2014, the total exports in dollars have plummeted at a yearly rate of 2.7%.",
        "In this period, those of agricultural origin have presented high increases due to the exportations of coffee and banana, while those of mining and other sectors have descended.",
        "In the margin, for the bimester of July-August, the agricultural and other sectors presented high annual growths, while the mining sector descended, but less intensely.Until August, the imports in dollars have grown 6.8%, which is explained by the increase of those destined to raw materials, consumption, and, to a lesser extent, to capital goods.",
        "In the bimester of July-August, the external purchases addressed to consumption as well as to capital goods accelerated; those of raw materials presented a lower increase rhythm.With the aforementioned external context and the new figures of foreign trade, the technical staff increased the projection of the deficit in the current account for 2014, which could be within a range of 4.4% and 4.8% of the GDP.",
        "These figures imply a smaller current surplus of the mining sector due to the fall in the income from oil.",
        "Also, this supposes that the wide use of external savings by the remainder of sectors would have continued in the second half of the year.As for internal growth, the new indicators of supply and demand for the third quarter of 2014 suggest that the GDP will grow at a good pace in said period, although more slowly than the one registered in the first half of the year.",
        "The behavior of retail sales and consumption credit, as well as the consumer confidence index and that of the labor market, indicate that consumption would maintain a strong dynamic.",
        "The increase in the external purchases of machinery and transportation equipment, together with the trend registered by works, forecasts good performance of the investment, although at lower rates.",
        "In all, the internal demand would grow at a lower rhythm than that of the previous semester, although at a high rate, greater to that of the product.",
        "The figures of foreign trade indicate that imports would increase more than exports, and with them the balance of trade would bring a negative contribution to growth.In the third quarter, banking credit continued to slow down, recording annual rates over the nominal GDP estimated for the present year.",
        "The lowest dynamics has taken place in businesses.",
        "In the same period, the slowdown in the mortgage loans was compensated by the slight recovery of the consumption portfolio, and with it the growth of the household credit stabilized.",
        "All this takes place within a context of weak transfer of the increases in the benchmark interest rate to the interest rates of the loans.Considering the aforesaid, the technical staff from Banco de la República estimates a growth interval of economic growth for the third quarter between 4.0% and 5.2%.",
        "For all of 2014, the forecast range is between 4.5% and 5.5%, with 5.0% as the most probable figure.",
        "According to estimations, in 2015 the economy would slow down, and the GDP would present a rate of increase of around 4.3%, within an interval between 3.0% and 5.3%.The new product gap estimations for 2014 indicate that this would be slightly positive and more closed that the forecast performed in the last quarter.",
        "In 2015, the gap would continue to close, but could remain positive.Regarding inflation, the result of 2.86% at September was aligned to the expectations of the technical staff.",
        "The group of foods presented smaller rhythms of increase, and upon excluding them from the CPI, their complement also slowed down in the latest month.",
        "The other three measures of basic inflation also decreased, and the average of the four indicators was 2.63%.Along the year and until September, an inflation of 3.08% has stockpiled, a figure that already surpasses the long-term goal of 3.0%.",
        "With this result, given the low base of comparison of the CPI for the last quarter of 2013, it is probable that upon finishing the year inflation can be posting on the high part of the range established for the present year (between 2% and 4%).",
        "The analysts' inflation expectations to one year, as well as those for 2, 3, and 5 years derived from the public debt bonds, remain relatively stable and somewhat above 3%.In summary, aggregate demand continues to show a strong growth in a context close to the full use of the productive capacity.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations remain close to 3%.",
        "This takes place within an environment of deterioration of the terms of trade and a growing uncertainty regarding the recovery of the economic activity worldwide and the cost of external financing, which are factors that may impact aggregate demand and the exchange rate AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.The Board Members highlighted that the economy is showing a strong dynamic, but that there are risks of negative clashes in the traditional policy horizon which may result in a slowdown.",
        "Particularly, the external environment continues to show symptoms of weakness, and the terms of trade for Colombia have deteriorated.",
        "If this trend is maintained, the growth of national income as well as the aggregate expense will be affected.On the other hand, inflation expectations are anchored at levels close to 3.0%.",
        "The average of the indicators of basic inflation and total inflation converges towards the goal.Under these conditions, the Members of the Board agreed to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered, as well as to continue monitoring the performance of the economy DECISIONThe Board of Directors of the Central Bank unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.",
        "On March 21, 2014, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogota, In attendance were Mauricio Cardenas Santamaría, Minister of the Treasury and Public Credit, Jose Dario Uribe Escobar, the General Director, full-time Board members present: Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, Cesar Vallejo Mejia and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "A summary of the inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both drawn up by the technical team (section 1) is presented and the main discussion points and policy options considered by the Board of Directors have been summed up (section 2) AND SITUATIONa.",
        "Recent developments in inflationIn February, annual consumer inflation (2.32%) registered a surge of 19 basis points (bp) compared to what was registered in January.",
        "The surge resulted primarily from the baskets of food and regulated items.In the basket for food, the annual variation was 1.78% at the end of the month or 58 bp higher than in January.",
        "The surge occurred in the three main components of the subbasket: perishables (from 2.1% to 2.6% annually), processed foods (from -0.2% to 0.4% annually), and the meals away from home (from 3.3% to 3.9% annually).Within the CPI excluding food (2.53% annually), the main upward pressure came from the groups of regulated prices and tradables.",
        "In regulated prices (1.8% annually), a rise of 10 bp was registered in the annual change compared to the previous month which was primarily due to increases in the price for natural gas.",
        "The annual change in the CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated items (1.6% annually), in turn, rose 4 bp with respect to the previous month.",
        "The depreciation since the beginning of last year would explain the rising trend of the CPI for tradables, which had a cumulative annual variation of 90 bp in the last twelve months.",
        "The annual variation for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items remained at 3.6% with a notable rise of 10 bp in the annual change in the CPI for rent that interrupted the downward trend that has been seen for two quarters.The average of the four indicators of core inflation monitored by the Banco de la Republica was at 2.63% in February, 8 bp higher than the previous month.",
        "Thus, there have been slight rises in that variable for a full period of four consecutive months.The annual change in the PPI climbed 104 bp in February (1.3% annually).",
        "A significant portion of these rises is related to the accumulated depreciation in the exchange rate and is mostly reflected in an upswing in the imported PPI (from 2.95% to 4.28% annually).",
        "However, major growth in the PPI for locally produced and consumed goods (from -0.35% to 0.63% annually) has also been seen in the last few months.",
        "This has been concentrated in goods from the agricultural and mining sector.With respect to inflation expectations, these tended to rise in February although they remained close to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The percentage derived from the monthly survey of the expectations of financial market analysts was 2.85% and 2.90% for the end of the year and for a horizon of 12 months from now respectively.",
        "The measurements derived from the TES curve yield for 2-, 3-, and 5-year maturities remained at around 3.0% GrowthAccording to DANE, the Colombian economy grew 4.9% in annual terms during the fourth quarter of 2013.",
        "Thus, the annual expansion of the Colombian economy for 2013 was 4.3%.",
        "In addition, the economic growth for 2012 was revised downwards (this went from 4.2% to 4.0%).With respect to demand, the significant rise in household and government consumption towards the end of the year is noteworthy.",
        "Household consumption grew 4.5% thus maintaining the pace that was seen 2012.",
        "Regarding governmental consumption, annual expansion was 6.0% for the entire year.In the case of investment, this grew 5.7% annually in 2013.",
        "This percentage is higher than the one (4.6%) in 2012.",
        "The items that contributed the most to the expansion of investment were those related to construction of public works and building.",
        "Expenditures for investing machinery and equipment slowed down significantly while those for transportation equipment shrank.That being the case, domestic demand contributed actively to the growth of economic activity, especially in the last few months of 2013 (6.2% in the fourth quarter vs4% in the first half of the year).The categories in foreign trade showed slowdowns between 2012 and 2013 which were greater for imports than for exports.",
        "For the former, growth went from 8.9% in 2012 to 2.1% in 2013 while in the case of the latter, it went from 6.1% to 5.3% respectively.With respect to supply, the sectors that showed growth that was greater than the economy as a whole in 2013 were construction (9.8%), social services (5.3%), and agriculture (5.2%).",
        "In the first case, both the subgroup of building construction and that of public works were very strong.",
        "In the last sector, the expansion was primarily due to the significant boost that coffee production received.",
        "Mining (4.9%) showed an uneven performance: while the production of petroleum grew annually at a rate that was higher than that of the other sectors (7.8%), production of coal shrank (-4.0%) as a result of various supply shocks that occurred over the course of the year.",
        "Last of all, industry showed a decline in aggregate value for the second consecutive year (-1.2%).For the first quarter of 2014, the information available shows mixed results for the performance of the economy.",
        "The figures for retail and automobile sales point to a positive performance in private consumption.",
        "According to the figures from the Monthly Retail Sample index ( in Spanish) published by DANE, sales grew 6.5% annually in January, which implies an upswing with respect to what was registered in the fourth quarter of 2013 (5.3% annually).",
        "The strongest component was that of vehicle sales which grew 19.9% annually.",
        "When the latter are excluded from the total, the annual growth was 4.0%.",
        "However, the Fedesarrollo Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) showed a significant setback in February after having shown a substantial rise during the previous month.",
        "Declines were registered in the components of both expectations and economic conditions, declines that were higher in the former than in the latter case.",
        "In spite of the above, the average for the first two months of the year was close to the average it has had since 2001.In the area of exports, the total exports in dollars fell 1.5% in January 2014 due to the combined drop in mining (-1.6%), industrial and others (-1.1%), and agricultural (-2.1%) exports.",
        "The performance of mining exports is largely due to the lower foreign sales of gold, petroleum derivatives, and coal.",
        "In the case of agricultural exports, the drop is due to the lower exports of coffee.",
        "The fall off in the exports of industrial goods and others is primarily because of the reductions in vehicles, rubber and plastic, and chemical products.",
        "These declines were partly offset by the increase in exports of food and beverages.Total imports in dollars (CIF) also registered a 6.6% drop in January 2014 with respect to the same month last year.",
        "This performance was caused by a generalized fall in the main categories with declines of 12.6% in capital goods, of 6.3% in consumer goods, and 1.9% in raw materials.In the area of supply, the indicators available for the first quarter of the year also gave mixed signals.",
        "The performance of the total demand for energy and of coffee production in February are noteworthy.",
        "Respecting the former, demand grew 6.4% annually and the level it reached surpassed the records for the last six months.",
        "In the latter, based on the figures provided by the Coffee Growers Federation production surged 39.8% compared to the same month last year.",
        "In contrast, industrial performance remained weak.",
        "According to DANE, the index of manufacturing production grew 0.1% in January.",
        "The trend for the series is still demonstrating stagnation.",
        "Note that the sector performance is quite disparate.",
        "While subbranches such as mills, milling and starches, apparel as well as other food and metal products showed high growth, other subbranches registered significant drops such as was the case with automotive vehicles, other chemical products, and publishing.Last of all, although the production of petroleum stayed at levels above one million barrels per day (1.002 mbd), it has slowed down considerably in the last four months.",
        "The annual change was at 0.5%.Thus, the technical team at the Bank holds to a forecast of economic growth that is within a range of 3.3% to 5.3% with 4.3% being the most probable figure Financial variablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) registered an annual growth rate of 12.4% in February, which is slightly higher than the level seen the previous month (12.2%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency showed a growth rate of 13.2%, which is up slightly from that of last month, while the one in foreign currency surged as it went from an annual growth rate of 0.4% to one of 1.9%.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households had an annual growth of 13.2% in February, which is slightly lower than the growth the previous month (13.5%).",
        "This was due to the performance of consumer loans, which moderated between January and February (from 12.1% to 11.6%).",
        "Loans for housing, in turn, rose as they went from growing at a rate of 15.6% to 16.1% during the same period.",
        "Regarding the commercial loan portfolio, the annual growth rate in February (12.0%) was higher than the rate for the previous month (11.5%).",
        "This was due to the upsurge in the national currency component (from 12.9% in January to 13.3% in February) and in the foreign currency component (from -0.04% to 1.7%).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -209 bp for mortgages, -199 bp for consumer loans, and -215 bp for construction loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower inflation rate.",
        "There have been reductions during this same period of: -182 bp for mortgage loans,  -171 bp for consumer loans, and -188 bp for construction loans.The levels of real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit as well as loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign contextThe latest information shows that the recovery in the Euro zone has continued at a modest pace as expected.",
        "In February, the activity indicators in the manufacturing and service sectors showed they were still growing.",
        "Meanwhile, the confidence of businessmen and consumers remained at favorable levels although there was a slight deterioration in the latter case.In the United States during the first two months of the year, some indicators showed evidence of lower than expected performance.",
        "This was the case of retail sales which had dropped in monthly terms and when compared annually, they showed a slow down.",
        "The former could be partly the result of the severe winter that country is experiencing.",
        "In contrast, industry expanded in February and the job market continued to show signs of improvement as the hiring rate rose with respect to what has been seen in the last few months.For the emerging economies, the information available indicates a slowdown in various ones.",
        "In China, the indicators for retail sales, industry, investment in fixed assets, and international trade showed a performance that was below what the market expected.",
        "Even if these figures were affected by the festivals marking the Chinese New Year, the trend is in the direction of a moderation in their economic growth.Something similar is occurring in Latin America where the latest figures on economic activity also show a greater than expected deterioration in the region’s growth.",
        "In Chile, the index of monthly economic activity showed that it had been slowing down for several full months as of January while, in Brazil, industry contracted again in annual terms.",
        "Furthermore, exports for the region remained weak and consumer confidence in several countries declined.With respect to international prices for commodities exported by Colombia, the prices for petroleum referenced to the Brent index remained close to 108 dollars per barrel in February, a level that is higher than was anticipated (105 dollars/barrel on average).",
        "The price for coal fell slightly while that for nickel showed a slight rise.",
        "The droughts in Brazil have fueled coffee prices again and these are well above what had been forecast.",
        "In the case of imported food, recoveries in the prices for soybeans, corn, and wheat have been seen in the last few weeks.Inflation in the main developed economies, in turn, remained at a relatively low level.",
        "In February, in particular, the change in the general level of prices in the Euro zone continued to decline and has been below 1% for several full months now.",
        "In the United States, the indicators showed stability.",
        "In the emerging economies, inflation started to climb again in several Latin American countries and this could be associated with the depreciation of their currencies.",
        "In contrast, there was a slight slowdown in Asia.In terms of monetary policy, the central banks in the major advanced economies, excluding the United States, continued their stimulus policies and not announce any new measures.",
        "In the case of the Fed, the decision was made to continue cutting back on their asset purchases by an additional ten billion dollars in their March meeting.",
        "In addition, they announced that it would be appropriate to maintain the stimulus policy given the current economic conditions.",
        "Likewise, the Fed ruled out a fixed target for the unemployment rate and conditioned their policy to a broader range of indicators for the labor market, inflation, and the financial markets.",
        "In the opinion of many analysts, the likelihood of earlier increases in the rates has risen.Among the emerging economies, some countries such as Chile, Hungary, and Romania reduced their benchmark rates as a reaction to the slowdown in their productive activity indicators.",
        "Other countries that face higher inflationary pressures, such as Brazil and India, increased their rates.Finally, so far this year, the measures of country risk and the exchange rate have remained at levels above the averages registered in 2013.",
        "If the monetary policy conditions in the United States are normalized and this is confirmed, it is likely that the exchange and the risk rate levels will remain stable or rise slightly.",
        "However, the recent announcement by JP Morgan with respect to the increase in the share of TES in its benchmark portfolio for emerging markets (in local currencies) may significantly offset these effects AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) The recent data on economic activity from various parts of the world suggest that the growth recovery will continue in 2014 but at a slightly slower pace in comparison to previous predictions.",
        "The recovery in the Euro zone has continued at a modest rate while, at the same time, the slowdown in some emerging economies has accentuated.",
        "(ii) Foreign interest rates and the price of the dollar are surpassing the averages seen in 2013.",
        "It is probable that a significant part of those rises will be permanent to the extent that they are due to less expansionary levels of global liquidity.",
        "The recent decision by the Federal Reserve and forecasts made by its members for the benchmark interest rate reaffirm this trend.",
        "(iii) The increased weight Colombian public debt securities have in the benchmark portfolios of some international investors could offset to some degree the effects that the adjustment in global liquidity has on the exchange rate and market interest rates in Colombia.",
        "(iv) In the fourth quarter of 2013, the annual growth of output was 4.9%.",
        "For the entire year it was 4.3% which is above the revised rate of 4% for 2012.",
        "Growth surged in the second half of the year driven especially by investment.",
        "Household consumption remained at growth rates that are close to their historical average over the course of the year while public consumption grew more than the output every quarter.",
        "With respect to supply, the sectors with the highest growth for the quarter were in mining, agriculture, construction, and personal and social services.",
        "Industry showed a poor performance.",
        "Similar trends were seen for the entire year.",
        "(v) Recent information on the growth of retail sales, coffee production, energy consumption, and the continued decline of unemployment suggests a strongly dynamic economy over the course of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, the drop off in consumer confidence in February as well as the weakness in exports and in manufacturing point in the opposite direction.",
        "For 2014, the Bank’s technical team still forecasts that economic growth will be between 3.3% and 5.3% with 4.3% as the most probable figure.",
        "(vi) In February, the growth of credit as a whole stabilized at rates that were higher than the rise in the nominal GDP.",
        "The growth of consumer loans has moderated, but mortgage loans have surged.",
        "The real interest rates for loans remain at levels that drive economic growth.",
        "(vii) Annual inflation rose in February for the third consecutive month and was at 2.32% which is within the target range.",
        "The average for the measures of core inflation also continued to rise and came to 2.63%.",
        "The inflation expectations of economic analysts for a year from now as well as those derived from public debt paper with maturities of less than five years remain at around 3%.",
        "To summarize, economic growth surged in the second half of 2013 and inflation continued rising in February.",
        "Interest rates remain at levels that stimulate aggregate expenditure, and they are expected to contribute to making output approach the economy’s productive capacity and inflation converge with the goal of 3% in 2014.The members of the Board of Directors emphasized the strength of domestic demand with respect to both consumption and investment that was seen in the second half of 2013 and beginning of this year.",
        "Inflation has also risen as expected.",
        "The above could indicate that the output gap and the current deviation of observed inflation from the target (inflation gap) will continue closing over the course of 2014 DECISIONThe Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on October 30, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of how Banco de la República’s technical team views the macroeconomic situation (Section 1), followed by a review of the key policy discussion points considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2).A more detaileddescription of the macroeconomic situationprepared by the technical staff from the Central Bank is provided in the data section of the September 2014 edition of the Inflation Report, as well as in the statistical appendix CONTEXTRegarding the macroeconomic context, the technical staff highlights the following elements:The information ratified the weak growth of world economy.",
        "United States showed a good performance, while in the euro zone the product recorded a modest increase.",
        "In most Latin American countries, the growth of the GDPs were lower than their historic averages.",
        "All this considered, the forecast of a weak growth in the average of our commercial partners for 2014 and 2015 was maintained.",
        "External demand will continue to be slow next year, except for the economy of the US.The prices of oil fell strongly.",
        "This behavior, which pressures world inflation downwards, could also contribute to encourage spending, especially in those countries which are importers of oil.",
        "For economies which are exporters of oil, the fall in these prices generates deterioration of the terms of trade and therefore a reduction of their national income.Facing the prospect of low inflation in the United States and greater risks of a slowdown in world trade, on average, the market expects the first increase in the interest rate of the FED to take place towards the end of 2015.",
        "This has happened together with a slight decreasing trend in the long-term interest rates.The measures for risk premia of various countries in the euro zone as well as of some emerging economies continued to increase, although moderately.",
        "The flow of capital toward these countries has reduced and their currencies have depreciated against the dollar.For Colombia, the fall in the international price of oil has implied deterioration in the terms of trade, in spite of the fact that the international prices of coffee continue to be high.",
        "Should this trend continue, the national income will continue to be affected negatively.Weakness in the external demand and the lower international prices of mining commodities have been reflected on the behavior of the exports of the country, in dollars.",
        "So far this year until September, the total external sales have fallen 1.9% on a yearly basis.",
        "Those of agricultural origin have presented high increases due to the exports of coffee and banana, while those of mining origin and those of other sectors have decreased.",
        "In the accumulated value from January to September, the imports in dollars have grown 7.4%, as explained by the increase of raw materials, those destined to consumption, and to a smaller extent, those of capital goods.The new figures of foreign trade validate the projection of a greater deficit in the current account for 2014: between 4.4% and 4.8% of the GDP.",
        "This widening implies a smaller current surplus in the mining sector and supposes that the wide use of the external savings by the remaining sectors would have continued in the second half of the year.As for Colombia’s economic growth, the most recent indicators of supply and demand suggest that in the second half of 2014 the GDP would grow at a good pace, although less than the one registered in the first half of the year.",
        "The main impulse would stem from internal demand.",
        "This is suggested by the behavior of retail sales, consumption credit, consumer confidence index, and that of the labor market, which indicate that consumption would maintain a strong momentum.",
        "The increase in the external purchases of machinery and transportation equipment, and the trend registered by works, anticipate a good performance of investment, although at lower rates than those observed for the first half of the year.",
        "The figures of foreign trade indicate that imports would increase more than exports, and with this the balance of trade would contribute negatively to the product.In October, banking credit continued to slow down, but still recorded annual rates larger than the nominal GDP estimated for the present year.",
        "The lowest dynamism was that of private companies.",
        "In the same period, the slowdown in mortgage loans was more than compensated by the recovery of the consumption portfolio, therefore household credit accelerated.",
        "All this takes place in a context of weak transmission of the increases of the benchmark interest rate towards the loan rates.Given the aforesaid, the technical staff maintained the projection for the range for annual economic growth for all of 2014 between 4.5% and 5.5%, with 5% as the most probable figure.Regarding prices, as expected by the technical staff, annual inflation increased from 2.86% in September to 3.29% in October.",
        "This is explained by acceleration in the group of foods and regulated goods, and the low base for comparison of the CPI from a year before.",
        "The four measurements of core inflation increased, and their average posted at 2.76%.So far this year until October, accumulated inflation reached 3.25%.",
        "With this result, by the end of 2014 inflation will post in the upper part of the target range for this year (between 2.0% and 4.0%).",
        "Analysts’ inflation expectations derived from public debt bonds on a one year horizon as well as for 2, 3, and 5 years, are all anchored close to the target.So far, depreciation of the peso has been partially transmitted to the CPI of tradable goods without food or regulated goods.",
        "However, should the depreciation persist, this could be transmitted to a greater extent to internal prices, generating greater inflation expectations.In summary, aggregate demand continues to show a strong growth in a context close to the full use of the productive capacity.",
        "As was expected, inflation increased, a fact explained by the greater pace of increase in the prices of food, which is expected to be transitory.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations remain stable, and are somewhat over 3.0%.",
        "This takes place within an environment of deterioration of the terms of trade and of uncertainty about the recovery of the economic activity worldwide together with the cost of external financing, which are factors that may impact aggregate demand as well as the exchange rate AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.The members of the Board highlighted the strong dynamism of the Colombian economy, and a more adverse external environment in the horizon of monetary policy.The strong fall in the international prices of oil and other commodities consolidates a weak external scenario that will affect the performance of the Colombian economy negatively during 2015.",
        "As was expected, the Colombian peso has depreciated, which may buffer the effects of the weakness of external variables on the output gap, and might have an effect on short-term inflation.",
        "The floating exchange rate regime has proven to be an efficient mechanism to absorb external shocks.Inflation expectations are anchored to levels close to the target.",
        "The average of the core inflation indicators converges towards that target, while total inflation registers a higher value due to transitory shocks in supply.Under these conditions, the Board Members agreed to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered, as well as to continue monitoring the performance of the economy DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on June 20, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.A synthesis is presented below of the view held by the Banco de la República’s technical team with respect to the macroeconomic situation (section 1) and, afterwards, the main discussion points regarding policy considered by the Board of Directors are summed up (section 2).A moredetailed explanation of the macroeconomic situationwritten by the technical team at the Banco de la República is presented in the data section of the May 2014 Inflation Report and in the statistics appendixMACROECONOMIC CONTEXTWith respect to the macroeconomic context, the technical team would like to draw attention to the following points:The information available indicates that the main developed countries continue to expand at a moderate rate.",
        "In the case of the United States, the recovery in manufacturing, retail sales, creation of employment, and consumer confidence seem to suggest a recovery of economic activity in comparison to the first quarter based on the indicators as of May.",
        "In spite of that, the World Bank and some analysts recently lowered their growth predictions for this economy for 2014.",
        "With respect to the economy in the euro zone, this has continued to grow at a modest pace in spite of the improvement in consumer and producer confidence.",
        "The growth of the emerging economies in Asia has stabilized while, with the exception of Colombia, a slowdown has predominated in several countries in Latin America.",
        "The performance of commodity prices has been mixed.",
        "The price for petroleum remains above what was forecast by the technical team at the Bank for 2014 and, in the last few weeks, it has rallied due to geopolitical factors.",
        "The price for coal remained stable and that for nickel has shown an upward trend so far this year in spite of a drop in the last four weeks.",
        "The price for coffee showed a decline.",
        "In the case of prices for imported food such as wheat and corn, decreases were seen in the last few weeks.",
        "In the euro zone, the risk of deflation persists.",
        "This has led the European Central Bank to announce new monetary stimulus measures.",
        "In Japan and the United States inflation has risen recently just as it has in several economies in Latin America.",
        "In Asia, there is stability.",
        "The global financial markets have shown a favorable performance in the last few weeks.",
        "The indices of stock market activity appreciated and the perception of risk declined.",
        "In Latin America, the risk premiums continued dropping while the exchange rates for the main currencies with respect to the dollar have shown different reactions.",
        "In the cases of Chile and Peru, there has been a certain amount of stability which contrasts with the ups and downs that have been seen in Brazil and the downward trend in Colombia.",
        "In the latter case, this is the result of the inflow of capital related to the changes in the JP Morgan benchmark portfolios.",
        "Nevertheless, the signs of a better economic performance in the US and its effect on the expectations of an adjustment in the policy interest rates in that country make the future trend of the exchange rates in the region particularly uncertain In April, the value of Colombian exports in dollars declined in comparison to the same month last year.",
        "This was due to the general fall in the main items (mining and industrial products and the top agricultural goods).",
        "In the cumulative January-April period foreign sales of mining products were lower because of the lower prices while sales of agricultural products grew.",
        "For non-traditional exports, the contraction was largely the result of decreases registered in foreign sales of vehicles and of agricultural products other than coffee, bananas, and flowers.",
        "The annual growth of the GDP for the first quarter of 2014 was 6.4% and the growth for 2013 was revised upwards.",
        "In the area of supply, the positive strength of all branches of activity is noteworthy, especially the construction, social services, agricultural, and financial sectors.",
        "It should be noted that industry registered a growth of 3.3% after two years of negative rates.",
        "Although the GDP figures with respect to demand have not been published yet, the information available suggests that the surge in economic activity was due to the strength of domestic demand and due especially to the investment component (as shown by the growth of the construction sector and the data on imports of capital goods for industry and agriculture).",
        "For the second quarter, the indicators for sales and consumer confidence indicate that household consumption is remaining strong.",
        "Specifically, the figures for vehicle sales published by Fenalco and Econometria suggest that the consumption of durable consumer goods will have registered a favorable performance in the second quarter.",
        "The above is consistent with the behavior of the consumer loan portfolio in May which stopped slowing down and registered a slight rise in its growth rate.",
        "The labor market indicators, in turn, continue to suggest that there are improvements to labor conditions.",
        "The growth of employment has stayed at acceptable rates in the last few months and is mainly concentrated in wage-earning jobs To the above add the fact that the real interest rates are dropping for households as well as for commercial loans and both are below the average they have had since 2000 as a result of the rise in inflation and its effect on expectations.",
        "This could be a factor that might explain the rally that has been seen in the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios.",
        "The positive trend for the mortgage portfolio has likewise been improving.",
        "In May, annual consumer inflation continued the upward trend it has been on since the beginning of the year.",
        "This upswing is mainly due to the behavior of food prices.",
        "So far this year, food has also been the item that has contributed the most to the increase in inflation.",
        "Two aspects of the recent performance of the variation in consumer prices should be noted: i) The CPI excluding food was the only indicator of core inflation that declined, and ii) the indicators of expectations are showing rises and some are beginning to surpass the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The state of the economy as described by the growth data in the first quarter, the positive indicators for the second quarter that are known, and the possible upward revision of the forecast of the GDP for the full year that this could mean suggest that demand is growing at a pace that is higher than the potential GDP.",
        "The above combined with the record of some expectations of rising inflation increases the probability that inflationary pressure may be spreading throughout the entire economy.",
        "To summarize, it can be stated that the most recent data show an economy and inflation that are growing more rapidly than predicted as a result of which expectations have been pressured upwards.",
        "The real interest rate is still remaining at a low level (compared to its average since 2000) and could continue stimulating domestic demandDISCUSSION AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors agreed that the economy grew more strongly than expected in the first quarter of the year and better than what had been considered in the models produced by the Bank’s technical team.",
        "Furthermore, apart from the different opinions about the growth of the potential GDP, the gap is closing at a more accelerated pace than had been previously forecast or even, in the opinion of some members, has closed.Regarding inflation, the members of the Board agreed that in spite of the fact that expectations had risen recently, they are still anchored to the target.",
        "They also agreed that a large part of the increase in the annual change in consumer prices was due to the expected reversal for some perishable foods as well as in the reduction of the increases in prices for some regulated goods and services.",
        "Several members of the Board stated that inflationary pressure could be emerging from the upsurge in demand.",
        "Another added that, in the recent past, the changes in the inflation rate have been fundamentally determined by the performance of food prices, especially for perishables, and that said performance, in turn, has been the result of climatic factors, , the result of supply shocks instead of an excess of demand.The Board indicated that a gradual adjustment in the benchmark interest rate was justified considering the following aspects: (i) the volatility and uncertainty of the data on public investment which has been the main unexpected outcome with respect to growth, (ii) the weakening of international trade, and (iii) the impacts of the monetary policy of the United States.The members of the Board of Directors decided that, in the abovementioned context, it is necessary to continue the process of normalizing the monetary policy and closely monitoring the reaction of the financial system balancesPOLICY DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided unanimously that it would be appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp and set it at 4%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on April 25, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2) AND GROWTHa.Recent Developments in InflationIn March 2014, annual consumer inflation rose again for the fourth month in a row.",
        "The amount reported by DANE was 2.51% which is 19 basis points (bp) higher than what was seen in February.",
        "So far this year, the CPI has accumulated an increase of 1.52% which is above what was registered for the same period in 2013 (0.95%).",
        "Just as in the previous two months, the upward pressures were mainly concentrated in the prices for food and regulated items although a slight rise in the basket of tradables was also seen.In the basket for food, the annual change closed the month at 2.2%, 45 bp higher than in February.",
        "The surge occurred in the three main components of this basket: perishables (from 2.6% to 3.2% annually), processed foods (from 0.4% to 0.9% annually) and meals away from home (from 3.9% to 4.1% annually).",
        "In the case of the perishable food component, the prices are returning to normal after the low levels at the end of last year.",
        "The rises in the prices for processed food would be associated with the depreciation of the peso.Within the CPI excluding food (2.6% annually, 9 bp more than last month), the main upward pressures came from the group of regulated items.",
        "This basket (2.2% annually) registered a rise of 45 bp in its annual variation compared to the previous month which was due to increases in the rates for natural gas.",
        "Respecting the CPI for electricity, a significant surge in the annual change was also seen, but in this case, it was mainly the result of a low base of comparison (these rates fell in March 2013).The annual change in the CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated items (1.6%) showed an increase of 4 bp in comparison to the previous month.",
        "The rising trend in this basket is still related to the accumulated depreciation in the exchange rate.",
        "The annual change for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items (3.55%), in turn, was 6 bp lower than the month before.",
        "Note the annual change for rent (3.5%) which dipped slightly after the upticks seen for the previous two months.The average for the four indicators of core inflation monitored by the Banco de la Republica was at 2.69% in March, 6 bp higher than the previous month and 19 bp higher than it was at the end of last year.",
        "Thus, there have been slight rises in that variable for a full period of five consecutive months.The annual change in the PPI was upward for the fifth consecutive month and came to 2.6% compared to the 1.3% from the previous month.",
        "This is mainly explained by the greater adjustment in the local component (from 0.6% to 2.3% annually).",
        "The annual change in the imported PPI was a small uptick (from 4.28% to 4.34%).",
        "The depreciation of the peso, the increase in the prices for perishables and coffee explain this performance.Inflation expectations continued their gradual rise.",
        "According to the monthly survey of financial market analysts done by the Banco de la Republica, the inflation expected for December of this year had climbed to 3.04% in comparison to the 2.90% from last month.",
        "There was a similar change in the expectations for 12 months from now which went from 3.0% to 3.1%.",
        "Regarding the expectations derived from the TES yield curve in the last four weeks (ending April 21) there was a rise in the horizons for the 2-, 3-, and 5-year securities which came very close to the long term inflation target GrowthThe available information suggests that, in the first few months of 2014, economic activity has expanded at a rate similar to that registered towards the end of last year.",
        "Private consumption has grown at a favorable rate while investment, above all that related to transportation equipment and public works construction, has been more moderate.",
        "Note that the performance of the means of production has been influenced by a higher number of working days due to the fact that Easter week was in April (and not in March as it was in 2013).",
        "The facts that confirm the positive outlook for household consumption are: the Monthly Retail Sample Index ( in Spanish) published by the National Bureau of Statistics (DANE in Spanish) which shows that sales grew 6.7% annually in February.",
        "This is one of the highest figures in the last 24 months.",
        "When vehicle sales were discounted, the increase was 4.6%.",
        "The performance of vehicle sales also suggests a positive result in expenditures for durable goods.",
        "However, in the first three months of the year, the consumer confidence index published by Fedesarrollo was, on average, below the figure for the fourth quarter of 2013.",
        "In spite of the preceding, this series was higher than the historical average since 2001.",
        "In line with this, the sales balance from the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) shows that the merchants saw a slightly higher demand in January and February than what was seen in the fourth quarter of 2013.",
        "Last of all, the favorable performance of the labor market, especially the higher growth of salaried employment as well as the fact that the financing of household consumption, in spite of the fact that it has slowed down slightly since the beginning of the year, also continues to grow at a positive pace are contributing to the favorable performance of this item.With respect to investment, information is scarce.",
        "Based on the EMEE balance of investment expectations, gross capital formation excluding public works projects and construction will have remained dynamic for the first quarter of the year.In February, the total  exports registered a drop of 8.5% due to the combined fall of mining products (-10.3%) and industrial products and others (-15.1%).",
        "For the first group, the reduction was due to the lower foreign sales of crude oil (-12.2%), gold (-48%), and coal (-6.6%).",
        "In the second one, it was mainly because of the drop in vehicle exports (-67.5%).",
        "Exports of the main agricultural products, in turn, grew 34.4% as a whole (bananas 90.1%, coffee 20%, and flowers 31.8%).In the area of supply, the indicators available for the first quarter of 2014 showed a mixed performance.",
        "Figures from sectors such as industry, energy, and commerce show favorable performance with respect to what was seen in the last quarter of 2013 while some indicators associated with branches of activity such as construction, mining, and agriculture reported some slowdowns.Industry showed a positive but moderate expansion.",
        "The annual change in the IPI excluding coffee threshing was 2.8% for the month of February.",
        "In industry, the sectoral disparities continued.",
        "According to the Fedesarrollo survey of business owners’ opinions in March, the indicator for purchase orders and its trend continued rising slowly.",
        "The inventory indicator (counter-cyclical to production) rose a little but, it continued its downward trend.",
        "The expectations for production in three months stayed at acceptable levels and ones that were similar to those seen the month before.",
        "All of this points to a favorable performance this month.",
        "Industry’s demand for non-regulated energy continued growing quite dynamically in March (22.1% compared to 15.2% in February).",
        "It should be noted that part of this could be due to a low basis of comparison with the same month last year because of the Easter week effect.For other sectors, the indicators that performed well were: demand for overall energy which grew 5.7% in March and 5.0% for the first quarter, cement production which rose at an annual rate of 10.2% in February and 6.1% in first two months, and coffee production which continued to expand at significant rates in the first three months of the year (29%).",
        "In the case of petroleum production, however, a significant slowdown was seen in the first quarter and, in March, the level of production fell below one million barrels per day.",
        "All of the above makes it possible to set the predicted range for the annual growth of the GDP between 4.2% and 5.4% for the first quarter of 2014.",
        "For all of 2014, the growth range for output remains between 3.3% and 5.3% with 4.3% being the most probable figure Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) registered an annual growth rate of 12.8% in March, which is slightly higher than the level seen in the previous month (12.4%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency showed an annual expansion rate of 13.5%, which is up slightly from that of last month (13.1%) while the one in foreign currency surged as it went from an annual growth rate of 2.0% to one of 2.5%.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households registered an annual growth of 12.9% in March, which is slightly lower than the growth seen the month before (13.3%).",
        "This was due to the performance of consumer loans, which moderated between February and March (from 11.6% to 11.3%).",
        "The growth rate for housing loans (16.2%), in turn, not change over these two months.",
        "Regarding the commercial loan portfolio, the annual growth rate in March (12.8%) was higher than the rate for the previous month (12.0%).",
        "This was because of the upsurge in the national currency component (from 13.3% in February to 14.1% in March) and in the foreign currency component (from 1.7% to 2.3%).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the policy rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of -205 bp for mortgages, -221 bp for consumer loans, and -210 bp for construction loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been similar due to the fact that the recent rise in inflation has brought it closer to the July 2012 level.",
        "During this same period, the decline has been: -188 bp for mortgage loans, -203 bp for consumer loans, and -193 bp for construction loans.The levels of real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit as well as loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign ContextEconomic activity continued to expand in the main developed countries during the first quarter of 2014.",
        "In the emerging countries, in turn, the growth rate continued to moderate.In the United States, the extreme winter conditions in January and February affected economic activity.",
        "Nevertheless, recent information makes it evident that the economy is expanding at a favorable rate.",
        "Based on the March figures, industrial production and retail sales rallied in both annual and monthly terms.",
        "With respect to the labor market, the unemployment rate rose slightly over the last few months, however, the rate of job creation increased.Economic activity in the euro zone, in turn, continues to recover at a modest rate.",
        "Based on the March figures, the opinion indicators in the manufacturing and service sectors remained in expansionary territory.",
        "At the same time, the confidence indices for business owners and consumers showed a positive trend again.",
        "Other indicators such as retail sales and industrial production also showed improvement.In the case of the emerging economies, growth of the GDP in China slowed down during the first quarter of the year as it went from 7.7% to 7.4% annually.",
        "Exports and domestic demand grew less than they during the previous period.",
        "This shows that the effect of the loss of strength in worldwide demand on the growth of the Chinese economy is not being offset by an expansion in their domestic market as many analysts expected.",
        "In Latin America, the indicators of productive activity continued to expand at a slower pace than in previous years.",
        "The low pace of growth in Brazil and the slowdown in the Chilean economy are especially notable.Regarding international prices for commodities exported by Colombia, petroleum prices remained at favorable levels slightly below the average for 2013.",
        "Prices for coffee and nickel rose again last month.",
        "Prices for some imported food items, in turn, continued to rise.With respect to inflation in the main developed economies, changes in prices remained low in Europe while in the United States, there was a slight rally although it stayed below the authorities’ target.",
        "In the case of Japan, the relaxation of monetary policy continues to be reflected in growing inflation.With low inflationary pressure and growth that is below its potential, the main central banks have maintained an expansionary monetary posture.",
        "In the case of the United States Federal Reserve, the cutbacks in monthly purchases of assets remained in line with what was expected by the market and the first increase in the benchmark rate is expected to occur towards -2015.",
        "The long term rates have remained relatively stable.In the case of the euro zone, in view of deflation fears, analysts predict that new monetary stimulus measures such as the purchase of financial assets will be implemented.In the emerging economies, the inflationary panorama remains mixed as do the monetary policy responses.",
        "In Latin America, some countries have shown evidence of rises in prices.",
        "In the case of Brazil, the central bank increased their rates again while the central bank of Chile lowered theirs.",
        "In other countries in this region, interest rates have remained stable.Since the beginning of the year, global risk aversion has moderated and the risk premiums in the main countries in this region have declined.",
        "This has been reflected in these emerging economies in the appreciation of the financial assets in local currency and in the appreciation of the currency with respect to the dollar.",
        "The preceding changes have been more accentuated in Colombia, especially in the public debt market as a result of the higher inflows of foreign capital.",
        "Foreign interest rates have not presented significant changes and remain at levels that are low but higher than the average seen in 2013.To summarize, the above facts indicate that the average growth for Colombia’s trading partners in 2014 will be similar to what was registered in 2013 and that the terms of trade average is remaining at favorable levels.",
        "Expectations regarding the slow liquidity adjustment in the United States remain the same.Likewise, the expansionary monetary posture in other advanced economies is expected to persist for a lengthy period AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) Inflation and the average for the four measurements of core inflation continued to converge towards 3% in March.",
        "The inflation expectations, in turn, of economic analysts for a year from now as well as those that are implicit in public debt paper have fluctuated around the long term inflation target.",
        "(ii) The macroeconomic forecast indicates that domestic demand will continue to grow at a favorable rate and that the economy will draw close to full use of its productive capacity in 2014.",
        "As the same time, the unemployment rate that is not seasonally adjusted has continued on a downward trend and reached the lowest level seen so far this century.",
        "(iii) To the degree that inflation has been converging with the target of 3%, the different, real interest rates have dropped.",
        "In March, the growth of loans as a whole surged slightly driven by the performance of commercial loans and mortgages.",
        "(iv) The risk premiums for various emerging economies have declined recently, financial assets in local currency have appreciated, and their currencies have also appreciated with respect to the dollar.",
        "The preceding changes have been more accentuated in Colombia, especially in the public debt market as a result of the higher inflows of foreign capital.",
        "(v) The recent data on global economic activity suggest that the worldwide recovery will continue in 2014.",
        "In the United States, the latest numbers indicate that economic activity could maintain a gradual recovery while the expansion in the Euro zone will continue at a modest rate.",
        "The slowdown in some emerging economies may become more accentuated.",
        "With that, it is likely that the average growth for Colombia’s trading partners in 2014 will be similar to the rise registered in 2013 and that the average for the terms of trade will remain at high levels.",
        "(vi) Expectations for a slow adjustment to the liquidity in the United States are staying the same.",
        "Likewise, the expansionary monetary posture in other advanced economies is expected to persist for a lengthy period.",
        "The foreign interest rates have not shown significant changes and remain at low levels although higher than the average seen in 2013.The majority of the members of the Board thought that macroeconomic stability and the current convergence of inflation with the long term target would be compatible with a monetary policy posture that was a little less expansionary than the current one.",
        "They also thought that a gradual and timely adjustment of the latter would reduce the need for abrupt changes in the future and ensure macroeconomic stability.",
        "Considering all of this and the lags between actions taken based on monetary policy and their effect on inflation and growth, raising the benchmark interest rate 25 basis points was thought to be prudent.One member of the Board expressed the need to keep the benchmark interest rate unaltered in consideration of the fact that inflation expectations are in perfect alignment with the target of 3% fixed by the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica.",
        "In addition, according to the Bank’s technical team, the most probable growth figure for 2014, 4.3%, implies that the output gap will remain in negative territory over the course of the year.",
        "These considerations suggest that the monetary policy posture should be kept unchanged until more information on the changes in economic activity in the first quarter of the year is available DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided by majority vote that it would be appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp and set it at 3.5%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the information available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on August 29, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of how Banco de la República’s technical team views the macroeconomic situation (Section 1), followed by a review of the key policy discussion points considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2).Amore detailed description of the macroeconomic situation, prepared by Banco de la República’s technical team, is provided in the data section of the June 2014 edition of the Inflation Report and in the statistical appendixTHE CONTEXTThe technical team underscores the following aspects with respect to the macroeconomic context:The new information in this report suggests the average growth forecast for Colombia's trading partners in 2014 could be somewhat lower compared to the last report.",
        "This is the result of no growth in the euro area during the second quarter and a sharper slowdown than expected in several countries of the region.",
        "GDP growth in the United States during the same period was in line with the forecast and is consistent with the annual estimate.",
        "Added momentum in external demand is expected for the second half of the year, due to the rebound in economic activity forecast for the United States.So far in August, long-term interest rates in the United States continued on a downward trend, but are still above the average observed in 2013.",
        "The US Federal Reserve’s financial asset buying program is expected to culminate in October 2014.",
        "Generally speaking, the market assumes the first increase in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate will occur in -2015.Global geopolitical tensions and government debt problems in Argentina have sparked volatility in measurements of global risk and in the countries of the region.",
        "Nevertheless, these measurements for Colombia remained at low levels in August and were under the average for 2013.Terms of trade were at a somewhat lower level in the second quarter of 2014 compared to a year ago.",
        "They are expected to continue on a slight downward trend for rest of the year, but will help to keep national revenue at what can be considered record highs.The annual decline in the dollar value of exports during the second quarter of 2014 was similar in comparison to the first three months of the year.",
        "On this occasion, the biggest reduction was in exports of industrial goods, while the decline in mining exports was less than in the first quarter.",
        "Exports of the major agricultural products continued to exhibit substantial momentum, propelled by foreign sales of coffee and bananas.",
        "As such, the total value of exports in dollars during the first half of the year accumulated an annual reduction of 4.5%.As for imports in dollars, their value rose at a higher annual rate during the second quarter than in the first.",
        "The build-up in foreign purchases centered on imports for end consumption and capital goods.",
        "As a result, annual import growth during the first half of the year was 6.1%.Given these trends in foreign commerce, the trade balance for all of 2014 will likely be negative and the current account deficit is expected to be higher than in 2013.",
        "However, it is important to bear in mind that the supply shock caused by temporary closure of the Cartagena refinery could explain part of the growth in this deficit.On the domestic front, new information at the close of June suggests second-quarter growth would be in line with the forecast presented in the last quarterly report on inflation.",
        "Real household spending would continue to increase at a good pace, although less so than at the start of the year.",
        "Investment also is expected to expand at a slower pace, closer to its historical growth rate.On the supply side, the increase in investment in works and building construction during the second quarter is expected to be sizeable, but less than during the first quarter.",
        "Industrial production (including coffee processing) could be somewhat less in relation to a year ago, partly because of a temporary supply shock in the petroleum by-products sector and fewer business days in April (due to the Easter holiday).Economic figures for the third quarter are scarce and suggest mixed signals.",
        "On the one hand, the new information at July with respect to the Consumer Confidence Index, merchants’ expectations, automobiles sales and consumer loans indicate household spending continued to grow at an acceptable pace.",
        "Likewise, the industrial survey suggests the sector continued to recover.",
        "However, oil production was down again in July to under one million barrels per day.The increase in the bank loan portfolio in domestic currency slowed during July and so far in August, compared to the first half of the year.",
        "Not as much momentum in commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, in mortgages explains this deceleration.",
        "However, consumer loans continue to grow at a steady pace.",
        "Loans of all types registered annual increases higher than the current year forecast for nominal GDP growth.Pass-through of the benchmark interest rate hikes to interest rates on loans weakened in July.",
        "In real terms, all interest rates on loans (except cards) are below the average calculated since 2000.Given all the above, the technical team kept the forecast for growth in the second quarter of 2014 at 3.6% to 5.0%, with 4.3% as the most likely figure.",
        "The range for 2014 as a whole is still between 4.2% and 5.8%, with 5% being more likely.",
        "The models suggest the output gap could be slightly positive this year.In July, annual inflation resumed its convergence towards the long-term target and was 2.89%.",
        "As has often been the case so far this year, the build-up in inflation last month was explained by the upward trend in the annual variation in prices for regulated items and food.The average of the core inflation measurements declined during the past two months and was 2.58% in July.",
        "This slowdown also was observed in tradables and non-tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "The expectations of analysts for inflation at one year and those based on government bonds at two, three and five years remain near or slightly above the long-term target (3%).In summary, the new information at hand points to a continuation of the momentum in the country's aggregate demand.",
        "The forecasts indicate domestic spending will keep growing at a good pace, accompanied by a slower than projected recovery in external demand.",
        "While the downward trend in the unemployment rate could reflect structural factors, the strength of aggregate demand might take it to levels that would bring wage-cost pressure to bear on prices.",
        "Inflation resumed its convergence towards the long-term target, and short-term inflation forecasts and expectations remain slightly above 3%, even though the measurements of core inflation have declined in the last two months.",
        "Pass-through of the benchmark rate hikes to interest rates in the financial system has weakened, coupled with less of an increase in lendingDISCUSSION AND OPTIONSThe Board, by a majority vote, decided it was appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.5%.A number of Board members agreed on the decision to increase the rate, considering the information on economic growth is still positive in most of the sectors analyzed.",
        "Furthermore, the real interest rate continues to stimulate economic activity.Another member of the Board stated the 25 bp increase would culminate the process begun in April of this year to normalize monetary policy.Several members believe there is evidence of an adjustment in certain key economic variables, which they see as confirmation that the monetary policy is having an effect, both on growth and inflation, particularly on the core inflation indicators.",
        "Some of them believe the risk balance recommends increasing the policy rate by 25 basis points to ensure consolidation of the process to normalize the stance of monetary policy and to anchor inflation expectations to the target.",
        "Others believe any further increase in the benchmark rate is unnecessary, considering the time it takes monetary policy to have an effect.",
        "Accordingly, they voted to hold the rate at 4.25% and emphasized there are exogenous factor that would be helping to slow economic activity DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by a majority vote, considered it appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.5%",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on February 28, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.",
        "These minutes contain a summary of inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future, which was prepared by the Bank’s technical staff (Section 1), in addition to a review of the key deliberations and policy options considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2) AND GROWTHa.Recent Developments in InflationIn January, annual consumer inflation (2.13%) registered a surge of 19 basis points (bp) compared to what was registered in December.",
        "A rise in both the annual change in food prices (1.2% annually) and in the prices of the basket excluding food (2.5% annually) were seen.In the basket for food, the annual variation was 1.20% at the end of the month or 34 bp higher than in December.",
        "The surge was concentrated in the prices of perishable food (from -0.2% to 2.1% annually).",
        "The adjustment in the prices for processed foods, in turn, (-0.2% annually) stayed in negative territory with no significant changes while the meals away from home component remained stable (3.3% annually).The main upward pressures in the CPI excluding food came from the groups of regulated items and tradables.",
        "In the regulated prices (1.7% annually) a rise of 61 bp was registered in the annual variation in comparison to the previous month.The rise in the price for fuel in January after 5 consecutive months of negative adjustments is the most notable.",
        "There was a large adjustment, likewise, in the prices for public transportation resulting from the changes in fees for Bogota.",
        "The annual change in the CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated prices, in turn, went from 1.4% in December to 1.6% in January.",
        "This could be due to the recent behavior of the exchange rate.In January, the annual change in the CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices (3.6% annually) showed a 15 bp decline, which is the lowest level since June 2012.",
        "The behavior of this indicator would suggest very low demand pressure on the consumer prices at the beginning of the year.",
        "In the case of rent, the annual change continued to fall very slowly and was at 3.5%.The average of the four indicators of core inflation monitored by the Banco de la República was 2.55% in January, 5 bp higher than the previous month.",
        "This measurement has shown few changes since the beginning of 2013 and has fluctuated around 2.5%.The annual change in the PPI climbed 72 bp in January and was in positive territory (0.2%) for the first time since September 2012.",
        "To a large degree, this change in the trend could be related to the depreciation of the peso and has occurred mainly in the import PPI (the annual change was a 121 bp rise in January compared to December).",
        "However, there was also a surge in the PPI for locally produced and consumed goods (the annual change was a 61 bp rise last month).In January, the different measurements of inflation expectations stayed close to 3.0%.",
        "The figure derived from the monthly survey of financial market analysts was 2.9% for a horizon of 12 months from now and 2.8% for December 2014.",
        "The expectations derived from the TES curve yield for 2-, 3-, and 5-year maturities rose in January and over the course of February (on average) and are around 3.0% GrowthRecent information for the last quarter of 2013 indicates that productive activity expanded at a rate that was below what was registered for the third quarter.",
        "Nonetheless, this is expected to be above the average for the first half of the year.",
        "Although the situation indicators available for January 2014 are still very limited, they suggest that that performance has continued.For December 2013, according to the Monthly Retail Sample index ( in Spanish) published by DANE, retail sales grew 4.1% annually, a record that is lower than what was reported during the previous two months.",
        "However, the average of this indicator for the fourth quarter rose 5% compared to the same period in 2012.",
        "This figure is close to what was seen for the third quarter (4.9%).",
        "When vehicle sales are discounted, growth in December was 4.6% while the average for the fourth quarter went to a rate of 5.7%.",
        "This last figure represents a jump with respect to the figure registered in the third quarter (4.0%).",
        "Furthermore, in December, the sales balance from the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) also suggests that the expansion of household domestic consumption in the fourth quarter will have occurred at a rate similar to what was registered in the third.Respecting investment other than investing in the construction of buildings and public works, both the balance of the EMEE investment expectations and the growth in imports of capital goods in real terms indicate a better performance than what was registered in the third quarter of 2013.",
        "In the first case, there is a recovery in terms of the balance sheet with respect to that registered in the third quarter.",
        "In the second, expansion in the fourth quarter was 8.5%, which was well above the 2.1% average registered in the third quarter.Regarding foreign trade, total exports in dollars rose 6.5% in December due to the combined increase from mining (3.6%), agriculture (18.4%), and the remaining exports (5.5%).",
        "The increase in mining exports resulted from higher foreign sales of coal (36.2%) and crude oil (7.2%).",
        "In the case of agriculture, growth in coffee (16.9%), bananas (21.3%), and flowers (18.6%) was registered.",
        "Exports of industrial goods and others also rose 5.5% largely due to the growth in the area of food and beverages, vehicles and automotive parts, and chemical products that offset the drop in clothing, machinery, and electrical appliances.Total exports in dollars for all of 2013 fell 2.2% with respect to the year before.",
        "This drop, which was mainly associated with lower prices, was due to the lower sales of mining (-3.6%) and agricultural (-0.5%) products.",
        "With respect to exports of industrial goods and others, there was a rise of 2.2%.In December, total imports in dollars, in turn, registered a growth of 8.6% in comparison to the same month the year before.",
        "This performance is basically explained by the larger purchases of capital goods (23%) linked to a rise in rolling stock.",
        "Imports of raw materials grew 1.2% and those for consumption showed a fall of 1%.Throughout 2013, the total value of imports in dollars grew 0.5% compared to the previous year.",
        "This performance was due to the higher imports of consumer goods (1.5%) and raw materials (0.5%) and partly offset by the declines in the purchases of capital goods (-0.1%).",
        "In general, the low growth in imports was associated with lower prices.With respect to supply, the industrial production index (IPI) excluding coffee threshing as measured by DANE grew 1.5% in December.",
        "In quarterly terms, the drop in the IPI excluding coffee threshing (-0.3%) during the October-December period in 2013 was offset by significant growth in coffee threshing (55%).",
        "As a result, the industry overall grew 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2013 which implies a recovery after the negative record of 1.0% in the previous quarter.Based on information from November regarding construction, licensing continued reporting an important performance as it grew 21.7%.",
        "The 12-month aggregate figure showed an expansion of 15%.",
        "Based on information from December, production and dispatch of cement grew 7.3% and 8.9% respectively thus conserving levels that are quite favorable and historically high.",
        "In comparison to the previous quarter, both the production (which went from 6.0% to 11.7%) and dispatches (they went from 7.1% to 9.9%) surged.",
        "The performance of said indicators suggests that the strength of the sector has continued.The above makes it possible to have a forecast range for the growth of the GDP between 4.0% and 5.0% in the fourth quarter with 4.6% being the most probable figure.",
        "Household consumption will have grown at rates similar to its historical average.",
        "Investment will have risen the most.",
        "Exports will have surged but less strongly than imports.",
        "With respect to supply, the greatest growth will be seen in construction (buildings and public works) and agriculture.",
        "The mining sector will have slowed down and growth of industry (which includes coffee threshing) will have been almost zero.",
        "With this information, we calculate that the Colombian economy grew between 3.7% and 4.3% in 2013 with 4.1% as the most probable percentage.Information for 2014 is still very scarce and preliminary.",
        "In the area of demand, the consumer confidence index (CCI) published by Fedesarrollo, which is highly correlated to private consumption rallied in January with respect to the levels from the previous quarter and was above its average for all of 2013.",
        "The expectations component continues to show significant strength which may indicate a favorable performance for this area in the future.For indicators in the area of supply, the Fedesarrollo opinion survey of business owners shows that the sales order indicator maintained its level in January and its trend continued rising but at a slower pace.",
        "The inventory indicator improved with respect to the previous month.",
        "Last of all, expectations for production in three months rose significantly and the trend showed a positive slope.",
        "As a result, industrialist confidence has improved in comparison to the two previous months.In the case of commerce, the Fedesarrollo survey arrived at results for the current perception of sales that were quite positive.",
        "In it, the trend of the series showed a positive slope that would indicate that the performance of sales would continue to show the strength registered in the last few months.",
        "The outlook at six months, in turn, not show significant changes and stayed at levels similar to those from the last two months.",
        "In spite of that, the current values are relatively high compared to the historical average for the series.Other indicators with information as of January available are: i) the total demand for electricity, which rose 2.9% annually, expanded at every level and its trend shows a positive slope; ii) petroleum production was one million fourteen thousand barrels daily on average which, although it shows a low growth of 0.3%, implies an increase compared to the last four months.Thus, for all of 2014 the growth forecast remains within a range of 3.3% to 5.3% with 4.3% being the most probable figure Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) registered an annual growth rate of 12.2% in January, which is similar to the level seen the previous month.",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency went up slightly from 12.9% in December to 13.0% in January while the one in foreign currency slowed down as it went from an annual growth rate of 1.5% to 0.4%.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households had an annual growth of 13.5% in January, slightly higher than what was registered in the previous month (13.2%).",
        "This was due to the performance of consumer loans, which increased marginally between December and January (from 11.95% to 12.05%).",
        "In the case of mortgages, the growth rate registered an uptick as it went from growing at a rate of 15.37% to 15.59% during the same period.",
        "Regarding the commercial loan portfolio, the annual growth rate in January (11.51%) was similar to the one in the previous month (11.55%).",
        "This was due to the upsurge in the national currency component (from 12.76% in December to 12.92% in January) and the slowdown in the foreign currency component (from 1.30% to -0.04%).The interest rates for the loans disbursed by credit establishments since the beginning of the cuts in the benchmark rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of -213 bp for mortgages, -144 bp for consumer loans, and -236 bp for construction loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower inflation rate.",
        "There have been reductions during the same period of: -182 bp for mortgage loans, -114 bp for consumer loans, and -205 bp for construction loans.The levels of real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit as well as loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign ContextBased on the figures for the fourth quarter, the GDP of the major developed economies continued to expand at a modest pace though with a slight uptick in the case of the Euro zone and the United Kingdom.",
        "The growth in some emerging economies, in turn, slowed down with respect to what was registered in 2012.In the United States, preliminary data for the fourth quarter of 2013 show positive growth led by private consumption and exports.",
        "However, the initial figures disclosed for productive activity (industries and retail sales) in January 2014 revealed a slowdown in the rate of annual expansion and registered monthly declines.",
        "It is noteworthy that these figures may be affected by the severe winter season early in the year and, therefore, the activity could be expected to spike in the coming months.",
        "For example, preliminary data for manufacturing suggest somewhat of a recovery in February.",
        "In this context, several analysts have lowered their growth forecast for the first quarter but have left their forecast for all of 2014 unchanged.In the euro zone, there was an upswing in growth during the fourth quarter because of the better performance in Germany and France and the end of the recession in some economies on the periphery.",
        "The figures for January show that consumer confidence continued to recover while, in the case of businessmen, confidence remained at a favorable level.",
        "Likewise, the indicators of business perception in the sectors of manufacturing and services remained in expansionary territory.",
        "With respect to the emerging economies in Latin America, the data as of December 2013 show that productive activity continued to slow down in Brazil and Chile while it was stable in Peru, and registered a slight increase in Mexico.",
        "Partial information for the beginning of the year shows some deterioration in the confidence of the agents in several of the economies in the region.In China, the manufacturing activity continued to slow down in January while exports, in contrast, registered an upswing.With regard to the international prices of commodities exported by Colombia, the prices for petroleum (benchmark Brent), coal, and nickel have remained relatively stable in recent weeks.",
        "The price of coffee, in turn, has risen due to the drought in Brazil.",
        "The adverse weather conditions in this country have also affected the prices of other food items such as soybeans.In the case of inflation, the price fluctuations in the main developed economies in January remained below the long term targets set by their central banks.",
        "In Japan, the upward trend registered since last year has continued.Given this situation and with output gaps that are still largely negative, the major central banks maintained their policies of monetary stimulus.",
        "However, another cut in monthly purchases of assets beginning in February was announced in the United States.",
        "In addition, based on the most recent minutes of the FED meetings, some members have begun to think that the increase in the benchmark interest rate could take place even before -2015 if the economic conditions continue to follow expectations.Regarding the emerging economies, the inflation outlook is still varied with some recovery in Latin America and inflation that remains high in some countries in the region (Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela) and of Asia.In relation to the financial markets, an increase in global uncertainty, particularly in some emerging economies, was observed in January.",
        "The ongoing tapering off of the stimulus program in the U and the reduction in the growth projections in emerging countries as well as some political events that have occurred in them have increased the perception of risk for these economies.",
        "As a result, their currencies have depreciated and their stock markets underwent devaluations.",
        "The situation has shown a tendency to return to normal conditions in recent weeks.",
        "It is worth noting that the countries most affected by global uncertainty were those with greater external vulnerabilities and fewer possibilities for implementing stimulus policies.In summary, the outlook for global growth in 2014 remains largely unchanged.",
        "Worldwide growth is projected to be just over half a percentage point higher in 2014 than what was registered in 2013.",
        "In 2014, the average growth for Colombia's trading partners will be above that recorded in 2013 AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) There are no major changes in the outlook for worldwide growth in 2014 with respect to the ones described in the recently published Inflation Report.",
        "Worldwide growth in 2014 is projected to surpass that of 2013 by a little more than half a percentage point.",
        "The gradual recovery of the advanced economies continues and the new data from emerging countries has confirmed the expected slowdown in their growth rate.",
        "For 2014, the average growth for Colombia’s trading partners will be above that registered in 2013.",
        "(ii) Foreign interest rates and the price of the dollar are surpassing the averages seen in 2013.",
        "It is likely that a significant part of these increases will be permanent to the degree that they are due to less expansionary global levels of liquidity.",
        "(iii) The international price for petroleum remains at high levels and the price for Colombian coffee has surpassed the average registered for 2013.",
        "The prices for coal and nickel stopped falling.",
        "Therefore, it is likely that the terms of trade will remain at favorable levels.",
        "(iv) The technical team predicts that economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2013 will be between 4% and 5% with 4.6% being the most probable percentage.",
        "Household consumption will have grown at rates similar to its historical average.",
        "Investment will have shown the highest rise.",
        "Exports will have surged but not as strongly as imports.",
        "In the area of supply, construction (buildings and public works) and agriculture will have presented the most growth.",
        "The mining sector will have slowed down and growth of industry (which includes coffee bean threshing) will have been almost zero.",

        "The nominal interest rates for loans increased, but in real terms, they remained stable and are at levels that drive economic growth.",
        "(vii) Annual inflation in January was 2.13% and thus within the target range.",
        "Furthermore, the average of the core inflation measurements was 2.55%.",
        "The inflation expectations of economic analysts for a year from now as well as those derived from public debt paper with maturities of less than five years are around 3%.The members of the Board of Directors emphasized that the information available on the internal variables of demand, confidence, output growth, loans, and inflation indicates that the output gap and the current deviation of actual inflation from the target (inflation gap) have been closing and this is expected to continue over the course of the year.They reiterated the uncertainty about the effect that the gradual normalization of monetary policy by the United States Federal Reserve could have on the Colombian economy through contagion from emerging countries that are more vulnerable.",
        "They also highlighted other risks, especially those from the situation in Venezuela; the slow down in the growth of economic activity in China and the recent performance of some indicators associated with the rate of expansion of the North American economy.",
        "They also commented that in spite of the fact that inflation for food continues to remain very low compared to historical records, this behavior is partly due to transitory factors and could reverse itself if the trend in the international prices for food changes.To the Board of Directors, the forecast of a gradual convergence of inflation towards its target and of output towards its potential value together with the risks noted above suggested that it would be prudent to maintain the current expansionary monetary policy posture DECISIONThe Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",

        "Recent Developments in InflationIn December, annual consumer inflation (1.94%) registered a surge of 18 basis points (bp) compared to what was registered in November.",
        "This rise was concentrated in the regulated and food indices.",
        "Based on this, consumer inflation in 2013 was 50 bp less than it had been in 2012.In the basket for food, the annual variation was 0.86% at the end of the month or 24 bp higher than in November.",
        "In terms of annual changes, the surge was concentrated in staples (from -2.09% to -0.16%).",
        "Likewise, there was a moderate surge in meals away from home (from 3.08% to 3.26%) in December while in processed foods there was a slight slowdown with respect to the previous month (from -0.10% to -0.24%).The annual change in the CPI excluding food was at 2.36% in December, 15 bp more than it had been the previous month.",
        "The 60 bp rise in the annual variation of the CPI for regulated items (1.05% annually) which is mainly attributable to public utilities (electricity fees) is noteworthy.",
        "The changes that occurred in the annual variation were lower for the other items in the sub-basket.",
        "Fuel ended the year in negative territory (-3.2%).The other CPI sub-baskets excluding food, tradables and non-tradables not show significant changes.",
        "In the first case, the annual variation for December stayed at the same level as the previous month (1.4%).",
        "The prices for this basket have been rising from very low levels over the course of the year in the wake of the depreciation in the exchange rate.",
        "Furthermore, the non-tradables showed an annual change of 3.76%, which is 3 bp above the prior figure.",
        "The change in the prices for this basket has remained stable over the last few months which suggests that the pressures from demand continue to be moderate.The average of the four indicators of core inflation monitored by the Banco de la Republica was 2.51% in December, 5 bp higher than the previous month.",
        "This measurement has shown few changes since the decline at the beginning of the year and has fluctuated around 2.5%.The annual change in the PPI went from -1.3 % in November to -0.5% in December.",
        "Both the local and imported components rose with respect to last month.",
        "(In the first case, the rise was 90 bp while in the second, it was 55 bp.",
        ")Inflation expectations for different horizons not show significant changes during the last month.",
        "According to the Banco de la Republica’s monthly survey of financial market analysts, the inflation expected for 12 months from now is 2.85%.",
        "This is only 4 bp lower than the result last month.",
        "In the same survey, the inflation expected for December 2014 is 2.80%.",
        "The Bank’s quarterly survey of businessmen, in turn, shows that their inflation expectations for 12 months from now are 2.7%, which is a little less than the result from October (2.9%).",
        "Finally, inflation expectations derived from the TES curve for 2-, 3-, and 5-year maturities have risen slightly since January to converge at 3.0% GrowthThe indicators available for the last quarter of 2013 suggest that the GDP expanded at a rate that was below the rate registered for the third quarter.",
        "Nonetheless, this is expected to be above the average for the first half of the year.Private consumption is expected to have grown at a rate similar to that for the previous quarter.",
        "This conclusion is the result of the performance of retail sales from the Monthly Retail Sample ( in Spanish), which shows that they grew 5.3% annually in November (5.9% for the October-November two-month period).",
        "This figure is higher than what was registered for the third quarter (4.9%).",
        "When the segment of vehicle and car sales is discounted, the retail sales grew 8.7% (6.7% in the two-month period).",
        "This indicates a surge with respect to what was registered for the third quarter (4.0%).",
        "In line with the abovementioned, the balance of sales in the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) shows that the merchants saw a slightly better demand in October and November than was seen in the third quarter.",
        "The consumer confidence index for December, in turn, not show significant changes with respect to the levels in November and October.",
        "Likewise, the positive performance in the labor market as well as the stability in the growth rate of the household portfolio indicate that household consumption is maintaining the strength seen in the third quarter.Regarding investment, according to the balance of investment expectations in the Banco de la Republica’s Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations (EMEE in Spanish) gross capital formation excluding investment in public works and construction would have grown at rates that were significant and higher in the fourth quarter than those seen in the third quarter.",
        "In real terms, the figures on imports of capital goods for industry confirm this.",
        "Investment in transportation equipment would have continued falling in annual terms although at a lower rate.",
        "It can be assumed that investment in public works will remain at the high levels seen in the third quarter.",
        "The same can be expected for investment in construction.In the area of foreign trade, the annual change in total exports was 2.6% in November.",
        "This growth is the result of higher exports of mining (5.5%) and agricultural (1%) products.",
        "The rise in mining exports is due to the increase in foreign sales of crude oil (15.9%) and derivatives (15.2%).",
        "For agricultural products, growth was registered only for coffee (21.1%).",
        "Exports of industrial goods and others declined 6.1% to a large degree because of the drops in the areas of the remaining industrial goods (-27.9%), the remaining agricultural products (-56%), and vehicles (-19.6%).Total imports, in turn, registered a decline of 1.8% in November in comparison to the same month the year before.",
        "This performance is due to the decline in imports of capital goods (-6.8%) and consumer goods (-3%) and is partly offset by the rise in imports of raw materials (3.3%).With respect to supply, the indicators available for industry show that the stagnation of the sector has not been overcome yet.",
        "The annual change in the IPI excluding coffee threshing was -0.6% for November.",
        "The trend leveled out again.",
        "Moreover, according to Fedesarrollo, industrial confidence declined in November.",
        "The purchase indicator registered a drop while the inventory indicator (counter-cyclical to production) not report changes.",
        "However, in this case, the trend continues to show a favorable performance for the two variables.",
        "The expectations with respect to production in three months, in turn, declined significantly.",
        "In contrast, the demand for non-regulated industrial electricity, which has a high correlation with the IPI, grew at an annual rate of 6.4% in December.In the case of commerce, businessmen pointed to some improvements in their perception of both their current and future business situation in the Fedesarrollo survey for November.Some of the figures associated with mining, specifically with petroleum, continued to show growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 although at a lower rate in comparison to the third.",
        "According to the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH in Spanish) petroleum production in December was at one million fourteen thousand barrels daily.",
        "During the fourth quarter, a million four thousand barrels were pumped daily on average.",
        "Based on this, there was a drop (from 8.8% in the third quarter to 3.3%).All of the above makes it possible to fix the forecast range for the annual growth of the GDP in the fourth quarter at 4.0% to 5.0% with 4.5% as the most probable rate.",
        "Thus, the forecast range for the growth of the economy in 2013 would be between 3.7% and 4.3%.",
        "Note that the performance of investment in public works, construction, and public consumption is a source of great uncertainty for these projections.",
        "The situation for 2014 is still uncertain but the GDP is expected to expand at rates similar to those registered for all of 2013.",
        "Among the factors that would maintain the strength of the growth in Colombia are: i) a more dynamic foreign demand and stronger trading partners, ii) a flow of FDI that continues to be favorable, iii) a monetary policy that continues to have an expansionary effect on productive activity, iv) low inflation that would favor the purchasing power of household income and, v) a labor market that continues to show significant strength.",
        "Favorable levels in the terms of trade are also expected although lower than the ones seen in 2013.",
        "With respect to investment in public works and building construction, less expansion than what occurred last year is expected but it should still be significant.The above makes it possible to fix forecast range for the expansion of the GDP in 2014 at 3.3% to 5.3% with the most probable figure being 4.3% Financial VariablesBank loans (N/ and F/C) registered an annual growth rate of 12.19% in December, a level which is lower than the one seen the previous month (13.30%).",
        "The loan portfolio in national currency dropped from 13.48% in November to 12.91% in December and the one in foreign currency also went from 11.10% to 1.65%.Broken down by market, the portfolio of loans granted to households registered an annual growth of 13.16% in December, which is slightly lower than the growth in the previous month (13.51%).",
        "This was due to the performance of consumer loans which declined between November and December going from 12.45% to 11.95%.",
        "Loans for the purchase of housing, in turn, climbed slightly as they went from growing at an annual rate of 14.80% to one of 15.37% during the same period.",
        "Regarding the commercial portfolio, the annual growth rate in December (11.55%) was lower than it was the month before (13.32%) due to the moderation in the national currency component (from 13.65% in November to 12.76% in December) and the slowdown in the foreign currency component (from 10.16% to 1.30%).",
        "The interest rates for loans disbursed by credit institutions since the beginning of the cuts in the policy interest rate in July 2012 have accumulated reductions of: -226 bp for mortgages, -203 bp for consumer loans, and -215 bp for building loans.The size of the decline in the real interest rates has been lower due to the effect of the lower rate of inflation.",
        "There have been reductions during this same period of: -181 bp for mortgages, -156 bp for consumer loans, and -170 bp for construction loans.The levels of the real interest rates for consumer loans, mortgages, preferential loans, ordinary commercial ones and commercial lines of credit, and loans for construction in September were below their historical averages as calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the credit card loans are above their average Foreign ContextIn the fourth quarter of 2013, global economic activity continued its recovery due to the greater strength of the developed economies with the United States leading it.",
        "The growth of the large emerging economies in Asia and Latin America was varied with rates that were close to or lower than their potential.",
        "During the same period the indices for manufacturing and trade on the global level showed a favorable performance.In the United States, consumer confidence has recovered after the drops produced by the fiscal uncertainty from previous months.",
        "Likewise, based on information as of December, the indicators for industry and retail sales showed favorable performance.",
        "With respect to the labor market, the unemployment rate continued to fall, but the rate of job creation has slowed down.",
        "This leads us to assume that the rate of participation has also declined.",
        "The indicators for the housing market showed evidence of better performance in the last few months since the slowdown seen in the third quarter.",
        "Regarding fiscal policy, important agreements were reached on the fiscal front in the last two months that reduced the uncertainty in the medium term as well as part of the impact of the contraction caused by the adjustment in public finances.",
        "In the next few weeks, the government’s debt limit should be discussed in Congress again.",
        "However, the negotiation is expected to be carried out this time with fewer stumbling blocks than were seen in previous episodes and, therefore, it should not affect confidence significantly.In the euro zone, in turn, the figures on productive activity for the fourth quarter show that the recovery would have been maintained in the last few weeks of the year.",
        "Thus, the retail sales and industry rallied slightly in the last few months.",
        "Likewise, the indices of business opinion in the manufacturing and service sectors remained in positive territory while business and consumer confidence showed favorable signs.",
        "In spite of the encouraging signs in the European economy, it is important to note that the region is still vulnerable to the degree that the unemployment rate stays at historical maximums (especially in the economies on the periphery), the financial markets are still fragmented, and credit continues to shrink (although at a lower rate).With respect to emerging economies, growth in China surged in the second half of the year because of the higher investment.",
        "This economy had a growth rate of 7.7% in 2013 (the same as the rate in 2012).",
        "In the case of Latin American countries, the figures for the fourth quarter show evidence of productive activity weakening in Brazil and Chile while Peru maintained its rate of growth.",
        "In the case of Mexico, there was a little recovery.In regards to the international prices for commodities exported by Colombia, the international prices for petroleum, coal, and nickel remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter while the prices for coffee continued to show a declining trend.",
        "The prices for food not present significant changes in the last few months of the year and stayed at levels that were lower than those seen in 2012.",
        "In this context, the country’s terms of trade remained below the levels that were reached in 2011 and 2012.With respect to inflation, the change in the general level of prices in the main developed economies was below the long term targets fixed by their central banks.",
        "In the specific case of the euro zone, total and core inflation have been declining for several quarters and, in December, they were below 1%.",
        "In contrast, prices continued to rise in Japan.",
        "In the emerging economies, the inflationary panorama remains unequal.",
        "Thus, while in countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Peru inflation was relatively low, other economies such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia continued to undergo upward pressure.In the fourth quarter of the year, the perception of risk in Latin American economies remained relatively stable although it was at a higher level than was seen in the first half of the year.",
        "One exception was Brazil where the economic weakness and the fall in confidence affected the growth expectations for the next few quarters.",
        "As a result, there was a larger rise in the risk premiums.Nevertheless, last week there was a marked depreciation of the currencies in the emerging economies with respect to the dollar and devaluations in their stock markets and public debt.",
        "The continuation of the tapering off of the monetary stimulus on the part of the FED at a time when the outlook for growth is evidently lower in some economies seems to be the cause for the rise in the risk perception.",
        "The pressures have been greater in those countries with weaker growth fundamentals: high inflation, large deficits in the current account, decreasing international reserves, and a high dependence on short term capital flows.",
        "In this context, some central banks such as those in Brazil, Turkey, India, and South Africa raised their interest rates in order to alleviate exchange rate pressures AND OPTIONSThe board of directors took the following relevant aspects into consideration:(i) In the fourth quarter of 2013, worldwide economic activity continued to recover due to the greater strength of the developed economies, especially the United States.",
        "In the euro zone, the economic indicators suggest a low but positive quarterly growth.",
        "The growth of the large emerging economies in Asia and Latin America was diverse with rates that were close to or lower than their potential.",
        "For 2014, the estimates suggest that the global recovery will continue and that the country’s trading partners will have an average growth that is above what was registered in 2013.",
        "(ii) The US Federal Reserve announced that they will again reduce the amount of financial assets purchased in February and ratified their commitment to maintain the current interest rate level for a prolonged period.",
        "Thus, to the degree that the levels of liquidity remain less expansionary, the cost of international financing could rise.",
        "(iii) The improvement in the outlook for the US economy and its implications for the monetary policy in that country are affecting the bond, stock, and monetary markets.",
        "The Colombian peso has devalued with respect to the dollar.",
        "The international price for petroleum remains at high levels, in turn, and the prices for coal, nickel, and coffee stopped falling.",
        "Based on this, it is probable that the terms of trade will stay at favorable levels.",
        "(iv) The technical team has projected an economic growth of 4% to 5% for the fourth quarter of 2013 with 4.5% being the most probable figure.",
        "Household consumption will have grown at rates that are similar to its historical average.",
        "Investment will have shown the greatest rise.",
        "Exports will have surged but less than imports.",
        "Respecting supply, most of the growth will have been in construction (buildings and public works) and agriculture.",
        "The mining sector will have slowed down and industrial growth (including coffee threshing) will have been almost zero.",
        "Based on this information, the Colombian economy is calculated to have grown between 3.7% and 4.3% in 2013.",
        "(v) An economic growth that is between 3.3% and 5.3% is predicted for 2014 with 4.3% as the most probable figure.",
        "(vi)  In December, overall growth of loans slowed down although it remains higher than the rise in the nominal GDP.",
        "The nominal interest rates for loans declined and the ones for consumer loans and mortgages remained relatively stable.",
        "In real terms, they are staying below their historical averages (except for credit card rates) and are driving economic growth.",
        "(vii) Annual inflation in December was 1.94%, a figure that is similar to what was projected and below the lower limit of the target range established for 2013 (3% +/- 1 pp.).",
        "The average for core inflation measurements was at 2.5% and the inflation expectations of economic analysts for a year from now as well as those derived from public debt paper with maturities of less than five years are close to 3%.The members of the Board of Directors thought that there were clear indications that the output gap and the current variance of inflation with respect to the target (inflation gap) will close over the course of 2014.",
        "Regarding the magnitude, the velocity at which these gaps will close, and their relationship with the current inflation gap, differences between the members of the Board persist.Likewise, the existing uncertainty about the effect that the normalization of monetary policy in the United States could have on the Colombian economy directly or through its impact on other emerging economies was emphasized.Finally, the Board stressed that the monetary policy framework which consists of inflation targeting and a floating exchange rate to confront external shocks has functioned well.",
        "Thus, the gap between observed inflation and the Bank’s target, the weak pass through of nominal depreciation to the level of consumer prices, and a low level of unhedged foreign exchange positions in the economy make it possible for the exchange rate to absorb the effects of the international situation without generating trauma in the Colombian economy and without putting compliance with the inflation target at risk DECISIONThe Board of Directors agreed unanimously that it would be appropriate to keep the benchmark interest rate at 3.25%.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",

        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on September 26, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of how Banco de la República’s technical team views the macroeconomic situation (Section 1), followed by a review of the key policy discussion points considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2).A moredetailed description of the macroeconomic situation, prepared by Banco de la República’s technical team, is provided in the data section of the June 2014 edition of the Inflation Report and in the statistical appendix THE CONTEXTThe technical team underscores the following aspects with respect to the macroeconomic context:The new figures on global economic activity suggest Colombia’s trading partners could average somewhat less growth in 2014 than was estimated for the central forecast in the last quarterly report (2.5%).",
        "This would be due to the loss of momentum in the euro area and a more pronounced slowdown in China and some countries in the region.",
        "In contrast, the United States economy has performed a bit better than estimated.",
        "Consequently, the recovery in the external demand for Colombian products is likely to be slower during the second half of the year than was predicted in previous reports.The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to end its financial asset buying program in October 2014.",
        "The first benchmark interest rate hike by the Fed continues to be forecast for -2015, but with somewhat faster adjustments than those anticipated in recent months.",
        "Given this scenario, long-term interest rates on United States treasuries ceased to decline in recent weeks and were situated above the average observed in 2013.A number of countries in the region have seen their risk premiums increase in the last few weeks; nevertheless, they are still low and below the average for 2013. International oil prices declined, as prices for some of the commodities exported by Colombia.",
        "Preliminary estimates indicate the deterioration in terms of trade could be more than was estimated in the last quarterly report.The value of exports in dollars recovered during July and exceeded the average for the first half of the year.",
        "The recovery was more pronounced in exports of mining and agricultural products.",
        "The value of total exports in dollars accumulated a reduction of 2.6% in the first seven months of the year (it was -4.5% in the first six months).Imports in dollars accelerated.",
        "In July, they posted the highest monthly value on record.",
        "The largest annual increase was in imports of capital goods, mainly due to aircraft purchases.",
        "Imports of consumer and intermediate goods also registered considerable growth.",
        "Total imports rose 8.1% in the amount accumulated between January and July; this is two percentage points more than during the first half of the year.The aforementioned trends in foreign trade increased the likelihood of a negative trade balance throughout 2014 and a larger current account deficit than in 2013.",
        "The supply shock caused by temporary closure of the Cartagena refinery explains part of the increase in this deficit.In the domestic context, economic growth during the second quarter of 2014 (4.3%) was in line with the forecasts.",
        "Domestic demand and its main components (consumption and investment) lost some momentum, but continued to register higher increases than those in total GDP.",
        "Exports dropped and imports slowed.",
        "On the supply side, the most dynamic economic sector was works, followed by financial, real estate and business services, and social, community and personal services.",
        "In addition to mining, the other sector that declined was industry, partly because of temporary closure of the Cartagena refinery.For the third quarter, the new figures on economic activity suggest growth during this period could be somewhat higher than in the second quarter.",
        "This is apparent in the performance of retail sales, industrial production, building permits and cement production up to July, and in the figures for coffee and energy demand up to August.",
        "However, oil production continued to contract in July-August.The increase in bank loans in domestic currency continued to trend downward in August and during the course of September to date.",
        "This slowdown is explained by the reduced momentum in commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, in home mortgages.",
        "Consumer loans continued to grow at a stable pace.",
        "The annual increase in all types of lending was higher than nominal GDP growth estimated for the current year.The pass-through of benchmark interest rate hikes to interest rates on loans deteriorated in August.",
        "Some indicators suggest this is due to a larger supply of credit.",
        "In real terms, all interest rates on loans (except credit cards) are below the average calculated since 2000.Given all of the above, the technical team continues to forecast growth between 4.2% and 5.8% in 2014, with 5% being the most likely rate.",
        "This last figure implies somewhat less of an increase in GDP during the second half of the year than in the first six months.Annual inflation rose in August and was 3.02%, which is consistent with the technical team’s estimate.",
        "Larger adjustments in prices for food, regulated items and non-tradables excluding food and regulated items explained this behavior.",
        "The average of the various measurements of core inflation began to converge towards the target, once again,  and was 2.7%Analysts’ expectations for inflation one year ahead and the expectations derived from government bonds at two, three and five years, remain near or slightly above the long-term target (3%).In short, aggregate demand continues to exhibit strong growth in a context of nearly full use of productive capacity.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations remain at around 3%.",
        "This is occurring in an environment where terms of trade are deteriorating and there is added uncertainty about the recovery in global economic activity and the cost of external financing.",
        "These factors can influence aggregate demand, as well as the exchange rate AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, to keep the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Some members of the Board agree with the main elements of the short- and medium-term diagnosis outlined in the document prepared by the technical team.",
        "The relevant considerations in the traditional horizon for inflation targeting (one to two years) include the existence of a slightly positive output gap, domestic demand that is growing at high rates and more than expected, inflation that will be slightly above 3% in the coming months, but inflation expectations that so far show signs of being anchored to the 3% target, and a policy interest rate that implies a slightly expansionary monetary stance.",
        "However, insofar as monetary policy acts with a lag, it is important to consider the risks that could affect confidence and the future performance of the real economy, particularly those inherent in the international environment and in fiscal policy.",
        "To that extent, they considered it prudent to leave the benchmark rate at 4.5% for now and emphasized the importance of further evaluating the performance of the economy at the next meeting in order to define the future of monetary policy.Other members of the Board argued that the latest information on second-quarter GDP growth on the domestic-demand side indicates a slowdown, despite its continued momentum, mainly due to works.",
        "However, given the lag between movement in the policy interest rate and its full effect on demand, the greatest impact will not be felt before the second half of 2015 and first half of 2016.",
        "On the other hand, the boost from performance in the mining-energy sector has slowed, as has the downward trend in terms of trade.",
        "Added to this is the weakness in the external sector, particularly with respect to Colombia’s neighbors in the region.",
        "Lastly, total inflation and inflation expectations are anchored to the target, which is the main objective of monetary policy, while the average of the core indicators, such as non-food inflation, is still below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "According, they believe the benchmark rate should be kept at 4.5%.Another member of the Board felt that, given a positive output gap and inflation that continues to rise in terms of its expectations, it makes sense to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bps to 4.75%, considering the data on growth in domestic demand during the second quarter, the relevant job market figures, and the business and consumer confidence indicators DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, to keep the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Bogotá,",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on May 30, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.A synthesis is presented below of the view held by the Banco de la República’s technical team with respect to the macroeconomic situation (section 1) and, afterwards, the main discussion points regarding policy considered by the Board of Directors are summed up (section 2)A more detailed explanation of the macroeconomic situation written bythe technical team at the Banco de la Repúblicais presented in the data section of the April 2014 Inflation Report and in thestatistics appendix1.",
        "CONTEXTWith respect to the quarterlyinflation report published in March 2014and considering the information available on the date of the meeting, the technical team has found no significant changes in the macroeconomic context:The following items, in particular, are emphasized: The official growth in the United States for the first quarter was revised downward.",
        "This drop in economic activity, which was attributed to the effects of the severe winter, could mean a lower market forecast for the entire year.",
        "In spite of that, the downward revisions will probably not be significant since the more recent favorable performance suggests that the first quarter shock was transitory.",
        "The main emerging countries, in turn, have slowed down but continue to show moderate growth.",
        "In this context, the DPI estimates an average growth in 2014 for Colombia’s trading partners that is similar to what was registered in 2013.",
        "The FED reduced their purchases of financial assets again.",
        "The foreign interest rates declined and the market is expecting that the first increase in the FED benchmark interest rate will occur in the second half of 2015.",
        "In the euro zone, the ECB is thinking of implementing new monetary stimulus measures.",
        "In May, the measurements of global risk aversion and the risk premiums for the main countries in the region decreased slightly and remain below the averages seen so far this year and in 2013.",
        "In the first three months of 2014, the prices for exports declined more than the ones for imports and, because of that, the terms of trade (TT) deteriorated.",
        "Between February and March, the TT recovered due to the better prices for coffee and nickel.",
        "It is estimated that the average TT for all of 2014 will be lower than the average seen in 2013, but their level will continue to be favorable The deterioration in the TT contributed to a foreign trade deficit being registered in the first quarter of 2014.",
        "So far this year and in annual terms, exports dropped due to the fall in foreign sales of mining and industrial products (agricultural sales increased).",
        "During the same period, imports rose because of the higher international purchases of raw materials.",
        "The value of the consumer imports was similar to what it was a year ago while the value of capital goods fell.",
        "With all of that, the probability rose that an increase in the current account deficit would be registered this year.",
        "The new figures for retail trade during the first quarter of the year and the Bank’s economic expectations ratify the positive performance projected for household expenditures, especially in durable goods.",
        "With respect to supply, when corrected for working days, the industrial numbers indicate low growth for the sector which is similar to what was estimated.",
        "In April, consumer confidence remained at levels that are above their historical average.",
        "According to the Fedesarrollo survey, the confidence of industrial and commercial businesses continued its upward trend (seasonally adjusted series).",
        "In the same month, vehicle sales declined, but their trend component started to grow again.",
        "Nonetheless, it is necessary to be aware that the figures for the second quarter will be affected by the lower number of working days and, therefore, the performance of the economy during this period, may be lower than it was in the first.",
        "In April, bank loans again presented higher rates of growth as a consequence of the better performance of commercial loans (in pesos) and mortgages and due to a consumer loan portfolio that stopped dropping.",
        "The real interest rates for the different types of loans began to decline again due to the increase in inflation excluding food.",
        "With all of the above, the most probable projected growth for the first three months of 2014 (4.8%) not change in comparison to the estimate in the last report.",
        "Thus, the estimates suggest that the output gap in 2014 will be negative but close to zero and that, in 2015, it will be above this value With respect to prices, inflation was 0.46% in April.",
        "This was higher than the average estimated by the market (0.32%) and the SGEE forecast.",
        "With that, annual inflation went to 2.72%.",
        "Likewise, the average for the four measurements of core inflation continued its growth trend and went to 2.75%.",
        "Just as it the month before, the annual change in the non-tradables dipped slightly while the other groups registered higher rates of growth.",
        "In view of these results, the analysts’ inflation expectations for a year from now climbed to 3.2%.",
        "The expectations that emerge from the public debt securities with 2, 3, and 5-year maturities have been volatile and are around 3%.",
        "Regarding costs, salaries in industry and commerce began to register higher rates of growth again in April with annual changes that are above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "This is in a context of an unemployment rate with a downward trend and that is at a level that is similar to the estimate.",
        "The cost of raw materials has surged for industry judging by the increase in the IPP (intermediate consumption: 4.8%).To summarize, for the technical team at the Banco de la Republica, the macroeconomic context is characterized by an output gap that is slightly negative, an inflation that is converging more rapidly towards the midpoint of the target range, analysts’ inflation expectations that rose and surpassed 3%, a new decline in the real interest rates from levels that are low compared to the historical average, and a surge in the growth of loansDISCUSSION AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board of Directors agreed that inflation expectations are anchored to the Bank’s medium term goal and, that even though the recent data on the observed inflation show a greater surge than expected, they are part of the process of convergence towards the goal.",
        "In addition, they mentioned that one part of this phenomenon was due to a correction in the reduction that the index for certain subbaskets had in 2013 and that, due to their nature, was transitory.Regarding the product, the members of the Board of Directors agreed that the economy will grow at least 4.3% in 2014.",
        "This is the main forecast of the technical team.",
        "There are some differences within the group over what the potential GDP growth, the aggregate demand, and the velocity of the closing of the output gap will be.",
        "Specifically, some members expect that the growth of both the potential and the observed GDP will be higher than what has been projected by the Bank’s technical team.Within the analysis that was carried out to determine the monetary policy posture, follow up on the financial variables was also done.",
        "In this case, several directors mentioned that the growth of household and business indebtedness and the change in the financial burden indicators represent an accumulation of risk on the balance sheets of economic agents.",
        "Special note was made of the fact that, currently, an increase in the benchmark interest rate is consistent with goal of reducing the stimulus to accumulate said risks.",
        "This is even more true if the fact that the real interest rate for the economy has been low for a lengthy period of time is taken into account.The members of the Board of Directors decided that, in the abovementioned context, it is desirable to continue the gradual rolling back of the monetary stimulus which implies an increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "This policy option encompasses the fact that both the output gap and inflation will be closing over the course of the year and counteracts the downward pressure that the rise in inflation will generate on the real interest rates.",
        "At the same time, it will contribute to moderating an excessive accumulation of risks in the balance sheets of the economyPOLICY DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided unanimously that it would be appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp and set it at 3.75%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on July 31, 2014.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Enrique Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of how Banco de la República’s technical team views the macroeconomic situation (Section 1), followed by a review of the key policy discussion points considered by the Board of Directors (Section 2).Amore detailed explanation of the macroeconomic situationprepared by Banco de la República’s technical team can be found in the data section of the June 2014 edition of the Inflation Report and in the statistical appendix THE CONTEXTThe technical team underscores the following aspects with respect to the macroeconomic context:The average growth forecast for Colombia’s major trading partners in all of 2014 was lowered in the June 2014  report, given the drop in output registered by the United States at the start of the year and the sharper than estimated slowdown in several countries in the region.",
        "Implicit in the new forecast is a more dynamic external demand during the second half of the year, since economic activity in the United States is expected to rebound.Long-term interest rates in the United States declined throughout the second quarter, but are still above the average observed in 2013.",
        "On average, the market expects the Federal Reserve (FED) to conclude its financial asset purchases in October 2014, and the first increase in its benchmark interest rate is anticipated for -2015.Certain risks associated with the momentum in the Chinese economy and other emerging countries persist in the global economy, as does the fear of deflation in the euro area.",
        "However, the latest figures on second-quarter growth in China and Spain were better than expected.Colombia’s risk measurements so far this year exhibit a downward trend.",
        "At the end of July, they were at low levels and below the average witnessed in 2013.",
        "Terms of trade have been relatively stable, at levels somewhat inferior to last year’s average.",
        "The second half of the year likely will see terms of trade that continue to be positive and help to keep national revenue at what can be considered historically high levelsIn April-May 2014, the dollar value of exports was less than it was a year earlier.",
        "The bulk of the decline was in mining exports, followed by industrial exports.",
        "Overseas sales of the country’s major agricultural products are extremely dynamic, bolstered by exports of coffee and bananas.",
        "As such, during the year to April, the cumulative decline in the dollar value of total exports came to 4.6%.In contrast, the dollar value of imports rose in annual terms in April, pulled up by foreign purchases for end and intermediate consumption and, to a lesser extent, by imports of capital goods.",
        "During the course of this year through April, total imports increased at a rate of 4.5% compared to the same period the year before.Given these trends in foreign trade, the trade balance for all of 2014 probably will be negative, and the current account deficit is likely to be higher than in 2013.As for the domestic context, the recovery in consumer confidence, the rise in consumer lending, the healthy growth in retail sales and constant improvements in the job market suggest real household spending during the second quarter should continue to expand at a good rate, although less so than earlier this year.",
        "Investment also is expected to increase at a slower pace, nearer to its historic growth rate.",
        "The foregoing is judging by the behavior of expectations for business investment (EMEE) and imports of capital goods, mainly those for transport.On the supply side, the second quarter is expected to see a considerable rise in investment in works and in the construction of buildings and structures, although less so than in the first quarter.",
        "No growth in industry is anticipated, partly because of a temporary supply shock in the petroleum derivatives sector and fewer business days in April (due to Easter Week)Bank deposits increased at less of an annual rate during the second quarter of 2014.",
        "The same period also saw lending institutions restructure the make-up of their assets in favor of the loan portfolio, mainly commercial lending.",
        "The sale of a portion of their investments (TES) to foreign agents was the main source of funding for credit growth.",
        "As a result, the bank loan portfolio in domestic currency accelerated and registers growth rates superior to the nominal increase in GDP estimated for this year.The increase in benchmark interest rates has passed through to interest rates on lending at a pace similar to that observed in the last ten years.In real terms, all interest rates on lending (except credit cards) are below the average calculated since 2000.Given all of the above, the technical team is forecasting annual growth between 3.6% and 5.0% for the second quarter of 2014, with 4.3% being the most likely figure.",
        "This would represent a slowdown with respect to the first quarter, partly because of fewer business days.",
        "If this forecast proves to be accurate, the pace of economic growth in the first half of 2014 would be similar to the rate on record for the second half of 2013.The technical team upwardly revised the range of its forecast for 2014 as a whole, placing it between 4.2% and 5.8%, with 5% being the most likely figure.Annual inflation in June was 2.79%, down from the rate in May and lower than the market’s average forecast and that of the technical team.",
        "This pause in the build-up in inflation came after six months of continuous growth and is explained primarily by food and non-tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "The average of the various measurements of core inflation behaved similarly and was 2.76%.Analysts’ one-year-ahead inflation expectations remain near or slightly above the long-term target (3%), as do those resulting from government bonds at two, three and five years.In summary, growth in aggregate demand in Colombia continues to be strong amid a context marked by nearly full use of productive capacity.",
        "The dynamic rate of growth in domestic spending is expected to persist, accompanied by a recovery in external demand.",
        "June saw a temporary pause in the build-up in inflation, but the short-term forecasts (STF) suggest it will be just over 3% by December.",
        "Inflation expectations are near or slightly above 3%.",
        "All of this is taking place in an environment where growth in lending has increased and real interest rates on loans are at levels conducive to spending AND OPTIONSAs for inflation, the Board members underscored the fact that expectations are near the target and are expected to continue with the same momentum.",
        "Some additional supply shocks are anticipated with respect to inflation, particularly in food and regulated items.",
        "These might influence specific data in the overall figure for inflation, but are not expected to contaminate general expectations, given their nature and transience.Most members of the Board believe the output gap has closed, due to the strong momentum in domestic demand and the growth in GDP.",
        "Moreover, not changing the interest rate could end up generating excess demand that would jeopardize the stability of growth and inflation.",
        "They also agreed there are risks of exogenous shocks to monetary policy associated with the behavior of external demand and the impact of fiscal policy on domestic demand, and emphasized that new information is particularly relevant to defining the need for subsequent movements in the rate.Another Board member stated that, although he believes the output gap has yet to close, the convergence of total inflation and inflation expectations towards the target and GDP growth towards its potential rate are clear and precisely what has been sought since the onset of the policy normalization cycle in April.",
        "Therefore, he does not consider it advisable to halt adjustment in the interest rate until it reaches its normalization range, when this cycle of adjustments should culminate, with the current level being very close to that point.One member of the Board believes that the economy is close to equilibrium and, given the risks of reduction in aggregate demand, raising the interest rate is not advisable.",
        "In fact, exogenous factors such as a decline in external confidence or a drop in commodity prices could slow the momentum exhibited by the economy during the first half of the year.",
        "Accordingly, a benchmark interest rate of 4% would be consistent with an economy growing at its potential rate, but with risks of a slowdown in the short term ON POLICYThe majority of the Board considered it appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.25%."

    "2022": [
        "This decision took into account the following considerations:Annual headline inflation rate remained high due to higher external pressures and to a more-dynamic-than-expected behavior of demand.",
        "Headline inflation stood at 9.23% in April and at 9.07% in May; inflation excluding food and regulated items surprised to the upside, reaching 5.26% in April and 5.87% in May.",
        "Market inflation expectations increased, and, according to the June survey to economic analysts, they stand at a median of 8.6% and 7.1% for headline and non-food inflation, respectively, for the end of 2022.",
        "In the policy horizon, they are significantly above the 3.0% target.GDP growth figures for the first quarter of 2022 were higher than expected, exhibiting an annual 8.2% change compared to the 7.2% figure expected by the technical staff.",
        "This dynamism responds to the strengthening of domestic demand driven by household consumption, which expanded by 12.0% annually for that period.",
        "The consumer portfolio grew 22.1% annually in -June.",
        "The economic tracking indicator (ISE) exhibited an annual 11.8% change in April, which was higher than expected (8.6%).",
        "On this basis, the technical staff revised its 2022 growth forecast upward from 5.0% to 6.3%.The sustained recovery in GDP continues to favor the momentum in the labor market.",
        "In May, the figure for employed population registered an annual growth of 11.0% in the national total, and of 10.5% in the 13 main cities, which was reflected in significant annual reductions of the unemployment rate.",
        "Nationwide, it is already below its pre-pandemic level, as suggested by the seasonally adjusted series (10.6% in May 2022 vs. 11.1% in February 2020).",
        "The increase in employment and the reduction of unemployment, together with the observed increase in vacancy rates (which show a significant recovery in demand for new jobs), point to a tighter labor market.In an environment of a robust domestic demand and despite the improvement in the terms of trade, the current account registered a 6.4% deficit as a share of the quarterly GDP in the first quarter of the year, increasing from the 4.1% deficit as a share of GDP for the same period of last year.",
        "This excess demand occurs when external financing has become more expensive due to tightening global financial conditions.By unanimously endorsing a 150 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate, the Board reaffirmed its full commitment to achieving convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target in the medium term, aware of the persistence of the shocks that have driven upwards both food prices and those in the basic basket excluding food and regulated items.",
        "The Board Members stressed that this decision was taken in the context of a vigorously expanding economy with favorable effects on job creation, while simultaneously exhausting the spare capacity that subsided after the pandemic.In their individual reflections, the members of the Board agreed to point out several factors that call for a greater adjustment of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "Beyond highlighting the high levels of inflation, the Board stressed that inflation expectations from various surveys have risen significantly, thus increasing the risk of de-anchoring them.",
        "In addition, the increase in expectations has reduced the real interest rate, thus relaxing the monetary policy stance.",
        "They noted that the dynamism of consumer credit suggests that moderation in household spending could be delayed, which would contribute to prolong the economy’s excessive demand.",
        "They also cautioned against the inflationary effects that could arise from the recent peso depreciation vis-a-vis the US dollar, primarily due to the adjustment observed in the United States’ monetary policy and the one announced in the European Union.",
        "This has already been reflected in significant increases of term interest rates in global financial markets.Some Board Members highlighted that the inflationary outlook takes place in the context of a fuel price policy that has contributed to restrain inflation at a high fiscal cost.",
        "In the short term, inflation dynamics may be altered by the degree in the reduction of these subsidies.One member of the Board highlighted the limitations of analysis and forecasting tools in a post-pandemic economy, where many relationships seem to have changed.",
        "In this regard, s/he highlighted supply chains, the food price crisis, and the expectation-building process, all of which are global factors.",
        "The first two seem to reflect a change in relative prices more than inflation alone.",
        "The case of food is particularly acute in Colombia.",
        "The constraints of the tools have led other countries to restrictive monetary policies, which have resulted in slowing economies with high inflation.",
        "Additionally, the usual assumptions regarding the formation of expectations must consider that the impact of price increases is greater on ordinary people than on financial and monetary market agents.Another Board Member expressed concern about the increasing gap between the inflation target and most forecasts for both 2022 and the two following years.",
        "This suggests that the conceptual basis of the models usually employed by analysts and by the Board itself, usually assuming a process of convergence towards the 3.0% target, could be evolving adversely and could threaten the nature of the target as a nominal anchor as it has been over the years.",
        "For this reason, s/he considered that in future discussions over the next few months, it would be important to give greater weight to the possibility of a wider de-anchoring than has been assumed and, therefore, to a stronger adjustment in monetary policy.In the opinion of the majority, the interest rate adjustment made by the Board will allow bringing monetary policy more quickly to a path that reduces inflation and ensures its convergence to the target in the medium term.",
        "However, this adjustment does not suggest that subsequent increments will be of the same magnitude.",
        "In this regard, the Board agreed that in such an uncertain environment there are no grounds to anticipate the magnitude of future monetary policy adjustments.",
        "Therefore, they ratify that decisions will depend on the information available at a given moment in time.",
        "Four Board Members voted in favor of this decision.",
        "One Bord Member voted for an increase of 125 bp, and another voted for an increase of 25 bp.In their policy discussion, the Board of Directors considered the following elements:In November, the annual headline inflation was 12.5%, and core inflation (excluding food and regulated products) was 8.8%.",
        "In both cases, this exceeded the technical staff's forecasts (11.8% and 8.6%, respectively).",
        "Food supply shocks, accumulated exchange rate pressure on prices, and indexation to high inflation rates accounted for most of the surge in inflation.",
        "Currently, nearly 97% of the items in the consumer basket show annual changes that exceed the 3.0% target.Annual GDP growth in the third quarter reached 7.1% and exceeded the technical staff's forecast (6.4%).",
        "The higher-than-expected growth was partly attributable to better domestic demand spurred by investment in housing and machinery and equipment.",
        "Private consumption registered a drop in quarterly terms and a lower-than-expected annual growth.",
        "Growth of 8.0% is forecast for 2022 despite the signs of a slowdown in the economy that are already becoming apparent.",
        "These are likely to be accentuated in 2023 and lead to a 0.5% growth.Inflation expectations remained above target at all horizons.",
        "The monthly survey of analyst expectations done by Banco de la República in December showed headline and non-food inflation expectations of 7.5% and 7.0% for 2023, and 4.5% and 3.9% for 2024, respectively.",
        "Inflation expectations for 2 and 5 years calculated on the basis of public debt instruments (adjusted for liquidity premia and inflationary risk) stand at 6.8% and 5.3%.The current account deficit reached a historically high level of 7.2% of the GDP in the third quarter of 2022. International financial conditions for Colombia have improved after a worrisome deterioration during the third week of October.",
        "This has been made evident in the recent falls in TES rates and risk premia as well as in the decline and lower volatility of the exchange rate.",
        "Globally, financial conditions remain tight, in a context in which the world economy is expected to slow down and interest rates are expected to rise across the board.In view of the conditions described above, all the members of the Board agreed on the need to continue tightening monetary policy.",
        "However, they differed as to the amount of the required interest rate increase.",
        "Four Board Members voted in favor of a 100 bp increase, one supported a 125 bp increase, and another preferred a 25 bp increase.The majority group emphasized that the rising trend in headline and core inflation that continued through November and contrasted with the falls in inflation that are beginning to be seen in other economies called for a significant increase in the interest rate to achieve a process of convergence of inflation towards the target within a reasonable period of time.",
        "They pointed out that excess demand continues to be evident, and that the strength of the loan portfolio remains high since it reached an annual growth rate of close to 17.0% at the beginning of December.",
        "They added that, despite the correction of the exchange rate in recent weeks, the depreciation of the peso, which over the last year has been 20%, will continue to exert upward pressure on prices.",
        "They pointed out that the persistence of high and still rising inflation as well as inflation expectations that are above the target continue to stimulate price indexation processes that hinder the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Finally, they expressed their concern about the country's high foreign deficit in an international environment in which financing conditions abroad continue to be tight.",
        "With respect to this, they thought that the government's fiscal efforts were necessary and noted that they are key to the reduction of the foreign current account deficit.The Board Member who voted for a 125 bp interest rate hike insisted that economic activity remains at robust levels, inflation remains elevated across all baskets, and inflation expectations remain high.",
        "This suggests that the inflation target is not likely to be achieved over the policy horizon.",
        "S/he noted that the foreign imbalance has reached worrying levels and that, despite its expected decline in the coming year, its financing continues to be a challenge.",
        "Finally, s/he pointed out that the 16% increase in the minimum wage for 2023 impacts inflation through not only higher production costs and the reinforcement of demand, but also the higher nominal benchmark that such an increase establishes for the adjustment of other prices in the economy.The Board Member who voted in favor of a 25 bp increase in the policy rate emphasized that between October and November there had been a significant slowdown in aggregate demand.",
        "This s/he deduced from leading indicators such as the consumer confidence index (CCI) which has been showing consecutive declines and had reached levels in November similar to those observed in -2021.",
        "Likewise, there have been decreases in the business confidence index (BCI) which, after having achieved a significant recovery towards the end of 2021, reverted to levels in November similar to those seen in March 2021, when the country was experiencing new waves of Covid.",
        "Other indicators such as the trend in imports, passenger transportation, new vehicle registrations, energy demand, fuel deliveries, and creation of employment, etc., confirm this deceleration.",
        "All of this could evidence that the growth of demand in the economy has already slowed down and may even be in contraction.",
        "From this point of view, this Board Member argued that the purpose of monetary policy to control excess demand has already been achieved, so further interest rate hikes are counterproductive.",
        "S/he also pointed out that the tripartite minimum wage increase reflects the increase in inflation for low-income households plus the increase in productivity, and these together add up to 15.6%.",
        "Moreover, s/he added that although international financial conditions are still tight, there has been a recent improvement for Colombia as shown by the decline in and stability of the exchange rate during the last few weeks, the reduction of risk margins for public debt in international private markets, and the decrease in TES interest rates.",
        "Finally, s/he noted that the current account imbalance reflects, to a large extent, the increase in imports which are already beginning to decline due to the weakening of domestic demand.The Board reiterated that with the decision adopted by the majority, the process of adjusting the monetary policy continues in order to drive inflation towards its 3.0% target in the medium term, in the context of sustainable economic growth.",
        "They emphasized that to this end, they will continue to make the decisions they deem necessary based on new information available.",
        "The decision was based on the following considerations:Various inflation indicators continued to rise.",
        "Total annual inflation moved from 9.1% in May to 9.7% in June, while core inflation excluding food and regulated items increased from 5.9% to 6.1% in the same period.",
        "Upward pressure on prices was heightened by the increase in excess demand, the effects of indexation, exchange rate pressures and the persistence of international cost shocks.",
        "The rise in core inflation indicators confirmed a significant diffusion of price increases.Inflation expectations maintained an upward trend, especially those from surveys, whereas those drawn from the public debt markets were characterized by high volatility, while all continue above the 3% target.",
        "The Banco de la República's monthly survey of analyst expectations found that, between June and July, expected inflation for 2022 increased from 8.6% to 9.2%, and for 2023 from 4.7% to 5.2%, according to the sample median.Economic activity continued to exhibit a strong dynamism during the second quarter driven by growth in domestic demand, especially private consumption.",
        "On this framework, the technical staff revised upwards the growth forecast for 2022 from 6.3% to 6.9%, which suggests an output level that would continue to surpass the productive capacity of the economy for the remainder of 2022.June showed a sustained year-to-year employment growth reflected in both national employment (9.7%) and that in the 13 main cities (8.6%).",
        "As a result, the unemployment rate fell year-on-year in the national aggregate (-3.4pp) and the 13 main cities (-4.5pp), reaching 11.3% and 11.7%, respectively.World inflation continues rising and has become more persistent, contributing to increases in the monetary policy interest rates of developed markets, as has been the recent case of the U Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.",
        "In this scenario, fears of a global recession have generated large volatility in financial markets and a decrease in some commodity prices such as oil and copper.Based on these considerations, all members of the BDBR agreed on the need to continue the monetary policy adjustment process that ensures a return to the 3% annual inflation target within a setting of an economy that continues to grow at a good pace amid the intensifying inflationary pressures.",
        "Six board members were in favor of a 150-basis point increase and one in favor of a 100-point increase.The six board members considered that the 150-point increase of the monetary policy rate, which replicates that carried out in June, adequately moves towards the level required for the inflation rate to converge in the medium term towards its annual 3.0% target.",
        "This will make it possible to temper the pace of future additional increases in the monetary policy interest rate to try to minimize the short-term costs on economic growth that the convergence process of inflation towards the target may have.",
        "These board members referred to various reasons to support their decision: escalations in international interest rates and risk premiums encourage an increase in the neutral interest rate; variations over the last 13 weeks of the annualized loan portfolio exceed 22%, which supports a demand increase that exceeds that of supply and translates into a current account deficit which remains high and increases risk premiums; inflation expectations remain high for the medium term and, in the short term, risks of inflationary pressures in items such as rents and public services are perceived.",
        "Additionally, the growth trend and its upward revision sustain a positive output gap that, along with the labor market improvement, suggests that demand pressures on prices will continue during the remainder of the year.",
        "Finally, they noted that core inflation excluding foods and regulated items has continued to rise and currently exceeds 6.0%, which reflects a greater inflation diffusion among all the components of the CPI basket.The board member who voted for a 100 b increase expressed doubts about the capacity of neo-Keynesian models such as the one applied by the technical staff, which - although useful in the past environment of economic stability - ceased to be reliable to adequately reflect the current reality after the strong structural shocks to the productive apparatus caused by the pandemic and the subsequent exogenous supply shocks.",
        "The board member also expressed concern regarding a macroeconomic consistency issue wherein the public sector increases aggregate demand, expands the external deficit and tends to crowd out the private sector due to its pandemic-derived high fiscal deficit.",
        "Likewise, within the private sector, the member pointed out that companies have over-adjusted, thus generating savings, while households have under-adjusted, continuing with excess spending and dissaving.",
        "Under these circumstances, the board member argues that sharp interest rate increases do not necessarily ensure that the macroeconomic balance will be restored, and rather tend to be contractionary.",
        "Additionally, the member noted that several indicators already show moderation in credit dynamics and other key variables, suggesting that a drastic adjustment of the interest rate may be more harmful than beneficial.The BDBR stated that through this decision it continues with the monetary policy adjustment process that ensures the return to the 3% inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The Board will continue to closely monitor all economic indicators and make decisions it deems necessary, based on new information available.",
        "Banco de la República's Board of Directors (BDBR) unanimously decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 100 basis points (bp) to 11%.In the discussion on monetary policy, the following elements were considered:During October, adverse financial conditions worsened, brought on by global and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "These conditions caused a higher monthly depreciation of the COP/USD exchange rate than that of other emerging economies and an increase of TES interest rates and risk premia.Total annual inflation rose from 10.8% to 11.4% from August to September, whereas core inflation—excluding food and regulated items—went from 6.9% to 7.5%.",
        "The increase in inflation is explained by additional pressure in food production costs, higher electricity prices, the exchange rate pass-through to tradable goods, strong demand, and indexation processes for rising inflation rates.Expected inflation measures continued to increase during the last month, steering away from the target.",
        "Banco de la República’s monthly survey of economic analysts indicates that the expected annual inflation rate went from 6,3% to 6,7%.",
        "Other surveys (carried out by third parties) indicate additional increases in the expected inflation for 2023.According to the economic tracking indicator (ISE), the annual growth for economic activity during August was 8.7%, driven by consumption growth as well as by investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "The technical staff’s annual GDP growth forecast is 7.9% for 2022 and 0.5% for 2023.",
        "Despite the expected deceleration, the GDP forecast sets values 12% higher than those observed in 2019, prior to the pandemic.",
        "On the other hand, expected total consumption is 15% higher than that observed for 2019.According to the most recent data, employment levels are significantly higher than those that preceded the pandemic and have been on the rise for all sectors, especially the formal sector.",
        "Labor participation has been stable and the unemployment rate has dropped beneath 11%.",
        "Other indicators of the labor market, such as the ratio of job openings to unemployment, also suggest favorable labor behavior.Observed rises in inflation, economic activity, the exchange rate, risk premia, and interest rates have surpassed the technical staff’s projections.",
        "These new elements pose a different scenario from the one considered in the last Board of Directors meeting.All members of the Board of Directors consider that, during the last month, the conditions for external financing of the economy have been deteriorating.",
        "Although this deterioration was partially reverted in days prior to the Board’s meeting, the most recent data still show depreciation of the Colombian peso and an increase in the risk premium for the public debt, when compared to one month prior.",
        "All of the aforementioned justify a 100pb increase of the interest rate.",
        "This unanimous decision is a strong manifestation of the Board’s commitment to monetary and exchange rate stability.During their personal statements, several directors highlighted the high levels observed for inflation, economic activity, and international interest rates, which are higher than expected during the last Board meeting.",
        "These directors expressed their concern for the persistent increase of the economy’s demand above levels sustainable in the long-term, as well as for the increase in inflation expectations for the next years.",
        "With the interest rate increase, they seek to contribute to the adjustment of economic activity towards levels sustainable in the long-term and to the convergence of inflation expectations at the inflation target.Some directors also stated their concern regarding fiscal imbalance and the public debt market’s vulnerability.",
        "They expressed that the decision of increasing the interest rate contributes to sustaining foreign investor confidence in the Colombian public debt market and financing of the current account deficit.",
        "One of the directors highlighted the need to balance nominal GDP growth and the growth of monetary aggregates through the increase of interest rates that would strengthen demand in the Colombian peso market.All of the directors underlined the importance of supply factors in the recent evolution of inflation.",
        "One of them considered that these factors are, by far, the determining factor and expects them to improve in the upcoming months, contributing to reducing inflation.",
        "Be that as it may, for this director, the economy’s financing conditions, along with growing international interest rates, justify the agreed upon interest rate increase.",
        "The monetary policy rate is in a contractionary stance, with which a path of convergence towards the target inflation rate of 3% is expected to be guaranteed.",
        "This stance reaffirms the commitment of the Board of Directors to the inflation target as well as to the stabilization of economic activity in the most sustainable way possible.",
        "On January 28, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) voted 5-2 to approve a 100-basis point increase to the benchmark interest rate, bringing it to 4.0%; two dissenting members voted for a 75-point increase.The decision took into account the following considerations:Both headline and core inflation closed the year above expectations and on upward trajectories.Inflation expectations are high and also ended the year on an upward trajectory.",
        "The technical staff revised its inflation forecast accordingly, projecting year-end headline and core inflation above the target for 2022 (4.3% and 4.5%, respectively) and 2023 (3.4% and 3.6%).Interest rate increases in money, credit, and capital markets beginning in the second quarter of 2021 can be explained in part by increased inflation expectations.Private and public consumption drove a continued expansion in economic activity in the last months of 2021.",
        "Private investment, by contrast, has been less dynamic.",
        "In response, the technical staff was able to reaffirm its GDP growth forecast for 2021 at close to 10%, with which remaining excess capacity in the economy would be nearly eliminated.",
        "GDP growth in 2022 would be forecast at around 4.3%.Aggregate demand performance and import growth that was faster than for exports led to an increase in the current account deficit from 3.5% of GDP in 2020 to an estimated 5.7% in 2021.",
        "This deficit is expected to remain at 4.9% of GDP in 2022, despite a positive international price outlook for Colombia's main export commodities.External financing will come under less favorable conditions than in 2021, given the imminent normalization of monetary policy in the United States and in other advanced economies.Moderating inflation expectations represents the most significant monetary policy challenge in the current environment.",
        "Unanchored inflation expectations could push price and salary indexation to above levels considered by the 3% target.",
        "The proximate elimination of excess capacity in the economy, after a significant recovery in demand and a lagging supply response, could make this risk more acute.Given the above, the board members were unanimous in their view on the need to continue normalizing monetary policy away from the strongly expansionary stance adopted in response to the pandemic.",
        "However, as in previous sessions, there remained differences of opinion over the speed with which this process should take place.The board members voting for a 100-basis point increase emphasized the following points:Interest rate increases, in many cases exceeding the 100 basis-point adjustment, have already been observed in diverse financial markets, reflecting increased inflation expectations.Increased inflation expectations could affect price and salary formation in coming months.A widening of the current account deficit that would:Reflect the inability of domestic supply to respond to demand.Imply a demanding financing process, given an imminent tightening of international financial conditions and taking into account the increase to Colombia's sovereign risk premium.The two directors who voted for a 75-point increase justified their preference for a more gradual adjustment based on the following considerations:Significant uncertainty remains around the state of the economy and its future outlook, as reflected in the variability of diverse forecasts analyzed over the past month.Anomalies and challenges in the labor market could grow more acute if normalization comes very quickly, especially amid continued high unemployment.A significant portion of the supply shocks that have affected prices on certain groups of goods, especially foods, have been notably transitory in nature.Excluding foods and regulated goods and services, inflation is below the target at 2.49%.Investment flows are lagging economic activity which, given the latter's interest rate sensitivity, could be perpetuated by a very rapid normalization of monetary policy.",
        "This would affect growth and employment.Performance in some sectors that are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate, such as small and micro-enterprises, remains weak.The BDBR emphasized that its monetary policy remains in position to stimulate the economy despite the 100-basis point increase to the benchmark interest rate.",
        "This takes into account the fact that in real terms the intervention rate continues in negative territory and below the natural rate of interest.",
        "Finally, the board reiterated its commitment to the 3% annual inflation target.",
        "On March 31, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) voted 5-2 in favor of a 100-basis point increase to the benchmark interest rate, bringing it to 5.0%; two board members voted for a 150-basis point increase.The decision took into account the following considerations:Headline inflation maintained its upward trajectory in the first two months of 2022.",
        "Consumer inflation rose in February by 8.01% in annual terms, compared to 5.62% in December 2021.",
        "Foods and regulated items continued to exert upward pressure on the price index, increasing annually in February by 23.3% and 8.91%, respectively.",
        "Inflation excluding food and regulated items rose in annual terms from 2.49% in December to 4.11% in February.The Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid ongoing disruptions to global supply chains and supply restrictions, may generate additional inflationary pressures on some commodities for which those countries play an important role in production and exports.",
        "These include oil, natural gas, coal, fertilizers, and various agricultural products.Short-term inflation expectations have continued to rise.",
        "The median response to Banco de la República's monthly survey of analyst expectations in March showed expected headline inflation of 6.42% in 2022 (compared to 4.48% in the January survey) and 3.83% in 2023 (3.50% in the January survey).",
        "The accumulated effects of shocks on the economy have also led to increased inflation expectations in some medium-term indicators.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from financial market information from January to March showed increases in BEI inflation (excluding liquidity and inflation risk premiums) at two years from 3.68% to 4.57% and at five years from 3.65% to 4.14%.The most recently available data suggests that economic activity has maintained its positive impulse from 2021, with the economic tracking indicator (ISE) suggesting annual growth in January of 7.8%.",
        "The Bank's monthly commercial and industrial survey showed manufacturing growth of 15.1% in annual terms in January, while real commercial retail sales grew by 20.9%.",
        "Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate fell from 15.5% in February 2021 to 12.9% in February 2022.",
        "In this context, the technical staff has revised its growth projection for 2022 upward from 4.3% to 4.7%.",
        "In the technical staff's projection models, this increase suggests that excess productive capacity will continue to close at a faster rate than previously expected, especially if potential output is affected by supply shocks and lagging investment.Based on these considerations, all members of the BDBR were in agreement over the need to continue to adjust monetary policy by increasing the benchmark interest rate to keep inflation expectations at the target.",
        "These steps would also be expected to diffuse the effects of supply shocks and increased international prices on other components of the goods basket, as reflected in increases to indicators of core inflation.",
        "While the board members agreed that the policy rate increase will contribute to a gradual convergence of inflation to the target, they differed over the size of the increase that should be adopted at this time.",
        "Five board members were in favor of a 100-basis point increase, while two members voted for a 150-point increase.The five board members supporting a 100-point rise suggested it would reflect a significant increase to the policy rate that replicated the increase approved in January.",
        "These board members considered it prudent to maintain the pace of the interest rate increase adopted by the BDBR in January, given current international uncertainty, the need for continued recovery in Colombian employment levels, and the importance of maintaining economic performance following the significant shocks of the pandemic.",
        "They also considered that this increase would be sufficient as part of a gradual process of controlling inflation expectations, which for 2023 and beyond reflect a decrease compared to current inflation levels.",
        "Expectations of reduced inflation rates suggest that monetary policy remains credible and that target inflation continues to anchor price formation.The two board members voting for a 150-point increase emphasized Colombia's strong recent performance in economic activity and improvements in employment indicators.",
        "They expressed concern that the inflation environment may become more difficult due to potential price pressures from significant increases registered in the producer price index.",
        "They also highlighted that gas price subsidies, which have provided relief to consumers, are unlikely to be sustainable.",
        "They perceived a risk that current nominal contracts, which tend to be agreed at one-year terms, will incorporate higher inflation expectations and generate persistent upward pressures on production costs that could affect the productive capacity of the economy.",
        "Finally, they expressed concern over the faster-than-expected withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the U, coinciding with increased risk premiums in Colombia associated largely with political uncertainty.All members of the BDBR emphasized that the 100-basis point increase on March 31 came as part of a gradual but steady process that will continue in the coming months to ensure a progressive return to inflation at the 3% annual target.",
        "This policy decisión was based on the following considerations.Headline inflation in August was 10.8%, a figure above the 9.9% annual rate forecast by the technical staff.",
        "Core inflation (excluding food and regulated items) kept on an upward trend, reaching an annualized rate of 6.9% in that month.",
        "The percentage of items equal to or above the target in August 2022 stood at 89%, surpassing the rate observed a year earlier (61.7%) and confirming a significant difussion in price increases.Inflation expectations at different horizons mantained an upward trend, showing considerable sensitivity to recent inflation.",
        "In the case of economic analysts, Banco de la República's survey showed inflation expectations for the end of 2023 increased from 5.5% to 6.3% between August and September, according to the median of the sample.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from the debt markets also rose significantly, especially for shorter terms.The pace of economic activity so far this year has consistently exceeded the technical staff´s forecasts and those of the market.",
        "The momentum has been due to a build-up in domestic demand, driven largely by high growth in household consumption.",
        "On this basis, the technical staff increased the forecast for real GDP growth in 2022 from 6.9% to 7.8%.The economic tracking indicator (ISE), as well as several indicators for the third quarter, are beginning to show signs of a slowdown in productive activity.",
        "This trend could strengthen in the coming months as a result of exhaustion of the effects of post-pandemic pent-up demand, the impact of higher inflation on real income, less fiscal stimulus and the restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "Taking all these factors into account, plus the risks associated with an adverse international context, the technical staff revised its forecast for growth in 2023 from 1.1% to 0.7%.The Board of Directors agreed to continue the monetary policy adjustment that has been underway for the past year, which they believe is necessary in an economy where inflation and its expectations remain significantly above target, causing a high degree of indexation.",
        "Hikes in external interest rates, higher risk premia and the volatility in international financial markets also influenced this decision.",
        "The Board knows an adjustment of this magnitude requires weighing the prospect of a slowdown in economic activity against that of inflation, which is still far from the target, driving expectations that feed back into it.",
        "In this context, six members voted in favor of a 100 bp increase and one Board member supported a 50 bp increase.In their individual interventions, the members of the majority group noted several reasons for their vote.",
        "Recent economic forces at work may have led to an increase in the output gap.",
        "While credit growth has stabilized, it has done so at fairly high rates, particularly for the consumer portfolio which is growing at an annual rate of nearly 23%.",
        "Core inflation has shown a strong upward trend.",
        "Inflation expectations respond mostly to increases in actual inflation, creating a mechanism that reinforces further price hikes.",
        "The current account deficit in the balance of payments, which is close to 6.0% of GDP, could see its future financing compromised in an environment of high global interest rates and growing risk aversion in international financial markets.",
        "Projected economic growth for 2022 improved by almost one percentage point, but the outlook for growth in 2023 was reduced by slightly less than half a percentage point.",
        "In these circumstances, six members felt a 100 bp increase to be appropriate, while giving a clear signal of the Board's commitment to fighting inflation.The Board Member who voted for a 50 bp increase noted the greatest risk at this point in time is a sharp slowdown in productive activity and, therefore, in employment.",
        "S/he also pointed out that the benchmark interest rate hikes during the past year have yet to contain the rise in inflation or its expectations, as current inflation is due primarily to supply shocks.",
        "Surplus demand is manifest more in upturns in imports  than in higher prices .",
        "This being the case, further interest rate hikes would affect economic growth far more than inflation.",
        "The trend increase in external interest rates entails similar adjustments in domestic interest rates.",
        "On this point, the member pointed out that such high interest rates imply considerable risks for the consumer portfolio, the productive sector and government financing.The Board of Directors reiterated its commitment to seeing that inflation converges towards the 3.0% annual target, as a fundamental requirement to ensure the momentum and sustainability of economic growth in the medium and long term.",
        "In this regard, they noted that additional increases in the policy rate may be necessary in the months ahead, depending on data availability at any given time on the domestic and external economic situation and its outlook.",
        "On April 29, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) voted 4-3 in favor of a 100-basis point increase to the benchmark interest rate, bringing it to 6.0%; three board members voted for a 150-basis point increase.The decision took into account the following considerations:Headline inflation in March rose in annual terms by 8.53%, marking a year of continuous increases.",
        "Inflation excluding food and regulated items rose from 4.11% in February to 4.51% in MarchAnalysts' inflation expectations rose to 7% for 2022; expected inflation was 4% for 2023 and 3.7% 24 months forward.Economic activity continued to suggest significant dynamism in the Colombian economy.",
        "The economic tracking indicator (ISE) registered 7.9% annual growth in February in seasonally adjusted figures.",
        "The technical staff revised its 2022 growth forecast upward from 4.7% to 5.0%, and maintained its 2023 projection of 2.9%.",
        "With this the technical staff estimates that remaining excess productive capacity in the economy would have been depleted.Persistent disruptions to global supply chains, the escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and new quarantine restrictions in China related to -19 could accentuate upward pressure on international food and energy prices.The BDBR was unanimous in its support for the need to continue to adjust monetary policy to ensure the progressive return of inflation to the 3% annual target, in line with Colombia's ongoing economic recovery.",
        "The board members noted that inflation has become more accentuated and has extended to diverse components of the basic family basket beyond foods.",
        "They highlighted the importance of continuing to adjust monetary policy to moderate the increase in inflation expectations and prevent second-order effects.",
        "They also underscored the strength of economic activity, largely a product of monetary stimulus in 2020 and 2021 that has ceased to be necessary and the continuation of which would risk generating demand pressures on prices.",
        "They also signaled the emergence of new sources of external uncertainty that could lead to increased inflationary pressures.Additionally, the board members examined improvements in the labor market observed in recent months and concluded that it would cease to be a source of downward pressure on the inflation rate.",
        "Finally, they noted that U Federal Reserve's shift to less expansionary monetary policy, in line with similar steps taken in other countries, together with an increased risk premium would make financing for Colombia more difficult both in fiscal terms and for the current account, and would generate upward pressure on the exchange rate.While the board members were in agreement over these points, they express differing opinions on the speed with which monetary policy should be adjusted in light of recent economic developments.",
        "Four board members supported a 100 basis-point increase to the policy rate, while three voted in favor of a 150-basis point increase.The board members who voted in favor of a 100-basis point increase, which came after two rate increases of the same magnitude in previous meetings, considered it to be sufficient as part of an ongoing monetary policy adjustment process aimed at ensuring convergence to the inflation target while also being gradual enough to preserve dynamism in productive activity.",
        "They underlined that this process would continue as more information becomes available in the coming months.",
        "The board members noted that economic activity in the year-to-date has suggested significant dynamism in the Colombian economy, but identified some symptoms of deceleration in aggregate demand given the fall in consumer confidence indicators in recent months and lower levels of real imports beginning in November 2021.",
        "Finally, they signaled that the increase in inflation in March was marginally lower than in previous months, and that medium-term inflation expectations have started to show convergence to the 3% target.The members of the board who voted for a 150 basis-point increase highlighted that the most recent surveys of analysts' inflation expectations increased significantly for 2022, and to a lesser extent for 2023 and forward 24 months as well.",
        "They noted that this would suggest more persistent inflation that could weaken the credibility of the return of inflation toward the target pursued by monetary policy.",
        "They highlighted that the credit market has shown significant dynamism, particularly in the commercial and consumer portfolios.",
        "They reiterated their preference for a faster adjustment to the interest rate that would contribute to maximizing the impact of policy decisions on inflation expectations and on price-fixing practices, and could reduce the risk that subsequent increases to the policy rate would need to be of a greater magnitude.There was consensus among the board members that the decision adopted in this meeting reiterated the BDBR's commitment to a gradual but steady adjustment of monetary policy that would guarantee the progressive return of inflation to the 3% annual target."

    "2024": [
        "Annual inflation fell in August to 6.1%, below forecasts by the Bank’s technical staff and the market.",
        "This easing was partly driven by lower-than-expected prices in the food basket, with food inflation falling from 5.3% to 3.4% between July and August, primarily resulting from an ample supply of perishable products.",
        "The regulated items basket also experienced inflationary relief, with some public service prices seeing more minor adjustments, along with a downward trend in year-to-year fuel price changes.",
        "Core inflation excluding food and regulated items dropped to 5.5%, mostly due to lower goods inflation reflecting smaller increases in international prices and costs.Most public debt market inflation expectations declined, with several pointing to inflation approaching the 3% target over the next twelve months.",
        "Nevertheless, Banco de la República’s monthly survey of economic analyst expectations remained relatively unchanged, with above-target forecasts for 12 to 24-month horizons.",
        "This expectation variance could be credited to a slower easing in the benchmark rate foreseen by analysts versus that of the market.Seasonally adjusted GDP grew 1.8% year-on-year in the second quarter, driven by a robust 1.6% increase from internal demand primarily provoked by household consumption that remains at high levels relative to its pre-pandemic trend.",
        "On the other hand, while gross fixed capital formation rose by 2.2%, it remains below pre-pandemic levels and at considerably lower levels had the pre-pandemic trend continued.",
        "On the supply side, agriculture, arts and recreation, and public administration were the most dynamic sectors.",
        "Also noteworthy was an expansion in the works category (13.9%), offsetting the drop in the construction sector.",
        "Some July economic activity indicators, including retail sales, sectoral surveys, and the ISE (economic tracking indicator for its Spanish acronym), suggest that the economy continued to extend its recovery into the third quarter.Despite a 50 bp interest rate cut and expectations of further cuts by the US Federal Reserve, risk premiums rose in Latin America.",
        "The latter has been more prominent in Colombia, as credit default swaps for the country - a measure of debt risk at different horizons – show Colombia’s current risk premium levels above those of its main Latin American peers and other emerging economies.",
        "This is partly attributed to falling oil prices and fiscal challenges, among other factors.The members of the Board of Directors agreed that economic activity in Colombia has been gaining force over the course of 2024 as annual inflation continues to cool.",
        "This process has been facilitated by a monetary policy that has simultaneously sought to bring inflation closer to the target while limiting the impact on economic activity.",
        "Although the fall in inflation has been significant, it continues at a high level, twice above target, which invites caution, making it necessary to continue with a contractionary monetary stance.",
        "To this end, the Directors debated the best decision based on assessments and projections prepared by the Bank's technical staff.",
        "Four Board members voted for a 50-basis point policy rate cut, and three voted for a 75 bp reduction without reaching a consensus.The majority considers that conditions are favorable for further monetary policy easing.",
        "These feature the substantial decline seen in annual inflation during July and August, the decrease in inflation expectations implied in the behavior of the debt market, and the recent interest rate cut by the Fed along with signs that this easing will continue.",
        "However, some members of this group consider that accelerating the pace of policy rate cuts beyond 50 bps could entail significant risks that could hamper the stability of this process.",
        "Tempering factors include (i) the still high level of inflation in Colombia compared to both regional and international counterparts, (ii) the persistence of inflation in services, particularly in indexed items such as rents, (iii) the uncertainty surrounding adjustments to the minimum wage for next year, and (iv) inflexibility in economic analysts’ inflation expectations, in line with their prognosis of a looser monetary outlook.",
        "This group of directors emphasizes that the growing fiscal uncertainty, given the unclearness of the size of the fiscal deficit and the way it will be financed, makes it difficult for the country to fully benefit from more relaxed external financial conditions, contributing to increasing inflationary exchange rate risks.",
        "Under these conditions, they highlight that a 50 bp reduction in the policy rate, preceded by similar cuts in past meetings, is a significant step to reduce the contractionary stance and consistent with the objectives proposed by the Board of Directors.",
        "It also contributes to reinforcing the perception that policy interest rate cuts may continue in the future, which has been essential for easing the lending and deposit interest rate terms in the financial system beyond the benchmark rate.",
        "The prospect of a sustained inflation and interest rate reduction process has also contributed to the economic recovery signaled in 2024 and to positive outlooks for Colombia’s economic growth for 2025 and 2026 at rates in line with its potential.",
        "This occurs amid a backdrop of stable year-on-year employment levels and an unemployment rate that remains below the Bank's technical staff’s long-term projection.The directors of the Board, who voted for a 75-basis point reduction, emphasized that monetary policy has been able to encourage a sustained decline in inflation, bringing it closer to the target.",
        "Some underscored that this fact is reflected in the inflation expectations obtained from both public debt markets and analysts and is a critical element that provides confidence in achieving the inflation target as the monetary policy easing continues to take effect in the context of lower international prices and more favorable external financial conditions.",
        "They emphasize that these circumstances provide the opportunity to encourage the outbreaks of economic reactivation currently experienced, particularly in investment, and therefore boost the prospects for future economic growth.",
        "In this regard, this group of directors notes that the fall in gross fixed capital formation halted, and its main components - works and machinery and equipment - grew in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "One of the directors highlighted the lack of macroeconomic space to increase investment.",
        "Another positive factor with the past adjustment is the improvement in the current account deficit, with a reduction that has continued into the second quarter of 2024.",
        "Some directors add that the labor market shows signs of weakening by registering in July 2024 a national unemployment rate of 9.9%, higher by 0.3 pp than the 9.6% level seen in July 2023.",
        "They emphasize that the creation of 21,000 jobs last July is the lowest job creation figure seen post-pandemic.",
        "They point out a year-on-year drop in labor force participation (64.2% in July 2024 vs. 64.8% in the same month of 2023) and a lower employment rate (57.8% versus 58.6% in 2023).",
        "They also note that the unemployment rate in the quarter from May to July 2024 was 10.2% compared to 9.8% in the same quarter in 2023.",
        "In this context, these directors emphasize their concern that the monetary policy stance has become more restrictive, considering that the inflation rate reductions have outpaced the policy rate cuts.The members of the Board agreed that the decision adopted at this session continues to support the recovery of economic growth while maintaining the necessary prudence considering persistent risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "The Board of Directors reiterates that future decisions will be determined based on new information available.",
        "Annual inflation rose slightly from 7.16% to 7.18% between May and June.",
        "Core inflation excluding food and regulated items decreased from 6.1% to 6.0%, aligning with the technical staff's forecasts.",
        "Annual food inflation continued to increase, from 4.4% to 5.3%, driven by climatic factors affecting the prices of some perishable foods.",
        "This increase was offset by a reduction in regulated items inflation, which dropped from 13.7% to 13.3%, as well as a decrease in the annual inflation of non-food and non-regulated goods, which fell from 1.7% to 1.4%, supported by positive global supply and the Colombian peso's appreciation against the US dollar.Twelve-month inflation expectations from the Bank's survey of economic analysts in July decreased from 4.3% to 4.2% compared to the June survey, while 24-month inflation expectations remained steady at 3.4% in the sample median.",
        "Expectations derived from public debt markets fell across all horizons, with some projections beginning to enter the Bank’s -2025 target of 3+/-1% announced last November.Economic activity indicators suggest that GDP would remain on a recovery path during the second quarter, with varying performances among sectors.",
        "The primary sector and certain public sector and entertainment services performed well, while secondary activities, including industry and construction, showed negative annual growth but exhibited initial signs of improvement on a monthly basis.",
        "The technical staff forecasts continued recovery in economic activity, projecting  GDP growth of 1.8% in 2024, up from the 1.4% forecast in April.The downward trend in inflation in the United States and other developed economies, coupled with the marginal deterioration of the U labor market suggests potential easing of external financing conditions.",
        "This expectation is based on anticipated more accommodative monetary policies from central banks in these countries.iento externas más holgadas, ante la expectativa de políticas monetarias más acomodaticias por parte de los bancos centrales de dichos países.As in previous sessions, the Board of Directors unanimously agreed on the necessity of continuing to reduce the benchmark rate to stimulate economic activity.",
        "This consensus reflects the recognition of favorable conditions that support a shift towards a less contractionary monetary policy stance.",
        "This is confirmed by the declining trends in both headline and core inflation, as well as their expectations, the moderate pace of economic growth, the significant reduction in the current account deficit, and the prospect of easing global financial conditions.",
        "Simultaneously, the Board members emphasize the importance of maintaining prudence in the process of cutting interest rates, given the remaining risks to inflation.",
        "These risks include the evolution of food prices, the unsustainable fiscal costs of postponing increases in prices and tariffs of regulated goods and services, the downward rigidity of inflation in some services, and potential exchange rate pressures due to volatile external conditions.",
        "In this context, there were differing opinions on the appropriate size of the rate cut.",
        "Based on the available information, five Directors voted to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points, while two Directors voted for a 75 basis point cut.The majority group reiterated several factors supporting the shift towards a less contractionary monetary policy stance but cautioned that a policy interest rate reduction exceeding 50 basis points might not be sustainable over time and could jeopardize the continuity of the process.",
        "They highlighted the persistent risks to inflation behavior, which diminish the likelihood of reaching the target within the proposed time frame.",
        "Notably, they observed that service inflation remains high, close to 8.0%, driven by the rigidity of key items such as rents and food away from home.",
        "They emphasized that the absence of exchange rate pressures cannot be assumed in an environment of significant external uncertainty and oil price volatility.",
        "Additionally, they noted that the country's risk premiums are relatively high amid challenging fiscal conditions, which create uncertainty for economic activity and investment, as reflected in recent documents from the Medium Term Fiscal Framework and the General Budget of the Nation.",
        "Under these conditions, they underscored that a 50 basis point cut in the policy interest rate is substantial, leading to a reduction in the real interest rate.",
        "This places it below the real intervention interest rate levels of countries like Brazil and Mexico, which have lower inflation rates than Colombia.The directors who voted for a 75 basis-point reduction in the benchmark rate acknowledge that inflation behavior is not without risks, as highlighted by the technical staff’s analysis and that of other Board members.",
        "However, they emphasize that the downward trend in inflation indicators and the decrease in inflation expectations across various horizons reflect the success of the contractionary policy and the likelihood of reaching the target next year.",
        "They particularly note that the reduction in some expectations derived from the debt market suggests that inflation could return to levels close to the 3% ± 1% target by -2025, within a context of more favorable international financial conditions, which bodes well for continuing efforts to bring inflation to its target.",
        "These directors also highlight the higher labor informality reported by DANE, indicating a deterioration in the quality of employment.",
        "They caution that the sectors with the most significant weight in the labor market structure are not the ones driving the highest employment and that employment levels are sustained by certain service branches associated with less stable jobs.",
        "In this context, these directors stress the need to persist in strengthening the economic recovery.",
        "Despite the technical staff's increased growth estimate for 2024 to 1.8%, Colombia still lags behind the regional average growth rate (2.0%) and peer countries such as Brazil (2.5%) and Chile (2.3%).",
        "Finally, they argue that the adjustment of Central Government spending and the commitment to comply with the fiscal rule in 2024 and 2025 create a better macroeconomic environment, opening a window of opportunity for a further policy interest rate cut.The Board members emphasized that the decision gives a new boost to economic growth recovery while maintaining the necessary prudence in light of persistent risks to the inflation outlook.",
        "The Board of Directors reiterates that future decisions will be determined based on new information available.",
        "By December, annual inflation had dropped for the ninth consecutive month and closed the year at 9.28%, in line with the technical staff’s December projection.",
        "Food and goods (excluding food and regulated items) fronted the inflationary decline, standing at 5% and 7.1% by yearend, respectively.",
        "Conversely, regulated items inflation rose to 17.2%, while an upside surprise came from the services basket (excluding regulated items), which continues to record high inflation rates of close to 9%.Most future inflation expectation measures fell, suggesting a downward trend over time.",
        "The Bank's monthly survey of economic analyst expectations conducted by Banco de la República found that the sample median one-year expectations dropped from 5.7% to 5.2%, and two-year expectations from 3.8% to 3.6% between December and January.",
        "Similarly, adjusted expectations drawn from the public debt markets showed a decrease across all maturities.The technical staff maintains a growth estimate of 1% for 2023 and 0.8% for 2024, compatible with long-term sustainable output levels and the convergence of inflation towards its target.",
        "Lower domestic demand is reflected in a narrowing of the current account deficit as a share of GDP from 6.2% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, reaching 2.9% in 2024.",
        "The correction of the country's external imbalance makes the economy less vulnerable to a significant decline in global conditions.External financial conditions have improved amid declining global inflation and a slower-than-projected deceleration of the world economy.",
        "In this context, Colombia's sovereign risk premium fell in 2023, and the peso appreciated at a higher rate than the currency of comparable countries in the region.The increase in the minimum wage for 2024 exceeded expectations, which influences the price path projected by the technical staff, especially in the services basket.",
        "There are also potential risks derived from the El Niño phenomenon on food and energy prices and possible adjustments in the prices of regulated items, which may impact the outlook.All Board members agreed on the existing positive conditions that favor a continued reduction of the policy interest rate, highlighting the inflationary decline during December despite the high inflation seen in regulated items.",
        "Moreover, both market-based and survey-based inflation expectations for the various terms have decreased.",
        "The Directors highlighted the slowing pace of economic activity, which exhibited a -0.3% variation in the third quarter of 2023, resulting from the significant contraction of investment, primarily in the housing, machinery and equipment, and works sectors.",
        "They stressed that the slower tempo of economic activity is already reflected in the concurrent slowdown in the labor market.",
        "With this in mind, the Directors differed on the amount of the policy rate reduction they considered appropriate under the current circumstances.",
        "Five Directors voted for a 25-bps reduction, while two voted for a 50-bps cut.The Directors who voted for a 25-bps reduction underscored that a faster decrease of the policy rate under current conditions risks eroding the credibility of the inflationary target.",
        "This attrition could impede further progress in the rate reduction process and monetary policy easing, resulting in higher costs to the national economy.",
        "They warned that, despite the reduction in inflation, it continues well above the target.",
        "While expectations have fallen, not all are consistent with achieving said target in the 12 to 18-month horizon announced by the Board last November.",
        "They stressed their concern regarding the behavior of the services basket, whose inflation has shown significant downward rigidity.",
        "They highlighted that the approach of inflation to the target faces significant risks in the form of severe drought caused by the El Niño phenomenon.",
        "They consider that the potential detrimental effects on the credibility of the short-term inflation target after three consecutive years of non-fulfillment require special caution in exercising monetary policy to prevent weather-related increases in food or utility prices from becoming sources of generalized inflationary pressures.",
        "Given the recent decline in inflation expectations, they emphasize that a 25-bps reduction in the policy rate maintains the real interest rate largely unchanged.",
        "The Directors note this is a prudent stance under the current circumstances, allowing time to assess the true extent of the El Niño phenomenon, evaluate the common rent and education price hikes that occur early in the year, and assess the potential effects of the recent minimum wage increase.",
        "They point out the fiscal uncertainty regarding the nature and certitude of some revenue sources in the national Financial Plan for 2024 and in the Government's Medium-Term Fiscal Framework to be published in June, which would require clarification.",
        "Overall, this group of Directors holds to the expectation of accommodating greater policy rate reductions in the coming months as current uncertainty sources dissipate.The Board members who voted for a 50-bps reduction noted that the contractionary monetary policy stance implemented since September 2021 has been generating the necessary macroeconomic adjustment, as evidenced by the slowdown of aggregate demand to levels compatible with productive capacity, resulting from the deceleration of consumption and the sharp decline in investment.",
        "In the same vein, the current account deficit has seen a significant correction, reducing, in turn, the economy's external vulnerability and the fiscal deficit in the year that just ended.",
        "This can be seen through inflation that continues to decline, along with a downward revision in its expectations, amid a growth environment that will remain weak into 2024, according to the technical staff’s projections.",
        "The Directors add that the labor market shows signs of weakening, notable in the higher unemployment rate seen in the seasonally adjusted series and the greater number of working-age individuals outside the labor force (inactive population).",
        "They warn that the annual industry employment growth rate has been negative since May, caused by the reduction in temporary employees.",
        "With the lower GDP growth projections for 2024, these trends could become more pronounced.",
        "Within this framework, they insist on the need to recover an upward investment path, thus reversing the sharp decline suffered in 2023, which would benefit notably from a substantial reduction in the policy rate by alleviating financing costs, one of the critical factors in investment decision-making.",
        "They believe that, against this backdrop, such a moderate cut in the policy rate would maintain the real interest rate firmly in contractionary territory, delaying the growth stimulus that the economy urgently requires and causing needless economic costs.The members of the Board of Directors agreed that, with the decision adopted at this meeting, the economy will continue its necessary adjustment process for inflation to converge towards the target by the first half of 2025 at the latest.",
        "Likewise, they reiterate that future decisions will be determined based on new information available.",
        "Annual headline inflation continued its downward trend during February, standing at 7.7% and exhibiting a cumulative drop of 1.5 percentage points (pp) during the first two months of the year.",
        "Likewise, annual inflation, excluding food and regulated items, had a 1.2 pp drop which, coupled with a substantial rise in food supply and lesser hikes in certain utilities and transportation services, played a role in moderating prices across most components of the consumer basket.",
        "However, inflation within the services sector maintained a relatively rigid downward trend, declining from 9% to 8.5% from December to February.",
        "This trend persists because essential items like rents, education, and personal services, among others, tend to adjust in line with observed inflation and wage increments.The different metrics used to gauge inflation expectations continued to drop, indicating an overall downward trajectory for inflation.",
        "The monthly survey of economic analyst expectations conducted by Banco de la República showed that, from December to March, median inflation expectations fell from 5.7% to 4.7% in the one-year horizon and from 3.8% to 3.5% in the two-year horizon.",
        "Similarly, adjusted expectations drawn from the public debt markets continued to present downward adjustments for all maturities.The technical staff revised their inflation forecast down for yearend 2024 from 5.9% to 5.4%.",
        "This adjustment is made within an environment where cumulative monetary policy measures will continue, bringing inflation close to 3% +/- 1 pp by -2025.",
        "Factors such as a low exchange rate, reduced international price and cost pressures, moderate adjustments in food prices, and indexing to a lower inflation rate versus that of 2023 will all play a role in achieving this projected outcome.The 3.8% contraction in domestic demand in 2023 rectified the overspending relative to income seen in previous years.",
        "This adjustment not only helped alleviate inflationary pressures but also led to a substantial reduction in the current account deficit, from 6.2% of GDP in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023.",
        "This correction of the external imbalance has contributed to reducing the country's vulnerability to potential deteriorations in the global economic landscape.The Board members reached a consensus that the favorable trends in inflation and its expectations, coupled with a more sustainable external balance, create an advantageous environment for accelerating the pace of policy rate cuts.",
        "However, they cautioned that significant risks persist.",
        "The current level of observed inflation and its expectations continue far from the target.",
        "They highlighted uncertainties surrounding the extent of service price indexation and the lingering effects of the El Niño phenomenon, although both continue to fade.",
        "Moreover, they acknowledged the possibility of future challenges in international financial conditions.",
        "Given these considerations, they stressed the importance of caution in the magnitude of the monetary policy rate cut.",
        "Consequently, five directors voted in favor of a 50 basis-point reduction, one director supported a 75 basis-point cut, and one director advocated for a 100 basis-point decrease.The majority of directors advocating for a 50 basis-point cut highlighted several reasons supporting a faster reduction in the policy rate, alongside arguments for exercising caution during this process.",
        "They emphasized the positive trajectory of inflation in the first two months of the year, accentuating its continued decline as of 2023, in line with the expected convergence towards the target by -2025.",
        "Additionally, they pointed to the recent decrease in inflation, excluding food and regulated items, driven by favorable trends in goods prices.",
        "They also noted the stable exchange rate's role in lowering import prices, thus reducing producer costs and providing relief for consumers.",
        "Moreover, these directors highlighted that the significant drop in domestic demand, part of the broader macroeconomic adjustment, has disproportionately affected sectors like manufacturing, commerce, and construction.",
        "They maintained that these sectors would benefit from an interest rate cut, facilitating their recovery.",
        "Conversely, they underscored reasons for caution in the speed of monetary policy easing.",
        "They cautioned against sudden and unexpected interest rate cuts, which could fuel inflation expectations and currency depreciation, potentially jeopardizing the approximation to the inflation target and necessitating reversals with significant credibility costs.",
        "They also mentioned concerns about the anticipated deterioration in the fiscal position, citing warnings from the Autonomous Committee of the Fiscal Rule about compliance risks.",
        "Additionally, they pointed to market uncertainties stemming from high-level government announcements concerning political, economic, and social matters.",
        "They emphasized Colombia's fragile international standing, noting that events undermining fiscal sustainability or institutional stability could rapidly deteriorate the country’s risk and exchange rate, undermining confidence.The member advocating for a 75 basis-point reduction aligned with the Board's consensus in highlighting the ongoing decrease in both headline and core inflation, indicating the success of the contractionary policies initiated in September 2021.",
        "Diminishing inflation expectations across various time horizons sourced from surveys and debt markets in their view, instills a degree of confidence in achieving the target by -2025.",
        "Furthermore, the expected negative impact of the El Niño phenomenon on price appears to be waning.",
        "This confluence of lower inflation, favorable external conditions, reduced risk premiums for Colombia, a falling exchange rate, and the government's commitment to fiscal rule compliance presents a unique opportunity for a more substantial monetary policy rate cut.",
        "This would provide crucial stimulus to counteract the nearly 25% contraction in fixed investment witnessed in 2023.",
        "Failing to attain this aim could limit the potential for future economic growth and result in adverse effects on employment and income levels.Finally, the director supporting a 100 basis-point reduction in the policy rate emphasizes that the most substantial decrease in inflation has already occurred and that its rate of decline is expected to slow down moving forward.",
        "For this member, the risks associated with the El Niño phenomenon have diminished, and there is an expectation of a healthy agricultural supply in the upcoming months.",
        "Additionally, a crisis in power generation is not foreseen, given adequate water reserves backed by thermal generation, providing a buffer until rainfall patterns normalize.",
        "According to the director, the high energy tariffs in certain regions are mostly a result of market imperfections rather than energy shortages, suggesting that revising regulations could be a solution.",
        "The need to reach an agreement with transporters to determine an adjustment mechanism for diesel prices is also outstanding.",
        "In this context, the member does not foresee an immediate risk of inflationary pressures.",
        "On the contrary, concerns about the risks associated with low economic growth such as that forecast for 2024.",
        "Addressing these concerns would require a significant reduction in the real interest rate.",
        "However, the real (ex-post) intervention rate has increased this year due to a more significant decline in inflation compared to the cuts in the monetary policy rate and thereforethe director identifies an ample margin to implement a 100 basis-point cut in the interest rate to begin reducing the real interest rate effectively and stimulate economic growth recovery.The Board of Directors agrees that today’s decision accelerates the pace of interest rate cuts while asserting a policy stance in line with the objective of driving inflation to its target by -2025.",
        "The Board reiterates that future decisions will be taken considering new information.",
        "Annual inflation remained unchanged in May at 7.2%, while core inflation (excluding food or regulated items) fell from 6.4% to 6.1%.",
        "Annual food inflation was slightly higher than expected, increasing from 3% to 4.4%, owing to a rebound in the prices of some perishable foods whose impact from the El Niño phenomenon was more significant than anticipated.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation fell for the all sub-baskets of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) except food.According to the Bank’s monthly survey of economic analyst expectations performed in June, inflation expectations showed a decrease versus May readings.",
        "Results for one-year expectations for the sample median fell from 4.6% to 4.3% versus May, while yearend 2025 expectations remained stable at 3.8%.",
        "Inflation expectations obtained from the public debt market stood relatively unchanged, suggesting a downward trajectory over the policy horizon yet continuing    above the target until the end of 2025.The 0.9% annual GDP growth experienced in the first quarter exceeded the technical staff’s more conservative 0.3% forecast.",
        "During this period, net external demand was the primary driver of annual GDP growth due to the annual fall in imports and growth in exports.",
        "Second quarter results appear to point towards a recovery path for the economy according to indicators such as the economic tracking indicator (ISE) and other high-frequency indicators, including consumer credit disbursements, electronic payments, monthly exports and imports, regional pulse, cargo transport, and air passenger traffic.The country’s risk premium and the peso to US dollar exchange rate remained high over the past weeks mainly as a result of uncertainty regarding the inflation behavior in the United States and the Federal Reserve’s management of the interest rate, placing pressure on international financial markets and contributing to the strengthening of the US dollar worldwide.",
        "Domestically, amid a challenging backdrop for medium-term fiscal sustainability, the National Government announced a welcome public spending adjustment and commitment to comply with the fiscal rules.All Board of Directors members agree to continue with the process of decreasing the policy rate initiated last December, consistent with the downward trend annual inflation has upheld since April 2023.",
        "The directors agree that the restrictive monetary policy stance has fulfilled its objective of reducing excess spending in the economy, which, exacerbated by the multiple and persistent supply shocks that occurred since the pandemic, unleashed the strongest inflationary spiral the country has undergone since the adoption of the target inflation policy at the end of 1999.",
        "However, Board members continue to differ on the magnitude of said rate cuts they consider appropriate to bring inflation to target.",
        "This divide is mainly explained by the different weights Board members attach to the risks involved and the varying preferences concerning the particulars of the adjustment process.",
        "Nevertheless, all directors welcome the government’s recent fiscal efforts demonstrating a notable spending adjustment versus the behavior of 2023.",
        "At the recent meeting, four directors voted for a 50-basis point reduction in the policy rate, and two voted for a 75-basis point cut.The majority of directors that voted for a 50 bp decrease emphasized that this decision upholds the significant rate cut pace of the previous two Board sessions, positively reflected in the stability of inflation and inflation expectations seen in May and a similar decrease in the real interest rate, both ex-ante and ex-post.",
        "They consider that a steeper decline in the interest rate path is not sustainable over time, given the residual risks present to ensure the convergence of annual inflation to the target during the period anticipated by the Board.",
        "Among these risks, they highlight the downward stickiness of inflation in some services, including housing leases and electricity rates, and the peso’s depreciation against the US dollar in recent weeks.",
        "They underscore the risk surrounding food price inflation, which rebounded in May.",
        "In addition, they warn that while inflation expectations display a downward trend over time, they remain above the target for the relevant timeframe in which the Board aims to achieve its convergence to target.The Board members who voted for a 75 bp reduction agree with the majority in recognizing the risks that continue for the inflation path to converge to the target.",
        "However, they believe some to be more subdued.",
        "In the case of electricity rates, they emphasize that the risk of power outages has dissipated as hydro generation has been increasing and new solar plants are coming online.",
        "They note the upcoming rate option through which the government will assume the debt with the energy companies on the Atlantic coast for consumers in socioeconomic strata 1, 2, and 3.",
        "They also point out that many mechanisms for price indexing to the minimum wage have been eliminated since yearend 2022.",
        "On the other hand, these directors insist that the contractionary monetary policy has successfully reduced excess demand, and its snowballing effect will continue to bring inflation to the 3% target.",
        "They underscore that the 0.6% growth seen in 2023 fell below the most conservative forecasts, and the slowdown in consumption and the decrease in investment by more than 25% resulted in a significant correction of the current account deficit.",
        "They add that GDP data for the first quarter of 2024 showed domestic demand continued to negatively impact economic activity as household consumption fell (-0.1%) along with investment (-14.6%).",
        "Under these circumstances, they consider it essential to implement a less restrictive monetary policy through more significant rate cuts to drive investment recovery and, concurrently, enhance the prospects of growth closer to its potential in the coming years.",
        "They emphasize that Colombia’s investment rate fell from 23.4% of GDP in 2015 to its 18% rate, which places it at a level well below that of peer countries such as Mexico (24.7%), Peru (24%), and Chile (23.8%).The monetary policy decision adopted by the Board of Directors continues to support a stance seeking to drive inflation to its target by -2025, while providing a boost to further economic growth recovery.",
        "The Board of Directors underscored that future decisions will be determined based on new information available.__________________________________________________________________'One director was absent for legitimate reasons.",
        "In March, annual headline inflation reached 7.4%, completing 12 months of consecutive declines from its March 2023 peak of 13.3%.",
        "Likewise, inflation excluding food and regulated items significantly decreased and stood at 6.8% in March.",
        "The reduction in annual inflation was largely driven by decreases in the goods and food baskets.",
        "In contrast, inflation in the services and regulated items component continues to show relative downward rigidity.Inflation’s observed descending path has been reflected in a downward revision of inflation expectations over the past year, corroborated by various measures.",
        "Viewed at the margin, the sample median drawn from Banco de la República’s monthly survey of economic analysts between March and April maintained their one- and two-year inflation expectations stable at 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.",
        "Expectations drawn from public debt markets mostly decreased, though they continued at levels above the inflation target.The recent performance of the Economic Monitoring Indicator (ISE) during the initial months of the year reflects the positive performance of the primary sector driven by an increase in agricultural supply and mining, further supported by some tertiary sector activities such as health, education, and entertainment.",
        "Consequently, the technical staff revised their economic growth projection upward for 2024 to 1.4% from the 1.1% forecast in March.",
        "For 2025, the technical staff estimates a 3.2% growth, with consumption continuing to improve and investment recovering from the low levels seen in 2024.Seasonally adjusted unemployment figures, though relatively stable, denote a slight upward trend in the national unemployment rate and in the thirteen main cities, both falling at close to 11%.",
        "Nevertheless, despite recent increases in the unemployment rate, it remains at similar levels to those observed pre-pandemic.Economic conditions in the United States, characterized by persistent above-target core inflation, a tight labor market, and upward revisions in economic growth projections, have contributed to increases in medium- and long-term interest rates in global markets, implying potentially less favorable external conditions for the country.The Board of Directors reached a unanimous decision to lower interest rates to support economic recovery and address inflation, which is effectively decreasing and approaching the target.",
        "They noted that the concern of a significant impact on food or power costs by the El Niño phenomenon has been waning.",
        "They pointed out that the positive behavior of goods prices has contributed to a noticeable decrease in inflation excluding food and regulated items.",
        "They warned that the labor market, although exhibiting favorable behavior up to the third quarter of 2023, has begun to show signs of deterioration.",
        "Consequently, they pointed out that, in the first quarter of 2024, salaried employment stagnated while informal employment grew, indicating lower job generation activity and a decline in job quality.",
        "They stressed that the drop in aggregate demand has primarily impacted the manufacturing, trade, and housing construction sectors, which are adversely affected by interest rates and other factors that undermine the investment climate.",
        "The differences among the directors arose primarily from differing outlooks on the manner in which they interpreted the economic environment and inherent risks.",
        "Five directors voted for a 50 basis-point cut of the benchmark policy rate, one director opted for a 75 basis-point decrease, and one backed a 100 basis-point reduction.The board members who voted for a 50-bps reduction consider it appropriate to maintain the pace of policy rate cuts in line with the previous meeting, which they judged to be a substantial reduction.",
        "In this regard, they point out that a 50-bps reduction in the policy rate implies that the ex-ante real interest rate - most significant for investment decisions - will continue its downward trend.",
        "Acknowledging that favorable conditions exist for further monetary policy easing, this group of directors warns that international financial conditions have been becoming less favorable, as shown by increases in long-term U treasury bond interest rates and the increased likelihood that the U Federal Reserve will postpone its interest rate cuts.",
        "This has been reflected in the fall in the value of  zero-coupon TES bonds in an environment of higher volatility and lower liquidity, while the appreciation tendency of the peso to the US dollar seen since last year has ameliorated.",
        "They note that, under these conditions, aggressive policy rate reductions generate abrupt exchange rate increases that could have undesirable impacts on inflation’s downward path and place a burden on public debt.",
        "They highlight that a larger-than-expected reduction in the policy rate might lead to some reversal in the market’s re-anchoring of expectations or reinforce somewhat the recent weakening experienced by financial markets.",
        "Some of the directors in this cohort warn that the expected increase in the National Government’s deficit over one GDP point in 2024 could delay the convergence of inflation towards its target within the time frame anticipated by the Board of Directors.",
        "Thus, special care needs to be taken regarding the extent of monetary policy rate cuts.The director who opted for a 75-bps decrease mostly agreed with the majority group's diagnosis regarding the favorable conditions that support continuing the interest rate cuts initiated in December.",
        "However, they consider it possible to speed up the pace of interest rate cuts without risking the progress achieved towards lowering inflation.",
        "In their view, reversing the sharp decline in investment is a priority that requires a larger policy rate cut, which can serve as a positive signal to investors.",
        "Along this line, many business executives consulted underscore the paralysis seen in financial closings for projects owing to high interest rate levels.",
        "Amid this backdrop, an additional interest rate cut could contribute to creating a more favorable atmosphere for investment and support further growth.Finally, the director who voted for a 100-bps decrease emphasized that monetary policy continues to be highly restrictive despite the interest rate cuts made by the Board of Directors so far.",
        "In their opinion, what is now required is prioritizing the reactivation of the economy.",
        "This, among its multiple benefits, would contribute to increasing tax revenues and strengthening the country's public finances.With today's decision, the Board continues with growth-enhancing policy rate cuts while maintaining a policy stance in line with the objective of driving inflation to its target by -2025.",
        "The Board reiterates that future decisions will be taken considering new information as it becomes available."

    "2023": [
        "In its policy discussion, the Board considered the following elements:The slowdown in economic activity which was noticeable as of the fourth quarter of 2022 has continued through to the first months of 2023, albeit at a slower pace than expected.",
        "This can be identified in the economic monitoring indicator (ISE in Spanish), with a drop in the annual change from 5.8% in January to 3.1% in February.",
        "This trend is mirrored by other leading indicators such as energy demand, vehicle registrations, imports in dollars and the loan portfolio, which have been recording low and, in some cases, negative growth.",
        "Based on this information, the technical staff increased its GDP growth forecast to 1% for 2023, meaning that the economy continues to maintain the high output level reached in 2022, with a moderate expansion this year.The annual   inflation in March remained relatively stable, at a level slightly above the 13% annual rate that has been noted since December.",
        "This behavior reflects in part the decline of annual food inflation, which between February and March fell from 24.1% to 21.8%, in a context of good supply and reduced import costs.",
        "Conversely, services such as health, transportation, and recreation, among others, have continued to push inflation upwards, which was reflected in the 47 bps increase in core inflation excluding food and regulated items seen in March.",
        "Nonetheless, annual producer price inflation, which contracted in March for the fifth consecutive month, indicates that cost pressures are easing and signals that consumer inflation will begin to decline in the coming months.Total inflation expectations for one-year and longer-term horizons have begun to fall but remain above target.",
        "The Monthly Expectations Survey (EME in Spanish) of economic analysts conducted by Banco de la República in April indicated that the median of twelve-month expectations fell from 7.2% to 7.0%, remaining at 5.0% for yearend   2024, with two-year ahead expectation at 4.0%.",
        "However, inflation expectations for yearend 2023 increased according to the survey, from 9.0% to 9.3% for headline inflation and from 8.7% to 9.4% for non-food inflation.The technical staff expects the current account deficit to narrow from 6.2% of GDP in 2022 to 4.1% by the end of 2023.",
        "The moderation of the external imbalance would primarily be attributed to a weakening in domestic demand, which is already noted in the drop in imports.",
        "Additionally, the declines in factor income seen would be less negative as profits remitted abroad by companies with FDI in Colombia would be lower.",
        "This is due in part because the 2022 tax reform increased the tax rates for oil and coal producing companies when international commodity prices exceeded a certain threshold, as was the case.The U Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank raised their policy interest rates again in the face of persistently high inflation levels, and slightly higher rates are now expected over the forecast horizon.",
        "The steeper cost of global financing, the erosion of real income due to high levels of global inflation and ongoing geopolitical tensions will continue to impact the world economy and could slow external demand.",
        "The extent of the risks from the recent bank failures in the United States and Europe continues to be relevant for the global economy.Colombia's favorable assessment under Article of the the IMF and the most recent ratification that the country meets eligibility conditions for access to the Flexible Credit Line, an instrument available only to countries with strong macroeconomic policy frameworks, is an acknowledgment of Colombia's prudent economic policy management and contributes to improving market confidence.Based on these considerations and other relevant issues regarding the current economic situation and its outlook, all members of the BDBR agreed on the need to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance to enable inflation to converge toward its target.",
        "Although the directors are confident that inflation will soon begin to ease, divergent opinions regarding the policy rate adjustment led four directors to vote in favor of a 25 bps interest rate increase, two directors to hold the rate unchanged, and one director voted for a 50 bps increase.The Directors with the majority vote acknowledge that policy rate increases effects on aggregate demand are becoming evident, as shown by the leading indicators mentioned above.",
        "However, they emphasize that inflation has not yet begun to decline, unlike in most Latin American countries.",
        "In particular, they point out that the core inflation continues to be high and on an upward trajectory.",
        "They underline that, although the measures of inflation expectations for terms above a one-year horizon show downward adjustments, those for yearend 2023 for both headline and non-food inflation continue high and on an ascendant path, which contributes to upholding price indexation mechanisms.",
        "Moreover, a member of this group stated that although there is a fiscal adjustment taking place, which contributes to reducing excess demand and the current account imbalance, there continues to be significant fiscal pressure which limits the opportunity for a less contractionary monetary policy.The Directors who voted to keep the policy rate unchanged, at its 13% level, consider this to already be a contractionary stance since its actual real level has been situated for several months above the neutral interest rate calculated by the technical staff.",
        "This stance has already had obvious effects by weakening aggregate demand and decelerating economic activity, as confirmed by numerous leading indicators.",
        "In these circumstances, they prefer to wait for the full impact that the 11.25 percentage point increase in the aggregate policy rate since September 2021 will have on the economy.",
        "In this regard, they recall that transmission lags in monetary policy changes are normal.",
        "Likewise, they highlight that, by 2023, a partial correction of external and fiscal imbalances is projected, which would lead to lower demand pressures.",
        "They emphasize that food inflation corrections have already begun and will possibly continue with the improvement in weather conditions that contribute to increasing the food supply.",
        "They emphasize that the observed decrease in the producer price index, both in its local and imported components, points to lessening cost pressures, which creates favorable conditions for consumer inflation to begin to decline.The Director who voted for a 50 bps increase highlights that headline inflation, as well as core inflation, remain elevated, while the latter continues to show significant increases such as those that occurred in March, when it rose 47 bps, driven by price indexation.",
        "This characteristic makes this core inflation measure less sensitive to interest rate increases.",
        "In this regard, he expressed concern about the behavior of non-food inflation expectations for the end of 2023.",
        "Furthermore, he noted that the current account deficit of 6.2% as a proportion of GDP at the end of 2022 and its projection of 4.1% for 2023 continues to be a considerable external imbalance, which requires hastening the adjustment process of the Colombian economy.",
        "In his opinion, a more gradual policy would result in a protracted period of high monetary policy rates that would undoubtedly impact the country's growth capacity.The Board of Directors highlighted that the decision adopted is consistent with the objective of driving inflation toward the 3% target over the forecast horizon and that future decisions will be determined according to new information available.",
        "Five Directors voted in favor of this decision, and two voted for a 25 basis-point reduction.",
        "In its policy discussion, the Board of Directors considered the following elements:In September, both headline (11.0%) and core (9.5%) inflation continued to decline, as compared to previous months, albeit less than anticipated, remaining well above the target.",
        "Annual inflation of goods (10.4%) and food prices (11.5%) decreased since August; however, the inflation rate for services (9.1%) and regulated items (15.8%) remained stable.Inflation expectations derived from the government debt securities markets have increased for all maturities and remain above the target.",
        "On the other hand, according to surveys conducted by the Bank, headline inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 increased, while expectations for inflation excluding food exhibited mixed behavior.",
        "Increases in inflation expectations are associated, among other factors, with perceived risks such as the El Niño phenomenon, the decision to establish the minimum wage above the observed inflation, and the necessary adjustments to fuel prices.",
        "Additionally, the appreciation of the Colombian peso to the US dollar in October, driven by changes in international financial conditions, could have also affected inflation expectations.The Bank’s technical staff forecasts a 0.4% annual economic activity growth during the third quarter of the year, while expected growth for 2023 was revised upward from 0.9% to 1.2%.",
        "While these growth rates represent a substantial deceleration relative to previous years, economic activity levels remain high, and unemployment has reached historic lows amidst robust labor participation rates.",
        "Sectoral performance has been irregular, with stagnation or decline in primary and secondary sectors and growth in the tertiary sector.",
        "On the demand side, there have been declines in both investment and the consumption of durable and semi-durable goods, in contrast with higher service-related consumption.",
        "The decline in investment has played a pivotal role in the marked reduction of imports and the narrowing of the current account deficit.Despite the efforts to address the external imbalances within the economy, there is a growing perception of heightened external risks.",
        "On the one hand, the technical staff has revised the projected path of interest rates in developed markets upward.",
        "This upside adjustment, driven by enduring global inflation pressures, tightens financing conditions for the Colombian economy.",
        "On the other hand, international political instability fosters additional uncertainty within financial markets, potentially leading to ramifications in the foreign exchange market due to shifts in capital flows and commodity prices.In their analysis, the Directors acknowledge the inflationary challenges the Colombian economy will encounter in the upcoming year.",
        "They emphasize domestic risks stemming from the rising likelihood of a strongEl Niñophenomenon, which could impact agricultural and energy markets.",
        "Additionally, they anticipate repercussions from the minimum wage increase on the indexed prices of specific goods and services.",
        "Furthermore, they perceive global political uncertainty as a new external risk factor.The Directors are also mindful of the potential impact of interest rates on economic activity and the associated risks.",
        "Consequently, they concur on the desirability of commencing a process to gradually lower the intervention interest rate as soon as it is prudent.In this particular context, five Directors voted to keep the intervention rate steady at its current level of 13.25%, and two Directors voted in favor of a 25 basis points reduction that would bring the rate to 13%.",
        "The decision by the Directors reflects the weight they assign to the risk factors mentioned above.The majority faction, which opted for maintaining the existing rate, underscores the prevalence of inflationary risks.",
        "To the extent these risks influence inflation expectations and reduce the anticipated real interest rate, thereby tempering the contractionary aspect of monetary policy, thus leading to increased costs in the endeavor to bring inflation back in line with the target.",
        "The decision to maintain the current rate unchanged serves to contain inflation expectations and safeguard the Bank's credibility.A director within the majority group also noted that the urgency of reducing the intervention rate has been offset partially by the reductions observed since August in CDT interest rates and lending rates in the credit markets.",
        "These reductions are partly a response to the liquidity injections provided byBanco de la Repúblicaover the past few months, specifically in three and six-month maturities.The two Directors who voted for a 25 basis point reduction in the intervention rate consider that the rate increases have contributed to closing the output gap and will continue to do so until demand-induced pressures on prices within the economy are entirely alleviated.",
        "They emphasize the external and fiscal adjustments made by the economy over the past year, which have rendered it less susceptible to vulnerabilities.",
        "While they do not dispute the existence of inflationary risks acknowledged by the other Directors, they consider these risks relatively minor compared to the downside risk facing economic activity and employment.",
        "This concern particularly pertains to the impact of interest rates on investment projects.All members of the BDBR unanimously concurred on an appeal for prudence in determining the minimum wage for the year 2024.",
        "In this context, they note the decrease in inflation from 2022 to 2023 has led to a substantial increase in real wages throughout this year, which will be reinforced further by the anticipated inflation reduction in 2024.The Directors reiterated their unwavering commitment to achieving the 3% inflation target while carefully weighing the repercussions of their decisions on both economic activity and employment rates.",
        "Furthermore, they affirmed that forthcoming decisions will be taken considering any new information.",
        "Annual inflation in June stood at 12.1%, one percentage point below that recorded in December 2022.",
        "The decrease in inflation has slowed the pace of inflation expectations.",
        "The survey of economic analysts for July showed that, according to the sample median, inflation expectations for the 12- and 24-month forward horizon currently stand at 6.0% and 3.9%, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, inflation expectations derived from the government debt securities (TES) market for the two- and five-year ahead horizons, controlling for liquidity and inflationary premium risks, stand at between 5.6% and 4.6%.",
        "Despite these improvements, inflation levels and expectations continue to surpass the target, as seen in the inflation expectation for 2024, which stands at 5.0%.",
        "In addition, the steadfast position of core inflation (excluding food and regulated items) persists, which stood at an annual 10.5% in June, a level similar to that observed in the preceding months.",
        "Indexation processes continue, which helps to explain this behavior.",
        "•The economic monitoring indicator (ISE) for April and May, as well as the latest industry and trade survey, suggest that the slowdown in economic activity in the second quarter would have been greater than expected.",
        "Consequently, the technical staff slightly reduced its growth forecast for 2023 from 1% to 0.9%, placing it at a level below those of most economic analysts.",
        "Moreover, the expectation for 2024 was revised slightly upwards, from 0.9 to 1%.",
        "Although these increments appear small, they align with historically high product levels that reflect marginal variations of significant GDP expansions that occurred in 2021 and 2022.",
        "Despite showing signs of a possible slowdown, the labor market continues to perform well.",
        "This was supported by the latest DANE labor market report, which noted a fall in the national aggregate unemployment rate in June to 9.3%, and 8.8% for the thirteen main cities.",
        "Credit growth has slowed.",
        "In -July, the total loan and consumption portfolio grew at annual rates of 9% and 5% respectively, rates considerably lower than those observed to September 2022.",
        "A relative worsening in the quality of the loan portfolio has occurred, mainly in consumption.",
        "Nevertheless, credit institutions maintain high levels of capital and a sound liquidity position, acting within the framework of a regulatory system that upholds high international standards.",
        "The Colombian peso has continued to appreciate, returning to levels not seen since -2022.",
        "The appreciation of the peso has occurred against a backdrop of lower country risk premiums, to a far greater degree than those observed in other regional economies.",
        "In their policy discussion, the directors weighed the positive recent behavior of inflation and other macroeconomic variables against those that remain a cause for concern.",
        "Among the first, the directors highlighted the downward path of consumer price inflation seen in the past three consecutive months and highlighted the sharp drop in producer price inflation that underlines a reduction in the growth rate of production costs.",
        "They stressed that inflation expectations for various forward-looking periods have continued to decrease, including for yearend 2023.",
        "They also highlighted the remarkable appreciation of the peso in recent months, which they associate with positive risk level signals, which they considered favorable for the deflationary process and convergence to the inflation target.",
        "They emphasized that the lower growth of credit and monetary aggregates reinforce the downward adjustment in the excess aggregate demand.",
        "Likewise, they underlined the progress made in reducing the current account of the balance of payments, to head it toward more sustainable levels.",
        "They underscore the National Government's purpose to reduce its fiscal deficit by one GDP point in 2023.",
        "They stressed that, despite the slowdown in economic activity so far this year, the labor market remains strong.",
        "The directors emphasize that these favorable indicators reaffirm the strength of the financial system, despite the deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio associated with the slowdown in economic activity and high interest rates.",
        "Financial regulation in Colombia, following the highest international standards, plays an important role in this regard, and they emphasized there is no dilemma between price stability and financial stability.",
        "As for the factors that remain a cause for concern, the directors highlighted that, despite the fall in inflation during the past three months, it continues to register a significantly high level, relative to that observed both in the main advanced economies and in comparable Latin American economies.",
        "They caution that they have not begun to observe in Colombia a reduction of the customary indicator of core inflation, defined as the CPI basket excluding food or regulated items, which to June remained at a level of 10.5%, the highest in this century.",
        "They stressed that inflation expectations for various forward-looking periods continue at levels well above the 3% target despite recent decreases.",
        "They noted the risks associated with future movements of the exchange rate, given the global and local uncertainty that prevails.",
        "They mentioned the concerns about the potential effects the El Niño phenomenon may have on food and energy prices, as well as new shocks arising from the possible escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and the expiration of deals allowing the export of grains and other agricultural products from this region.",
        "They pointed out that the increases in fuel prices, required to close the deficit resulting from their prolonged stagnancy, will continue to drive up the regulated basket and inflation in general.",
        "In this regard, they indicated the food inflation decline has so far offset the higher inflation for regulated items, but the effects of El Niño or the war in Ukraine could potentially reverse this achievement, in an environment in which core inflation continues unyielding.",
        "Thus, they underscored that the fight against inflation is not over, and thus agreed on the need to maintain the current restrictive monetary policy stance until they see definitive signs of convergence of inflation towards its target.",
        "After a conscientious risk assessment, the directors unanimously agreed to keep the policy interest rate unchanged.",
        "At the same time, they insisted that the successive decisions taken by the Board will be determined according to new information available.",
        "Five Board Members voted in favor of this decision, and two voted for a 25 bp increase.In their policy discussion, the Board of Directors considered the following elements:In December, both headline inflation (13.1%) and core inflation (excluding food and regulated items, 9.5%) continued their upward trend as a result of a monthly inflation of 1.3% that was higher than the technical staff (0.5%) and the market (median of 0.8%) expected.",
        "The surge in inflation was due to upward pressure on food prices, indexation at high inflation rates, and the cumulative effects of the depreciation of the peso along several other factors.",
        "In line with this result, inflation expectations were revised upwards, both for 2023 and for 2- and 5-year horizons.Economic activity began to show signs of a slowdown as of the fourth quarter of 2022, as deduced from leading indicators such as demand for energy, transaction figures, and consumer credit disbursements.",
        "The Economic Monitoring Indicator (ISE) registered an annual change of 2.9% in November, which was lower than October's (4.4%), and what was expected by the technical staff (4.0%).",
        "Nevertheless, GDP levels remain high, for which reason by 2022 it is estimated that the economy would have achieved growth of 8.0%.",
        "The slowdown in economic activity is expected to deepen.",
        "The technical staff is forecasting a 0.2% GDP growth figure for 2023.Inflation in the United States and Europe has shown a faster-than-expected decline as a result of the monetary policy tightening process and the mitigation of supply shocks.",
        "This will possibly allow for a less restrictive monetary policy path in these regions.",
        "Moreover, the relaxation of sanitary restrictions in China could translate into higher growth in that country and in an increased demand for basic goods, including oil.",
        "The improvement in the foreign environment and confidence in Colombia's fiscal outlook have been reflected in an appreciation of the COP/USD exchange rate.In line with the transmission of increases in monetary policy interest rates to market rates, total credit growth and, particularly pronounced, consumer credit growth, have been slackening since the fourth quarter of last year.",
        "Over the last month the growth of all portfolios has declined (with seasonally adjusted figures).",
        "This favors a moderation in domestic demand and inflationary pressures in 2023.In the context described, the seven members of the Board of Directors agreed on the need for a new increase in the policy interest rate as to get inflation back to its 3.0% target in the medium term.",
        "They stressed the fact that the latest news on the inflationary front was not encouraging.",
        "The actual inflation in December for all baskets was higher than the technical staff and analysts had expected, while inflation expectations for most maturities continued to rise.",
        "This is in a context in which the slowdown in global economic activity has been slower than projected and in which there is renewed optimism among foreign investors regarding emerging economies.",
        "In the case of Colombia, this optimism was reflected in the successful placements of sovereign and Ecopetrol bonds in international markets and in reductions in the risk premia that were more pronounced than those of its regional peers.",
        "However, due to different emphases regarding the trends of the main macroeconomic variables, there was divergence with respect to the amount of the required adjustment.",
        "Five Board Members voted for a 75 bp increase, and two voted for an increase of 25 bp.Among the arguments of the majority group, the multiple inflationary risks that still exist were highlighted including the indexation of prices to either the minimum wage or the latest inflation data.",
        "This with the aggravating factor that much of the inflation is caused at the beginning of the year.",
        "They also warned that the ongoing high inflation expectations make it necessary to adjust the real interest rate to preserve the contractionary monetary policy stance.",
        "It was also noted that, despite the appreciation of the peso seen in recent weeks, the inflationary trend has been reinforced by the accumulated depreciation of the peso, which has been close to 15% in the last 12 months.",
        "For this group of Board Directors, reaffirming Banco de la República's commitment to the inflation target through a 75 bp increase will contribute to the peso's recovery process with beneficial effects on inflation.",
        "Finally, from a different perspective, a member of this group highlighted the decline in the indicators of the main monetary aggregates as a percentage of GDP and warned about the possibility that this may reflect a decrease in the demand for money.",
        "This leads economic agents to prefer foreign assets, durable consumer goods, or consumption, which could be an additional factor of upward pressure on price levels.",
        "The weakness in the demand for monetary assets seems to reflect the structure of deposit interest rates.Board Members who voted for a 25 bp increase emphasized that the signs of a slowing economic growth justify a more moderate increase in the policy rate.",
        "They emphasized that the demand in the economy entered contractionary territory in November and December, as can be deduced from various indicators such as retail sales, fuel consumption, automobile sales, and the behavior of imports.",
        "The latter have registered consecutive drops for several months and fell in December, according to the information from the DIAN.",
        "They insisted that if the objective of monetary policy was to reduce demand in the economy, this has already been achieved, and forecasts indicate that its effects on economic growth in the coming year will be significant.",
        "They expressed the need to preserve the recovery of employment and noted that recent labor market indicators are highly sensitive to the slowdown in economic activity.",
        "They added that monetary and credit indicators confirm a decline in economic activity as evidenced by the lower growth rates of monetary aggregates and the loss of strength in the loan portfolio.",
        "They stressed that the persistence of inflation, despite historically high increases in the policy interest rate, demonstrates that the origin of the inflationary phenomenon has been essentially supply-side and mainly associated with food supply.",
        "This has been compounded by exchange rate pressure, which, together with the increase in international prices, has increased the cost of imported inputs, but they emphasized that this pressure has been decreasing since November.",
        "Price indexation has been another supply factor that has accentuated the inflationary trend.Finally, the Board of Directors agreed that after the trajectory of interest rate increases in 2022 and with the decision adopted on this occasion, monetary policy is close to the stance required to induce a convergence of inflation towards its 3.0% target in the medium term.",
        "They reiterated that in the context of high uncertainty, further decisions will critically depend on the new information available.",
        "Inflation remains on a downward path, falling for eight consecutive months and reaching 10.15% in November.",
        "The decrease in the annual food inflation from 10.36% in October to 8.25% in November substantially contributed to moderating headline inflation.",
        "In particular, the significant drop in annual inflation for perishable foods, decreasing to 7.8% in November after maintaining levels at around 13% in preceding months, is worth noting.",
        "The positive impact of lower food inflation was partially offset by higher annual inflation in regulated items, reaching 16.9% in November, attributed to increases in fuel and energy prices.",
        "Furthermore, between June and November, annual core inflation, excluding food and regulated items, registered a consistent monthly decrease, dropping from 10.51% to 8.86% year-over-year.Inflation expectations at different horizons showed mixed results.",
        "The sample median of economic analysts surveyed by Banco de la República increased their forecast for the end of 2024 from 5.2% in November to 5.7% in December but maintained their two- and five-year inflation expectations stable at 3.8% and 3%.",
        "Expectations for two-year inflation derived from TES markets, factoring in inflation and liquidity premium, underwent a notable trend reversal in the last quarter, declining from 6.1% to 5.4% between October and December.Economic activity continues to decelerate.",
        "The economic tracking indicator (ISE) showed an annual change of -0.4% in October.",
        "Secondary activities, encompassing manufacturing industries and construction, witnessed the most substantial declines.",
        "Meanwhile, within the tertiary sector, notable setbacks in September were observed in the macro-sectors of trade, transportation, and lodging, as well as in the public administration, health, and education sectors.",
        "The technical staff revised its growth forecast for 2023 downward from 1.2% to 1.0%, returning to the economic activity projection it had maintained until this past August.Adjustment in the country’s economic activity toward levels more compatible with the economy’s productive capacity has contributed to reducing the current account deficit of the balance of payments.",
        "On a quarterly basis, it fell to 1.7% of GDP in the third quarter of 2023, a notable contrast to the 7.1% of GDP recorded during the same quarter in 2022.",
        "Over the entire year, the forecast places it at 2.8% of GDP for 2023, from the 6.2% deficit observed in 2022.",
        "This significant correction in the external imbalance is primarily attributed to a substantial decrease in imports linked to adjustments in domestic demand.",
        "Additionally, the improvement in net factor income, reflective of diminished profits remitted abroad by foreign-invested companies within the country, contributes to this positive trend.",
        "The strengthening of the country’s external position resulting from the reduction of this deficit renders the economy less vulnerable to potential downturns in global economic conditions.External financial conditions and their outlook have improved against a backdrop of declining, albeit still high, global inflation levels.",
        "In the case of the United States, the most recent projections suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank’s policy interest rate path will adopt a lower trend than previously expected.",
        "In this context, the Colombian peso appreciated against the US dollar, and Colombia’s sovereign risk premium decreased, achieving its lowest level in the past 18 months.Board members underscored that the contractionary stance of monetary policy has played a pivotal role in mitigating the accrued macroeconomic imbalances of recent years.",
        "The tempering of domestic demand to levels compatible with productive capacity has been instrumental in establishing a foundation for diminishing inflation and fostering a more sustainable external position.",
        "To consolidate these advances, the directors emphasized the need for monetary policy to continue focusing on ensuring the convergence of inflation towards the target and achieving sustainable levels of output.Furthermore, directors stressed the presence of significant risks on the policy horizon.",
        "The most immediate concern revolves around the uncertainty regarding the increase in the minimum wage for 2024 in an economy as intricately indexed as Colombia's.",
        "Likewise, attention was drawn to the inherent risks associated with the El Niño phenomenon and its potential impact on food and energy prices, the elimination of the subsidy on diesel fuel, and the imposition of taxes on ultra-processed foods.",
        "Taking these considerations into account, five directors voted for a 25-basis-point reduction in the policy interest rate, while two directors voted to keep it unchanged at the current level of 13.25%.The directors who voted for a 25-basis-point reduction articulated the rationale, deeming it timely and imperative to adopt this decision in the present circumstances.",
        "Concurrently, they acknowledged the persisting risks and uncertainties on the inflationary and macroeconomic fronts, underscoring the need for meticulous consideration in future decisions.",
        "They cautioned against interpreting this decision as the commencement of an uninterrupted cycle of policy interest rate cuts, emphasizing that each decision will be scrutinized in due time based on the latest available information.",
        "Their emphasis on proceeding with a moderate interest rate reduction rested on various justifications.",
        "Notably, they pointed out the consistent decline in both headline and core inflation for eight consecutive months since July, showcasing the efficacy of monetary policy in curbing demand excesses.",
        "They anticipated this effect to persist, steering inflation convergence toward the target within a 12 to 18-month horizon, as outlined in the Board's November session.",
        "Furthermore, they highlighted a downward adjustment in inflation expectations implicit in the prices of the public debt market since October.",
        "The November decrease in the producer price index and the substantial contraction of aggregate demand by 6.8% in the third quarter, resulting in a 0.3% GDP contraction during the same period, were underscored.",
        "This trend appeared to persist into October, evidenced by a 0.4% decline in the ISE in that month.",
        "The directors also noted the emerging impacts of the recent economic contraction on the labor market, with seasonally adjusted data revealing an increase in the national unemployment rate from a low of 9.3% in August to 9.9% in October.",
        "In parallel, they drew attention to the greater-than-expected adjustment in the current account deficit of the balance of payments, mitigating the country's macroeconomic vulnerability and facilitating in making more more viable the reduction in the interest rate.",
        "Finally, they highlighted the recent improvements in external financial conditions.",
        "In conjunction with the smaller external imbalance, this has contributed to a reduction in the country's risk premium and a revaluation of the exchange rate.Members of the Board who voted to maintain the interest rate unchanged underscored the presence of uncertainties that warrant prudence.",
        "Consequently, they recommended preserving the stability of the monetary policy rate.",
        "Their emphasis on caution stemmed from apprehensions regarding the recent trajectory of inflation expectations, notably those derived from economic analysts, which exhibited an uptick in December surveys for year-end 2024.",
        "They drew attention to the escalation in inflation excluding food in November, registering an annual rate of 10.61% compared to October's 10.51%.",
        "They accentuated the uncertainty that surrounds making a decision of such magnitude, vulnerable to the surprise that could result from an excessively elevated minimum wage increase.",
        "Furthermore, they added that, despite the ongoing reduction in inflation, the pace of decline has been gradual, suggesting an erosion in the credibility of monetary policy that could be further jeopardized by a premature reduction in the interest rate.",
        "Concerns were also voiced regarding the fiscal plan for the upcoming years and the government's adherence to the current fiscal rule.Finally, the directors unanimously reiterated their call for restraint in the upcoming adjustment of the minimum wage, urging that any increase should not significantly exceed the annual change in the Consumer Price Index for 2023.",
        "The latter considering the purchasing power gains seen in 2023 and expected for 2024 resulting from the expected drop in inflation.",
        "In August, headline inflation stood at 0.7%, above that expected by the technical staff and the market analysts (0.5%).",
        "Annual headline inflation came in at 11.4% and core inflation (excluding food and regulated items) at 9.9%.",
        "Although both inflation measures continued on a downward trajectory, they so at a slower pace than anticipated and remain well above the target.",
        "The slower inflationary easing was explained by the behavior of food prices, mainly a rebound in the perishables segment, as well as by the price indexation mechanisms that led to the persistence of high inflation.",
        "However, most of the drop in inflation since April is reflected in the overall decrease in food inflation.Inflation expectations had mixed reactions.",
        "The survey of economic analysts for September showed a slight increase in their inflation expectations for year-end 2024, with the sample median moving from 4.9% to 5%.",
        "However, these fell over the two-year horizon from 4% to 3.9%.",
        "Expectations drawn from the financial markets for 1, 5, and 8 years forward, adjusted for the inflation risk premium, were revised upward and stood at 5.2%, 4.6%, and 4.2% respectively.",
        "These revisions occurred against a backdrop of lower-paced inflationary decreases and expected inflation risks primarily associated with the El Niño phenomenon, fuel price adjustments, and continued indexation processes.Economic activity continued to decelerate, consistent with the technical staff’s projections.",
        "This is confirmed by high-frequency indicators whose demand components register a steep drop in investment, while supply-side activities presenting the greatest adjustment include manufacturing and construction.",
        "However, in the aggregate, economic activity continues at higher levels than those that would have been observed had the pre-pandemic growth trend continued.",
        "This is reflected in a dynamic job market that continues to register employment growth, with unemployment rates below those of the past five years, according to the August information published by DANE.In response to the adjustments of domestic demand, the country's external imbalance narrowed to 3% of GDP in the second quarter, from 4.2% in the previous quarter and 6.2% in 2022.",
        "This correction largely reflects a decrease in imports from the high levels recorded in 2022, lower profits remitted abroad by companies with foreign direct investment (FDI), and a rebound in tourism-related service exports.",
        "The decrease in the current account deficit improves the country's external position and decreases the vulnerability of the economy to significant global deterioration.The Board underscores that high inflation increases economic costs in terms of growth and equity, making long-term financing for both the public and private sectors more difficult.",
        "In addition, it introduces distortions in the allocation of resources and generates redistributions that are detrimental to the lower-income strata of the population.",
        "To this effect, the Constitutional Court in its 1999 ruling stated that the obligation of Banco de la República to preserve the purchasing power of the currency must consider the other economic objectives of the Government’s intervention, such as economic growth and employment.",
        "The fulfillment of this mandate requires achieving sustainable growth with price stability.",
        "This long-term objective of monetary policy requires that inflationary shocks, such as the current ones, must be addressed in a timely manner.Under the conditions of a largely anticipated slowdown in economic activity, the Directors shared the overall objective of finding the best opportunity to initiate an interest rate reduction process.",
        "In this context, five Directors voted to leave the policy rate unchanged at its current level of 13.25%, and two Directors voted to reduce it by 25 basis points.Those Directors who opted to leave the interest rate unchanged acknowledged that the monetary tightening carried out so far has substantially moderated the excess demand that prevailed in 2022; normalized credit growth, particularly consumer credit; and brought about a significant reduction in the current account balance deficit.",
        "All of this represents significant progress in the requisite economic adjustment and has considerably reduced the macroeconomic stability risks.",
        "However, they warn that both headline and core inflation figures continue at excessively high levels, in contrast with what has been occurring in the main advanced countries as well as in comparable Latin American economies, which have been able to begin lowering their interest rates.",
        "They add that inflation expectations continue far removed from the 3% target, which encourages price indexation mechanisms reflected, for instance, in the CPI services basket, whose annual inflation remains above 9% and refuses to fall.",
        "They warn there are significant risks that may affect inflation in Colombia during the coming months, such as the materialization of a strong El Niño phenomenon that may push up food and energy prices; the possibility of higher interest rates in the main developed economies (the United States and the eurozone) that may drive investment capital out of the country and encourage exchange rate depreciation trends; and rises in oil prices, such as those recently experienced, which may accentuate the need to continue increasing fuel prices.",
        "Given these circumstances, these Directors considered the conditions were not suitable for an interest rate decrease, and a premature decision would risk a future reversal at great cost to the credibility of monetary policy and to the process of bringing inflation toward the established target.",
        "These Directors also noted that monetary policy foresees a longer horizon within its objectives and implementation, thus implying it must steadfastly maintain its objective of returning to the 3% target in order to provide Colombia with greater macroeconomic stability.Those Directors who voted for a 25 bp policy rate reduction not deviate substantially from the abovementioned majority group's concerns regarding the persistence of inflation, its unrelenting elevated level and expectations, and the inflationary pressures contingencies.",
        "However, their reading of the indicators and their outlook inclines them towards initiating the cycle of interest rate cuts.",
        "In this respect, they argue that the monetary policy adjustment introduced and continued since September 2021 has achieved its purpose of reducing excess demand in the economy and will continue to work throughout the remainder of the year.",
        "This is revealed by the significant weakening of domestic demand, especially investment, reflected in the significant current account deficit correction, which would decrease to 3.4% of GDP by the end of 2023, as forecast by the technical staff, after an imbalance of 6.2% of GDP in the previous year.",
        "They add that there was also a significant correction in the fiscal imbalance, which stands out as one of the largest adjustments made by the countries in the region in the last year, given the projected decrease in the general government deficit from -6.5% to -3.3% of GDP between 2022 and 2023, according to the medium-term fiscal framework published in June.",
        "They note that these adjustments bring the economy closer to a more sustainable future growth path and thus improve Colombia's international financial conditions.",
        "However, they expressed concern that an amplification of the economic slowdown could threaten household income and undermine the progress in reducing poverty achieved in 2022.",
        "On this matter, they noted that financial closings of road and housing construction projects currently headed by the private sector have been hampered by the high interest rates in force, which in turn weakens the pace of economic activity.The Directors agreed that the Board's decision was in line with the objective of bringing inflation down toward its 3% target, and reiterated that future decisions by the Board will be determined according to new information available.",
        "The Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicaunanimously decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate 25 basis points (bp) to 13%.In their policy discussion, the Board of Directors took the following factors into account:In February, the 13.3% annual inflation rose only 3 bps compared to what it was in January.",
        "This slowdown in price changes is partly due to the moderation of annual food price inflation, which was 24.1% in February and significantly lower than December's figure (27.8%).",
        "At the same time, pressures on costs are easing: international prices of food and other imported goods have been falling, and this has been reflected in progressive declines in producer price inflation (PPI).",
        "The annual increase of PPI went from 19.2% in December to 15.1% in February.",
        "These favorable signs suggest that the inflation rate is approaching its ceiling and, from this point, it will probably begin the expected decline for 2023.Inflation expectations are beginning to incorporate this positive news.",
        "This was shown by the results of the monthly survey of economic analysts done byBanco de la Repúblicain which the 12-month inflation expectation went from 7.7% in the January survey to 7.2% in March in the sample median.",
        "Something similar occurred with the corresponding 24-month expectation that went from 4.5% to 4.0%.",
        "To the extent that this reduction in inflation expectations consolidates and becomes widespread among the economy's price-setting agents, the price indexation phenomenon will begin to subside, thus facilitating the return of inflation to its target.The Economic Monitoring Indicator (EMI), which had been showing a slowdown since October, rose 5.8% in January, with improvements in secondary and tertiary activities.",
        "Due to the improvement in the economy in January compared to what had been forecast as well as the effect of a lower statistical base due to DANE's revision of the 2022 figures, the technical staff raised its GDP growth forecast for 2023 from 0.2% to 0.8%.",
        "In spite of this improvement in the forecast, economic activity continues to show a significant slowdown compared to its strength in 2022 as can be deduced from the fall in imports, lower housing starts, lower vehicle sales, weaker real manufacturing production, and reduced growth in the loan portfolio, among other things.Although recent financial stability problems in the United States and some European countries have generated nervousness and volatility in international markets, which has increased uncertainty about the trend of the world economy, their effects on the Colombian economy have been limited due to a well-regulated and supervised banking system that comfortably complies with Basel Committee standards.In the context described above, the members of the Board of Directors unanimously agreed to increase the policy rate by 25 bp.",
        "They emphasized that inflation and the behavior of inflation expectations have moved in the desired direction.",
        "They agreed on the need to continue the upward cycle of the interest rate, although this time with a smaller increase, to ensure the return of inflation to the 3.0% target that the Board has proposed to achieve by the end of 2024.",
        "In their discussion, different opinions were expressed that gradually became closer until an agreement was reached that allowed for a unanimous decision.Some Board Members reiterated that increases in monetary policy interest rates from 1.75% in September 2021 to 12.75% in January 2023 have moderated demand as illustrated by declines in the dollar value of imports since November as well as other demand indicators.",
        "In this regard, they noted that, although the EMI results for January were above expectations, the information obtained from meetings with businessmen and business opinion surveys suggested that it was unlikely that such a positive trend will continue in the coming months.",
        "They underscored the encouraging signs in terms of inflation despite the seasonal increase in education in February that was offset by the moderation of food price inflation and electricity tariffs.",
        "They added that consumer credit growth has been declining from rates near 23% per annum in the third quarter of 2022 to rates below 13% in -March.",
        "They stressed that, despite its volatility, the exchange rate has changed positively since the high levels in October 2022.",
        "With regard to risks, they underscored the 3-percentage point decrease in the TES interest rate since October, which reflects an improvement in the sense of confidence.",
        "This will probably be supported by the technical staff's perspective of a reduction of the external deficit in the current account of the balance of payments from 6.2% of GDP in 2022 to 4.0% of GDP in 2023 despite a significant drop in the prices of export commodities, particularly oil.Other members of the Board noted that while there were encouraging signs of a slowdown in overall inflation, core inflation continued to persist under the pressure from price indexation effects.",
        "In addition, they stressed the fact that, although inflation expectations for one and two years in the future had declined between January and March, economic analysts' expectations for the end of 2023, as measured by the March survey of Banco de la República, had risen again.",
        "Should these expectations remain high, they could hinder the process of converging to the target within the established timeframe due to the specific importance that the year-end inflation figures have for adjustments to various prices and tariffs for the upcoming year.",
        "They added that signs of a smaller slowdown in economic activity could prolong the momentum of private consumption and delay the correction of excess demand.",
        "They noted that the economy has become more sensitive to external shocks and there is still a risk of high exchange rate volatility.",
        "This is even more likely given the prospect of lower oil prices.",
        "They emphasized the fact that, despite the expected progress in the adjustment of public finances, the pressure of the fiscal deficit on aggregate demand and the external imbalance persists.",
        "They reminded everyone that interest rate increases in developed economies reduce Colombia's competitiveness in the international capital market and, under such conditions, the need to consolidate the contractionary monetary policy stance must be stressed to ensure the desired disinflationary trajectory and reestablish macroeconomic equilibrium.",
        "They noted that credit continues to grow at faster rates than the broad monetary aggregates (M2 and M3).",
        "In this regard, they warned of the risk of slowing down policy rate adjustments should it be necessary to increase the policy rate at a later date.The Board agreed that, although there were differing opinions, a 25-bp increase in the policy interest rate would address their main concerns, and therefore concluded that with this decision, monetary policy would continue to make progress towards its objective of bringing inflation to the 3.0% target.",
        "Subsequent decisions by the Board will depend on the new information available.",
        "Annual consumer price inflation decreased in May for the second consecutive month to 12.4%, fronted by a reduction in the annual food price inflation rate from 27.8% in December 2022 to 15.7% in May 2023.",
        "In contrast, increases were observed in the inflation of regulated items resulting from heightened gasoline prices, as well as the inflation rate of services.",
        "The core inflation rate excluding food and regulated items remained stable at around 10.5% and, like headline inflation, is still significantly distant from the established target of 3.0%.",
        "The survey of economic analysts results for May showed that, according to the sample median, their inflation expectations for the 12- and 24-month forward horizon continue to decline and currently stand at 6.4% and 4.0%, respectively; for yearend 2024 median expectations of the sample remained at 5.0%.",
        "Furthermore, inflation expectations derived from the government debt securities (TES) market for the one- and five-year-ahead horizons, controlling for liquidity risks and inflation premium, stand at between 4.8% and 6.4% respectively.",
        "During the first quarter of 2023, GDP registered an annual growth of 3.0%, a year-on-year decrease versus the same quarter of the previous year (8.1%), as a result of a slowdown in consumption and contraction of gross capital formation.",
        "Economic activity continued to decelerate in April, as observed in the Economic Monitor Indicator (ISE), which exhibited a -0.8% drop during this period.",
        "Despite the observed deceleration, according to the National Administrative Department of Statistics’ (DANE) May report, there was no impairment in the labor market indicators, and rather the upward trend in the employed population and decline in the national aggregate unemployment rate continued.",
        "A slowdown in domestic demand has led to a significant correction of the country's external imbalance, with the current account deficit narrowing to 4.2% of GDP in the first quarter of 2023, versus a deficit of 6.2% in 2022.",
        "To date this year, the Colombian peso has presented a considerable appreciation against the US dollar of 13%, while risk premiums for Colombia have decreased substantially, partially reversing the relative deterioration observed in the previous two years in comparison to other emerging economies.",
        "This has occurred against a backdrop of high global economic uncertainty and lower international oil prices, from an average benchmark price of close to USD 100 per barrel in 2022 to prices currently fluctuating below USD 80 per barrel.",
        "The Directors noted that annual headline inflation, after stabilizing at a figure slightly above 13% during the first quarter, registered successive decreases in April and May due to the decrease in food inflation; downward adjustments in the international price of some food and transportation costs; the revaluation of the country’s exchange rate; and the decline in producer price inflation, among other factors.",
        "The above within an environment of moderated growth of domestic demand and a contractionary monetary policy interest rate.",
        "At the same time, they stressed that there are risks ahead underlying the behavior of inflation that cannot be overlooked, such as the El Niño weather phenomenon, the anticipated increases in domestic fuel prices, and the uncertainty surrounding the international economic state of affairs.",
        "Under these circumstances, they unanimously supported the decision to leave the intervention interest rate unchanged and warned that conditions were not yet suitable to relax its contractionary monetary policy stance.",
        "In their interventions, the Directors expounded on the grounds for their decision and the need to maintain a cautious approach to monetary policy management.",
        "The Board of Directors of Banco de la República highlighted the decrease of headline inflation by close to one percentage point between March and May.",
        "They noted the slowdown in the rise of core inflation and the reduction seen in inflation expectations as the peso appreciated, despite increases in gasoline prices that exert upward pressure on the regulated items component of the consumer basket.",
        "They added that the cumulative 11.5 percentage points increase in the policy interest rate is already evident in a cooling growth rate of aggregate demand, as seen in the first quarter GDP results and the ISE for April.",
        "They remarked that the downward adjustment in domestic demand, surpassing that seen for GDP, has admitted a reduction of the current account deficit.",
        "They also noted a less dynamic consumer credit, from increasing at annual rates reaching 23% in the third quarter of 2022 to more moderate annual growth of less than 7% by -June, and 0% if the variation is measured for the last thirteen weeks.",
        "The lower consumer credit activity lessens the probability of household over-indebtedness.",
        "Finally, the Directors acknowledged the government's advances in reducing the fiscal imbalance through the last two tax reforms, and their determination to undertake the necessary fuel price adjustments.",
        "While acknowledging progress, the Directors underscored several risks that could affect the future behavior of inflation that require special caution in the formulation of forthcoming monetary policy decisions to avoid delaying its convergence to the 3.0 target.",
        "Consequently, they pointed out that, despite the recent reduction in inflation, the latter continues to register a significantly high level, in contrast with the substantial inflation reductions recently experienced in advanced countries and comparable Latin American economies.",
        "They added that core inflation without food or regulated items, particularly the services component, has shown a marked rigidity, demonstrating that, except for food, significant inflationary pressures persist.",
        "In this regard, they warned that expectations for both headline inflation and inflation excluding food continue high and above the target at several terms, despite their recent decreases.",
        "In addition, the Directors pointed to specific risks that introduce significant uncertainty regarding future inflation behavior.",
        "These include potential effects of the El Niño weather phenomenon on food and energy prices, and high global uncertainty.",
        "They stressed that risk scenarios subsist that require leaving room for a possible monetary policy response in the direction which the Board of Directors of Banco de la República considers necessary.",
        "Finally, the Directors emphasize that the decision adopted in today’s meeting is compatible with its objective of bringing inflation to its 3% target.",
        "Future decisions by the Board will be determined according to new information available."

    "2015": [
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá, , on January 30, 2015.",
        "In attendance were Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor of the Central Bank, and Board Members Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, César Vallejo Mejía, and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of the outlook of Banco de la República's technical staff on the macroeconomic situation (section 1), followed by a review of the main discussion regarding policy alternatives considered by the Board of Directors (section 2).A moredetailed description of the macroeconomic situationprepared by the technical staff from the Central Bank is provided in the data section of the December 2014 edition of the Inflation Report, as well as in the statistical appendix CONTEXTIn the present report, oil prices continued to decrease and registered levels unobserved since 2009.",
        "The probability that a major portion of this descent be structural is high; therefore the forecasts on the price of oil lowered significantly versus the estimations produced a quarter before.",
        "Other products exported by Colombia such as coal and nickel also posted falls in their international prices.The risk premia of several emerging countries have increased, their currencies have depreciated, and the price of some financial assets has deteriorated.",
        "This behavior has been much more accentuated in oil-producing countries such as Colombia.This has taken place within a context of weak global economic activity, driven mainly by the economy of the USA.",
        "The euro zone continues with low growth of its GDP, while that of the main emerging countries continues to slow down or registers historically low increases.",
        "With this outlook, the technical staff reduced the average growth of our trade partners for 2015, a fact that reflects a weaker recovery than had been estimated in the previous quarterly report.In the USA, the long-term interest rates fell again, and it is likely that the first increase in the FED's benchmark rate takes place at the start of the second semester and that it continues gradually.",
        "Regarding the euro zone, the European Central Bank began its purchasing program of financial bonds, which will extend at least until September 2016.The fall in the prices of oil, which surpasses the reductions in the international prices of some food items imported by Colombia, will be reflected on a greater-than-expected descent in the country's terms of trade.",
        "Should these levels continue, the national income in 2015 would fall.The fall in the price of oil continues to affect the value of the country's exports.",
        "In November 2014, external sales fell, which is explained mainly by the lower prices of oil exported.",
        "Sales of the main agricultural products continued showing high increases, while exports of other sectors fell, although not as much as those of the mining sector.Given the aforesaid, for all of 2014 the most probable forecast of the current account deficit as a proportion to the GDP increased, reaching the higher limit of the range estimated a quarter before (5.0%).",
        "It is estimated that in 2015 the deficit and its financing be lower, partly as a result of an expected reduction in direct foreign investment (especially in oil), and by a less dynamic portfolio investment.As for the domestic context, the new data for the fourth quarter of 2014 suggest that domestic demand continued to be dynamic, and that the net exports would have subtracted more than was expected to the output.",
        "Considering this, the technical staff expects that economic growth for 2014 may be posting between 4.5% and 5.0%, with 4.8% as the most probable outcome.As for the labor market, with seasonally adjusted data, the unemployment rate to December continues to be low, with the highest occupation rate of the last 14 years, driven mainly by salaried employment.In December, annual growth of corporate credit has slowed down, a fact that is explained mainly by the lower pace in the increase of direct foreign credit.",
        "On the contrary, consumer credit showed a greater dynamism, and more than compensated the slow-down registered in mortgage loans.",
        "This has taken place together with relatively stable credit rates, which during the second semester of 2014 have only partially reflected the increase registered in the benchmark interest rate.For 2015, the technical staff reduced the range for the economic growth forecast to an interval between 2.0% and 4.0%, with 3.6% as the most probable figure.",
        "This more likely estimate considers a fall in the national income and lower foreign financing, which could generate a moderation in expenditure, especially due to a lower level of private investment.Nevertheless, it is important to mention that uncertainty regarding the aforementioned range is high and will depend on the size of the fall expected in the terms of trade, the cost and level of foreign financing, and the effect that the fall in the national income would have over the decisions of private and public expenditure.",
        "If the most likely growth forecasts take place, the output gap could be positive in 2014 and may become slightly negative in the present year (which had previously been estimated as positive).Regarding prices, inflation posted at 3.66% in December 2014, a number similar to the forecast by Banco de la República's technical staff, and which is 80 basic points (bp) above that of September.",
        "In the last quarter, the greater pace of increase in the prices of foods and regulated goods explained a great percentage of the acceleration of inflation.",
        "In the same period, the average of the four core inflation indicators increased 43 bp and posted at 3.06% in December.Inflation expectations of market analysts on a one year horizon as well as those derived from public debt bonds for longer terms increased and are above 3.0%.It is expected that the greater level of the exchange rate be passed-through to domestic prices, although the magnitude of said transmission depends on many factors, which makes it uncertain.",
        "In this context, given the accumulated depreciation until January of 2015, there is a risk that consumer inflation continues to increase this year.",
        "A high pass-through could affect expectations and have more persistent effects on inflation.In all, domestic demand continues to be dynamic in a context close to the full use of the productive capacity.",
        "At the same time, inflation and its expectations are above 3.0%.",
        "This takes place in an environment of strong deterioration of the terms of trade, with high uncertainty regarding its future behavior.",
        "Global economic activity is recovering more slowly than was expected, and the evolution of the cost of financing is also uncertain.",
        "All these factors can impact the future behavior of aggregate demand AND OPTIONSThe Board Members agree that Colombian economy will adjust to the fall in the terms of trade, growing less in 2015 and 2016 than in 2013 and 2014.The dynamics of inflation in 2015 will mainly be affected by a lower economic growth and by the possible short-term effects of the depreciation of the peso on consumer inflation.",
        "Some Board Members consider that the effect of depreciation can initially take precedence over the low growth and transitorily deviate inflation from the target.",
        "As long as the expectations continue to be anchored to the -term target (3.0%), this effect on inflation would fade within the monetary policy horizon.In turn, one of the members of the Board expects GDP to grow between 3.0% and 3.5%, with which the negative output gap would be greater than is expected by the technical staff and would have an even stronger mitigating effect over prices.",
        "In this context, it is appropriate for the monetary authority to continue keeping the benchmark interest rate unaltered.With a countercyclical criterion, another Board Member considered necessary to contemplate scenarios with lower benchmark interest rates DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Bogotá,",

        "In its statement, the FOMC highlighted the improvements exhibited by the labor market, and suggested gradual increases in the reference rate during 2016.",
        "The information available for the fourth quarter indicates that the U economy could maintain its dynamism, driven by the strength of domestic demand, particularly by consumptionDespite the good performance of the U economy, global demand remains weak.",
        "In the euro zone, economic activity continues with a very slow recovery.",
        "In China, the information available suggests that its economy may have ceased to slow down, but might have low dynamism.",
        "As for Latin America, GDP in the third quarter showed a deepening of the recession in Brazil and mediocre performance in Chile and PeruIn recent weeks, the price of oil dropped significantly again, and to December 15 posted 9.9% below the observations from November.",
        "It is not unlikely that there may be additional reductions in the international price of oil in the future.",
        "The risk premia of Latin American countries also increased, and for Brazil and Colombia reached their highest levels since 2009In addition to oil, international prices of other commodities exported by the region, particularly by Colombia, continue being low.",
        "With this, the country’s terms of trade could register further deteriorationThe drop in the price of oil, the increase in the risk premia, and the expectations of increases in the Federal Reserve's reference rate, explain much of the strong depreciation of the Colombian peso, which has led the exchange rate to historically high records.",
        "The currencies of the region also depreciated, but to a lesser extentFor Colombia, foreign trade figures to October show that exports in US dollars are still falling, mainly due to the impact of lower pricesGDP in the third quarter grew 3.2% on a yearly basis, more than expected by the technical staff.",
        "Domestic demand grew by 2.8%, similar to the records for the second quarter.",
        "Total consumption accelerated vis-à-vis the previous quarter, while the growth of gross capital formation was the same.",
        "Net exports contributed negatively to growth.",
        "On the supply side, all sectors exhibited growth, except for mining and construction of buildings.",
        "The figures available for the fourth quarter are still scarce, but indicate that the dynamism observed between July and September will continueTotal credit has slowed down, but it continues to expand at rates higher than the nominal GDP.",
        "The commercial portfolio continued with its growth rates, while the pace of increase of the household portfolio has decreased.",
        "Real credit interest rates have slowed their decline and register below the average calculated since 2000As for the labor market with data to October, the seasonally adjusted series show an increase in the unemployment rate in recent months due to a slowdown in employmentConsidering all this, the technical staff reduced the width of the growth forecast range for the whole year.",
        "Expansion of the economy would lie somewhere between 2.8% and 3.2%, with 3.0% as the most likely figureRegarding the annual consumer inflation, in November it stood at 6.39%, above the projections by analysts and the technical staff atBanco de la República.",
        "So far this year, it has accumulated 6.11%, as against 3.38% in the same period in 2014.",
        "All core inflation indicators are above 5.0%Including this month and in the year to date, acceleration of inflation is explained by the behavior of the prices of food (9.81%) and of tradable goods excluding food and regulated items (6.92%)The measures of inflation expectations obtained from the survey applied to financial analysts increased in the last month and were located at 6.67%, 4.63% and 3.83%, for the end of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.",
        "To December 15, inflation expectations embedded in 2-year term TES remained stable, and declined slightly in those with terms to 3 and 5 years.",
        "The latter posted at levels similar to or higher than 4.5%Looking ahead, the adverse effects ofEl Niño, the pass-through of the depreciation of the peso towards domestic prices, and the activation of some indexation mechanisms, could maintain inflation at high levels during the first semester of 2016.",
        "It is expected that in the second semester next year these transitory shocks will diminish.",
        "This, together with monetary policy actions, should lead inflation to the target in a two-year horizon.In synthesis, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate related largely to the fall in the price of oil have generated new inflationary pressures.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations remain high and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, beyond that which is consistent with the decline exhibited in national income, has moderated AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlighted the rise in all of the inflation indicators (total and core), the strength of domestic demand in spite of the negative effect of the drop in oil prices on national revenue, and the recent upward revision of the growth projection for 2015 done by the technical team at the Bank.",
        "Likewise, both the surveys and the Bank models suggest that medium term inflation expectations have deviated from the target fixed by the Board.",
        "With respect to the current account deficit in the balance of payments, the available data does not show any signs of correction thus raising the perception of macroeconomic risk for the Colombian economy.Considering the strength of domestic demand, inflation factors, and the deficit level in the current account, the majority of the members of the Board consider a 25 bp increase in the interest rate to be necessary and reiterate the message that we are on course for a hardening of monetary policy.",
        "A course of incremental rises similar to the one announced is advisable since it reinforces the message of the Board’s commitment to the inflation targets, makes it possible to better calibrate the optimal response to new external shocks, and makes the Board’s decisions more predictable for the market thus improving the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "The length of this path will be whatever is necessary for inflation to converge to its target in 2017.The rest of the members of the Board believe that strong indexing mechanisms would be enabled in the Colombian economy and that the probability of additional effects of supply shocks on inflation have risen.",
        "Specifically, the effect of the pass through of devaluation to consumer prices and the impact of theEl Niñophenomenon on food and energy prices.",
        "These shocks will probably bring additional upswings in inflation during the first half of 2016 which will affect expectations and reduce the real interest rate.",
        "In a context where there is a high current account deficit in the balance of payments which reflects an excess of expenditure over revenue, the additional effects of the supply shocks reinforce the need to act now with a 50 bp increase in the interest rate.",
        "Lower increases could be insufficient to anchor inflation expectations to the target and strengthen the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "This would make the convergence of inflation to the target slower and more difficult and require increases in the interest rate in the future that could coincide with a pronounced slowdown in expenditure and output DECISIONThe Board of Directors ofBanco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.75%.",

        "Additional falls are expected in this indicator at the beginning of 2015, in spite of the recovery observed in the last few days in the prices of oilIn the last few weeks, the risk premia of Colombia and several other countries in the region reduced, but remain at levels higher than the average registered in 2014.",
        "So far this year to February, the value of the peso versus the US dollar has been volatile, although without a definite trendRecovery of the world economy continues to be weak, although it has been somewhat better in some developed countries than had been forecast.",
        "In the United States, the indicators of real activity aim at a good result in the present quarter.",
        "The growth of Germany to the end of 2014 turned out better than had been forecast, and in January the confidence and industry indicators of the euro zone showed positive trends.",
        "The main emerging economies continue slowing down or presenting historically low increases.",
        "Facing this context, the technical staff maintained the average growth forecast for our trade partners for 2015 presented in the previous reportIn the United States, the long-term interest rates of public debt bonds stopped falling and registered below the average for 2014.",
        "It is likely that the first increase in the benchmark rate of the Federal Reserve takes place at the beginning of the second semester and that it continues gradually.",
        "Greece's financing problems and uncertainty about its permanence in the euro zone increased the volatility of the stock markets in that regionIn Colombia, the increase of imports and the fall of exports in December resulted somewhat greater than the forecast.",
        "These data suggest that deficit in the trade balance could be greater in the fourth quarter of 2014 than had been estimated.",
        "On the side of financing, capital inflows directed to portfolio investment continued in January; however, new announcements about plans for foreign direct investment in the oil sector continue reflecting an important fall in this type of external financingRegarding the labor market, the figures to December show a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate that continues at low levels thanks to the dynamism of the occupation rate, explained mainly by salaried employmentNew data for the fourth quarter of 2014 suggest that domestic demand continued to be dynamic, and that net exports would have subtracted more than expected to the output.",
        "With this information, the forecast of economic growth for 2014 was kept between 4.5% and 5.0%, with 4.8% as the most probable figureThe few data of real activity for the first quarter of 2015 show mixed signals.",
        "On the supply side, oil and coffee production in January grew more than had been estimated.",
        "On the demand side, the fall in car sales suggests a slowdown in the consumption of durables for that monthIn January, annual growth of corporate credit slowed down again, due to the slower pace of increase of direct external credit.",
        "Household credit maintained relatively stable growth rates.",
        "Increases in both types of debt portfolio surpass the increase of nominal GDP estimated for the present year.",
        "This took place together with increasing credit interest rates, although in real terms they continue at levels below their historic averages (excepting credit cards).10.With all this, for 2015 the technical staff maintained the most probable growth rate at 3.6%, within a range between 2.0% and 4.0%.",
        "The amplitude of the interval reflects the uncertainty over assumptions in possible extreme scenarios.",
        "In turn, the most probable value considers a lower dynamics in national income and a reduction of external financing, which could moderate expenditure, especially through a lower level of private investment.11.Regarding prices, inflation in January increased and registered 3.82%, a number higher than had been forecast by the technical staff of the Bank and by the market average.",
        "The acceleration of inflation is explained mainly by the greater pace of increase in the prices of food.",
        "The average of core inflation completed four months increasing, registering 3.22%.12.Inflation expectations by market analysts and those derived from public debt bonds are in the upper half of the target range on the average.13.Although the greater level of the exchange rate has been partially passed through to internal prices, this transmission has probably not finished.",
        "On the other hand, the magnitude of the pass through depends on many factors, which makes it uncertain.",
        "In this context, given the depreciation accumulated to February 2015, there is a risk that the annual variance of the group of tradables without food and regulated goods increases more than was forecast.",
        "A high pass through to the group of tradables could affect expectations and have more persistent effects upon inflation.In all, by the end of 2014, domestic demand showed dynamism in a context close to the full use of the productive capacity.",

        "Inflation expectations are anchored to the target, in spite of the increase in inflation observed in recent months.For some Board Members, as long as the effect of the diminution of the terms of trade has a permanent component, the national income fall is partly structural and, therefore, it is not adequate to try to substitute this loss of income through a more expansive monetary policy.One of the members expressed that in spite of the apparent slowdown of the economy that has been forecast, which would cause the return of the output gap to a negative region during the present year, the benchmark interest rate should be kept unaltered, at least for what is left of the year, except in the case that extraordinary or unforeseen events alter significantly the fundamentals of the economy.Finally, the members of the Board mentioned that if there is an over-adjustment in expenditure by the private sector in relation to the new potential GDP, the monetary authority should be open to a counter-cyclical policy DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Bogotá,",

        "The euro zone maintains a slow recovery while the likelihood that China’s economic slowdown may be stronger than expected increased.",
        "The main trading partners of Colombia in Latin America continue to register low growths and some falls in their economic activity.As for international financial markets, the agreement between Greece and its creditors substantially reduced global risk aversion.",
        "In China, the poor performance of companies generated substantial drops in the stock market from historically high levels.",
        "In the United States, the probability of an increase in the interest rate of reference by the Federal Reserve augmented, and with this market interest rates have risen and the US dollar continues strengthening.The prospects of lower global growth, high levels of oil production, and the growing prospects for supply of this commodity, generated a fall in international oil prices in the last few weeks.",
        "These new levels fell below the estimate by the technical staff for the average of 2015.",
        "Something similar happened with the prices of other mining commodities exported by Colombia.",
        "Thus, this year the fall in the terms of trade will continue to have a significant negative effect on national income.The lower prices of basic goods and the weakness in external demand have affected the behavior of Colombia’s external sales in US dollars.",
        "In the two-month period of April-May, exports continued to record important annual falls.",
        "The largest decreases were those of external mining sales, followed by the fall in exports of agricultural goods and other sectors.In April-May the yearly decline in the value of imports in US dollars was also important, although less than the one registered for exports.",
        "The greatest falls were those of foreign purchases of capital goods, followed by the decline in imports of raw materials and consumption.With the new data, the technical staff has revised the projection for 2015 of the current account deficit relative to GDP upwards.",
        "The new range is between 4.8% and 6.4%, with 5.6% as the most likely figure.",
        "This revision considers a more negative balance in the trade of non-factor services, partially offset by a lower deficit in net exports and smaller net outflows of capital revenue.As for the domestic context, the indicators of retail trade, consumer and commerce confidence, economic expectations of the monthly survey by Banco de la República, and of imports and consumption of capital goods, suggest that in the second quarter of 2015 the absorption would have slowed down again.",
        "The trade deficit measured in constant pesos would have reduced.Regarding the labor market, the downward trend in unemployment rates (seasonally adjusted) shows signs of interruption.",
        "In recent months, the global participation rate has remained relatively stable, while the occupation rate has decreased.Real interest rates have lowered, and are below their historical averages calculated since 2000 (except for credit cards).",
        "Total credit has slowed down, but is growing at rates higher than the one for nominal GDP.Considering this, the technical staff believes that the growth of the economy for the second quarter of 2015 would have been similar to that recorded in the first quarter.",
        "For all of 2015, the most likely figure was revised from 3.2% to 2.8%, within a range of 1.8% and 3.4%.Annual inflation in June remained relatively stable, standing at 4.42%, somewhat lower than the estimated by the technical staff and by the market average.",
        "On this occasion, the slower pace of increase of the CPI for regulated goods offset the increases registered in other groups.",
        "The average of the four measures of core inflation rose again, reaching 4.14%.Inflation expectations to one and two years by financial analysts remained relatively stable.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds to more than two years were reduced.",
        "All of them are around 3.0%.In all, inflation remains above the upper limit of the target range, inflation expectations are around 3.0%, and domestic expenditure of the economy continues adjusting to the lower dynamics of national income.",
        "In the monetary policy horizon, it is expected that the temporary price shocks be reversed in an environment of inflation expectations anchored to the target AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlighted the gradual adjustment of domestic expenditure of the economy to the lower dynamics of the national income and a level of inflation above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "In the monetary policy horizon, it is expected that the temporary price shocks be reversed in an environment of inflation expectations anchored to the target.Some Board Members consider there are factors that increase the risk that inflation expectations diverge from the target in the future, which could be an argument for a preventive increase of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "However, considering the magnitude of the shock in the terms of trade, there are also high risks that economy grows below the forecasts by the technical staff.",
        "Therefore, they deem appropriate not to increase the benchmark interest rate pro-cyclically, unless the probability of compromising the credibility of the monetary policy increases, or that the adjustment in expenditure is still insufficient to guide the inflation to its long-term target.Other Board-members felt that, given that inflation has remained relatively stable at 4.42% and its expectations continue within the target range, and that domestic demand is expected to suffer a significant shock, it is prudent to wait and gather more information related to the behavior of prices, particularly the impact of pass through.",
        "An increase in the benchmark interest rate at this moment would be inappropriate because inflation is still caused by temporary phenomena, and a change in the policy signals could affect expectations within a context in which these are anchored.A third group expressed their concern about the persistent rise in the average of the core inflation indicators over nine consecutive months (which also already exceeded the upper limit of the target range, 4.0%), and the ensuing likelihood that expectations become unanchored from the target.",
        "Additionally, they opined that, at the present juncture, the risk of higher inflation seems more likely than that of an excessive slowdown, and stressed that the key to a good monetary policy lies in the authorities’ ability to anticipate.",
        "A lower monetary stimulus of 25 bp should not have an excessive additional impact on the slowdown of the economy and employment.",
        "Rather, it would have the advantage of strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations to the target, reducing the devaluation pressure, and helping to correct the current account deficit.",
        "Additionally, it would be a signal of the commitment of the Central Bank to controlling inflation, and it would increase the credibility of the monetary authority DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by majority, considered maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.",

        "China's GDP slowed down again, while the figures for economic activity of the major countries in the region suggest that their product will expand at low or negative rates.",
        "With this, it is likely that in 2015 the average economic growth of our trade partners be less than the one observed a year ago.The increase in the benchmark interest rate of the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin towards the end of this year.",
        "In turn, the central banks in the euro zone and Japan continued their policy of strong monetary stimulus.In the euro zone and to a lesser extent in the United States, the long-term interest rates on public debt bonds increased, but remain at levels lower than the average recorded in 2014.",
        "The US dollar, which had depreciated vis-à-vis most currencies in April and early May, changed this trend  in the past week.",
        "Among the main countries of the region, the depreciation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar has been one of the most pronounced in the last week.Oil prices have partially recovered, but still exhibit levels well below the average observed for the last five years.",
        "This behavior and that of other commodity prices exported and imported by Colombia indicate that in 2015 the terms of trade would register low levels, similar to those observed at the beginning of 2009.",
        "This fall in the terms of trade entails a significant loss in the dynamics of national income.The behavior of external demand and of the prices of commodities has been reflected on the results of foreign trade in US dollars.",

        "In the same period, total CIF imports accumulated a 4.4% fall.As for the domestic context, the new information for the first quarter of 2015 and April indicates that economic activity in this period would have been less dynamic than the one registered in the last quarter of 2014.",
        "The information on retail trade, consumer confidence, and the survey of economic expectations by Banco de la República suggest a slowdown of consumption and private investment.",
        "On the supply side, the fall of industrial production, the lower growth of non-regulated energy demand, and the downturn in the present and future perception of trade indicate that economic growth will continue slowing down.",
        "Information on other activities such as oil, coffee and cement production suggests good behaviors.As for the labor market, the figures to March 2015 show that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate continues at historically low levels, with a dynamic occupation rate which is explained mainly by salaried employment.In April, total corporate and household debt grew at a lower pace than the one registered in the first quarter, but greater than the nominal GDP increase estimated for the present year.",
        "This took place together with decreasing interest rates (for trade and consumption), which in real terms continue at levels below their historic averages (excepting credit cards).With all this, the technical staff considers that growth during the first quarter would register between 2.0% and 3.5%, with 2.7% as the most probable outcome.",
        "For all of 2015, the most probable growth figure would be 3.2%, within a range of 2.0% to 4.0%.",
        "The amplitude of the interval reflects uncertainty over assumptions in possible extreme scenarios.Regarding prices, inflation increased in April reaching 4.64%, a number higher than had been forecast by the market average and the technical staff at the Central Bank.",
        "Acceleration of inflation is explained mainly by the higher pace of increase in the prices of food, and secondly, by the increase in the prices of tradable and non-tradable goods excepting food and regulated goods.",
        "The average of core inflation completed seven months increasing, registering 3.84%.Inflation expectations by market analysts and those derived from public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5-year horizons are within a range of 3.1% and 3.5%.In summary, the increase observed in inflation so far is due to transitory factors, and its medium-term expectations are close to 3.0%, within a context of slow-down in aggregate demand AND OPTIONSThe Board Members agreed that the reduction in the terms of trade has a permanent component that affects national income negatively; therefore, the domestic demand should be adjusted.",
        "This adjustment process to the new external conditions is taking place in an orderly way.Likewise, they agreed that product growth will slow down as part of this process.",
        "However, they differ in the magnitude of the slowdown and of the product gap resulting from this behavior.",
        "Yet, all output forecasts of the Board Members are within the forecast range of the technical staff of the Central Bank (between 2.0% and 4.0%).The members of the Board coincide in that the slowdown of the aggregate expenditure will prevent inflationary pressures from taking place due to excess of demand, and that medium-term inflation expectations are anchored to levels consistent with the target.",
        "The anchoring of expectations and the absence of demand excesses are fundamental elements for inflation to converge to the target in the policy horizon.",
        "They also agree that if there were to be any phenomena that endangered achieving the inflation target in the policy horizon, the monetary authority will have to react in order to conjure said risk.As for the level reached by the current account deficit of the balance of payments, the Board stated that this is one of the sources of greater vulnerability for the Colombian economy, and that, in that regard, the lower growth of internal demand and the real devaluation of the peso are necessary elements to reduce it gradually DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.",

        "In the United States, the economy would have continued to grow at favorable rates, while the euro zone is recovering slowly.",
        "In China, the slowdown continues and its central bank implemented new measures to stimulate the economy.",
        "The major economies of Latin America recorded low increases and, in some cases, setbacks.In its meeting of September, the Federal Reserve of the United States decided not to increase its benchmark interest rate.",
        "According to its statement, this decision was reached due to the increased uncertainty in the international outlook and lower-than-expected inflationary pressures.",
        "In spite of this, projections from the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggest that the Fed would increase its policy rate in the last part of the year, and that it would continue increasing gradually in the future.So far this month, volatility indicators of financial markets fell from the high levels reached at the end of August.",
        "Risk premia in the largest economies in the region have remained at levels higher than those in 2014, and the prices of the currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar remain highly volatile.In the last few weeks, the international price of oil recovered slightly, but is still low (less than USD 50 for the Brent reference) and highly volatile.",
        "The international prices of other commodities remain much lower than the levels recorded in recent years.",
        "This has caused a drop in the terms of trade of exporting countries and has deteriorated their national income.",
        "In the present year, this trend has been particularly marked in Colombia.The figures for the second quarter of 2015 show that the adjustment of the external deficit of the country would be taking place more slowly than expected, a fact explained mainly by the behavior of the trade balance.",
        "Low prices of commodities and the weakness of external demand for the country have been reflected in a deterioration of external sales (-32.6% accumulated to July) a figure higher than had been forecast.",
        "Imports have fallen at a slower pace than had been foreseen (-12.1% accumulated to July).As for the domestic context, GDP results for the second quarter revealed by DANE exhibited growth of the economy (3.0% on a yearly basis), somewhat better than had been projected.",
        "Domestic demand has slowed down significantly, as expected.",
        "The adjustment took place mainly by investment in machinery and transportation equipment, while private consumption decelerated at a slower pace.",
        "Both exports and imports fell in real terms, but their net contribution to GDP growth was positive.On the supply side, the sectors that grew most were construction and mining (8.7% and 4.2%, respectively), and the only branch that reported a reduction in its production was industry (-1.3%).",
        "The information available for the third quarter exhibits no changes in these trends.",
        "For all of 2015, the technical staff maintained its estimation for economic growth at 2.8% as the most likely figure, within a range between 1.8% and 3.4%.As for the labor market, the unemployment rate fell in July, which is explained by a lower level of labor force participation and not by an increase in hiring.",
        "Additionally, salaried and formal employment have slowed down in recent months.Real interest rates continue at a level below their historical averages calculated since 2000 (except for credit cards).",
        "Credit to businesses and households continues to grow above nominal GDP.In August, annual consumer inflation increased, reaching 4.74%.",
        "So far this year, accumulated inflation registers 4.02%.",
        "Most of the increase is explained by the tradable component of the CPI excluding food and regulated goods and by food.",
        "The four core inflation indicators also exceeded the ceiling of the target range.",
        "Their average reached the highest level since June 2009.",
        "In monthly terms and with seasonally adjusted series, more than 80% of the items in the CPI basket exhibited increases in their prices.Inflation expectations of financial analysts and those embedded in public debt bonds increased significantly in September.",
        "The latter, calculated to 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, were, on average, above the ceiling of the target range to September 22.In all, the new information available exhibits a continuous and higher-than-expected increase in inflation and core inflation indicators, as well as the appearance of signals of a potential “unanchoring” of inflation expectations.",
        "The sharp increases in the prices of goods that are mostly affected by the depreciation of the peso have continued pressing inflation upwards.",
        "Prices of other goods and services also show increasing variations, which may reflect indexation, expectations of higher inflation in the future, or pressures in costs in these sectors.",
        "El Niño has intensified, increasing the risk of further increases in food and energy prices.",
        "Recent data on growth and economic activity confirm a slowdown in production and expenditure in line with the projections of the Central Bank’s technical staff, compatible with the correction of the country’s external deficit.",
        "Thus, the risk of a lasting increase in inflation and unanchoring of inflation expectations has augmented, while the risk of an excessive slowdown in economic activity has not exhibited a noticeable change AND OPTIONSIn September 2015, the Board decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, after keeping it stable for 13 months, sensing a shift in the risk balance faced by the economy.All members of the Board agree that the Colombian economy is adjusting to the strong impact on income derived from the fall in the international price of oil that has generated a substantial depreciation of the peso, which is necessary to achieve a sectoral re-orientation of spending and production, leading to the adjustment of the country’s external accounts.Due to its magnitude, this devaluation has raised inflation of consumer prices, and this increase has been reinforced by other supply pressures, especially on food.",
        "However, the Board considers that this shock is temporary, given that an additional, strong and continuous depreciation is not expected; also, they expect the phenomena affecting food prices to disappear in the policy horizon.Although there have been different perceptions concerning the risks of a fall in the rate of growth that could lead to the possibility that a larger-than-necessary adjustment may take place (particularly in a context of weak external demand), such perceptions have diminished.On the contrary, the risks of inflation expectations becoming “unanchored” in the presence of a continuous and higher-than-expected increase of inflation and core inflation indicators have augmented.",
        "Inflation expectation indicators increased, and those embedded in short and long term public debt bonds are above 4.0%.Considering this change in the risk balance faced by the economy, with greater risks of a lasting increase of inflation and unanchoring of inflation expectations, the Board decided to raise the Central Bank’s benchmark interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "With the current information, the Board believes that this increase is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the 3.0% target DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República unanimously decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 4.75%.Updated: 14/10/2015 14:28",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco of the República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, March 20, 2015.",

        "Therefore, it is probable that the terms of trade for the first quarter of 2015 be near the levels observed in the beginning of 2009.In March of 2014, the appreciation of the US dollar continued versus the majority of currencies, and the risk premia were increased.",
        "Within the countries of the region, this behavior has been more accentuated in Brazil, followed by Colombia.The recovery of the world economy is still weak and uneven.",
        "In the United States, real activity indicators show that recovery continues, and that growth in the present quarter will be similar to that registered by the end of 2014.",
        "The economic activity in the euro zone is still fragile; low growth estimations have not changed for 2015.",
        "The main emerging economies continue slowing down or presenting historically low increases.",
        "Facing this context, the technical staff maintained the average growth forecast of our trade partners for 2015 at 2.0%, a figure slightly higher than the one for 2014 (1.7%).In the United States, the long-term interest rates of public debt bonds stopped falling and registered below the average for 2014.",
        "According to the latest announcement by the Federal Reserve, it is probable that the first increment in its benchmark interest rate will take place at the beginning of the second semester, and that the increase for the year be lower that projected in prior months.In Colombia, the strong fall of exports and the high increase of imports registered in December suggest that current account deficit for all of 2014 may be higher than what was projected in the previous report.",
        "In January, total exports in dollars fell again at a rate similar to the fall in the prices of oil.",
        "Those of agricultural origin presented higher growth levels, while the remaining sectors descended significantly.The economic growth of the last quarter of 2014 (3.5%) registered at the lower part of the range estimated by the technical staff (3.3% - 4.7%).",
        "On the supply side, the mining sector and industry registered falls, while agriculture presented low dynamism.",
        "The remaining sectors grew similarly to or more than the increase in the output.",
        "During all 2014, the real GDP expanded 4.6%, a figure lower than the point of the interval projected for the year (4.8%).The figures of activity for January and February of 2015 suggest that the slowdown of the GDP observed since the second quarter of 2014 still persists.",
        "The registers for retail trade, consumer confidence, and sales expectations suggest so.",
        "On the supply side, oil production has presented growth rates higher than the forecast, but low, while industrial production fell again.Regarding the labor market, the figures to January show a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate that continues at low levels, with a dynamic occupation rate, explained mainly by salaried employment.",
        "To date, salary increases do not suggest labor costs pressures on the prices.In February, the annual growth of corporate credit slowed down again, due to the slower pace of increase of direct external credit.",
        "Household credit also reduced its dynamics.",
        "Nevertheless, increases in both types of debt portfolio surpass the increase of nominal GDP estimated for the present year.",
        "This has taken place together with credit interest rates which in real terms continue at levels below their historic averages (excepting credit cards).Given this, if the latest trends are confirmed, the most probable estimation of growth projected for 2015 (3.6%) could be reduced.",
        "This revision would consider greater deterioration of national income and of exports, lower external financing, as well as cuts of public expenditure announced by the Government.",
        "All this will generate moderation of the demand, especially through lower levels of private investment.",
        "The amplitude of the interval (between 2.0% and 4.0%) reflects the uncertainty over assumptions on extreme scenarios.Regarding prices, inflation in February increased and registered 4.36%, a number higher than had been forecast by the market average and the technical staff at the Central Bank.",
        "Acceleration of inflation is explained mainly by the higher pace of increase in the prices of food, and secondly, by the increase in the annual change of the group of tradable goods excluding food and regulated goods.",
        "The average of core inflation completed five months increasing, registering 3.53%.Inflation expectations by the market analysts for December were increased from 3.3% to 3.6%, while those in a one and two year horizons remained relatively stable and registered 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds increased, and are still at the upper half of the target range.",
        "A good part of this last increment would be related to the increase of the inflationary risk premium.Depreciation of the peso versus the average of currencies with which Colombia trades was increased, and its pass-through to the sector of trandable goods of the CPI accelerated.",
        "Despite this, the impact on total inflation has been low, similar to the average observed in prior periods of nominal depreciations.",
        "This pass-through may be expected to continue in the next months, although its magnitude is uncertain and depends on many factors.",
        "In this context, the risk that the tradable sector of the CPI increases more than it was forecast persists, contaminating expectations and having a more persistent effect on inflation.In all, by the end of 2014, the Colombian economy slowed down, starting from an output level that was close to the full use of the productive capacity.",
        "Inflation increased mainly due to transitory factors, and its expectations are above 3.0%.",
        "Given that part of the reduction of oil prices and national income is lasting, a permanent adjustment of the internal expenditure of the economy is necessary AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlight that growth of the Colombian economy for 2014 (4.6%) was lower than the projection by the Central Bank (4.8%), while that for 2013 was revised from 4.7% to 4.9%.",
        "The Board expects growth for 2015 to be lower than the one registered for last year, and Board Members agree that this slowdown represents a necessary adjustment facing the new external conditions that led to a significant diminution of the terms of trade.",
        "Some Board Members consider this could have a strong negative impact on national income.",
        "Additionally, they mentioned that depreciation provides stimulus for exports and for the sectors that compete with imports, and contributes to moderate the negative impact of oil price on the external and fiscal accounts.",
        "Likewise, it increases prices in the short term, especially those of tradable goods.The Board Members also reiterated their commitment to maintaining inflation and inflation expectations anchored to the target.",
        "They coincided that in the short term total consumer inflation will continue showing upward pressures caused by temporary increases in the prices of food and, to a smaller extent, by the transfer of depreciation to the prices of tradable goods of the family basket.",
        "The pressure is expected to start yielding in the second semester, and inflation is foreseen to converge to the target (3.0%) in the policy horizon DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Bogotá,",

        "Household consumption consolidated as the main engine of this economy.",
        "According to projections by the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the first increase in the benchmark interest rate of the Federal Reserve would take place in December.",
        "On its part, the economy in the euro zone continues expanding at modest rates, also driven by domestic demandIn China, several indicators suggest a deepening of the slowdown, despite the policy measures implemented.",
        "Exports and imports continue to contract in yearly terms.",
        "The slowdown in this economy would continue to have negative effects on the performance of global activity, on trade, and on international prices of commoditiesNew data suggests that Colombia's main partners in Latin America will continue showing a very low dynamism, partly affected by the decline observed in the prices of raw materials.",
        "Particularly, it is expected that in 2016 Venezuela and Brazil register contractions in their product again, while countries such as Ecuador, Chile, Mexico and Peru would continue exhibiting lower growth ratesWith all the aforesaid, growth for Colombia's major trading partners in 2015 would be lower than had been forecast a quarter ago.",
        "For 2016, there would be a slight recovery, but slower than projected in the reportIn the third quarter, the price of oil was, on average, below the expectations of the technical staff.",
        "Factors such as the weakness of global demand, high inventories, and prospects of a high oil supply explained this behavior to a great extent.",
        "The prices of other commodities have also fallen.",
        "At the same time, the prices of goods imported by Colombia in US dollars have decreased beyond the forecast.",
        "This behavior of the prices of imported and exported goods has been reflected on a significant deterioration in the country’s terms of trade, which are at the lowest levels since early 2009.",
        "However, deterioration has been lower than estimated by the projections in theInflation Reportissued in JuneThis behavior of the prices of exports and the deterioration of the quantities exported (except for the main agricultural goods) were reflected on a decline in the value of exports in US dollars.",
        "In July-August, external sales fell 41.1% on a yearly basis, a decline explained mainly by the behavior of mining and by other exports different from major agricultural items.",
        "So far this year to August, total exports have fallen 33.8% on a yearly basisIn spite of the depreciation of the peso, the decline in the prices of imported goods in US dollars and a domestic demand which was not as weak as projected, would have explained in part a slower-than-estimated adjustment of imports in US dollars.",
        "In July-August, total imports fell 14.4% on a yearly basis, and so far this year to August they accumulate an 11.8% declineWith the above, it is likely that in the third quarter deficits in the trade balance and current account related to GDP would have accelerated.",
        "For all of 2015, an external deficit between 5.7% and 6.8% of GDP is expected, with 6.2% as the most likely figure.10.In Colombia, the most recent figures for the third quarter suggest that growth could have been better than expected.",
        "On the side of demand, retail sales (excluding vehicles) and the behavior of the consumption portfolio would indicate that household spending continues to be dynamic, despite the low levels in confidence indexes.",
        "Investment expectations show that investment different from works would maintain a yearly deterioration similar to the one recorded in the second quarter, while construction and works would continue to be dynamic.",
        "On the supply side, indicators for industry, trade and construction (cement production and licenses), among others, have performed better than expected.11.The unemployment rate continues at low levels, although the employment generation has deteriorated in recent months, particularly, that of formal salaried employment.12.Real interest rates for credits continue below their historical averages, and the evolution of the portfolio reflects a dynamic domestic demand.13.Considering the aforesaid, the Central Bank revised upward its most likely growth forecast for 2015 to 3.0%, within a range between 2.4% and 3.4% (the previous range was between 1.8% and 3.4%, with 2.8% as the most likely figure).",
        "For 2016 a similar growth rate is expected (3.0%), within a range between 1.5% and 4.0%.14.In September, annual consumer inflation stood at 5.35% on a yearly basis, surpassing market projections and those of the technical staff.",
        "All the main groups accelerated.",
        "The group of regulated items was the only one that posted within the inflation target range.",
        "Core inflation indicators increased again and are above the ceiling of the target range; their average (4.89%) is the highest since April 2009.15.All measures for inflation expectations increased in the last month and are higher than the long-term goal (3.0%).",
        "Particularly, those derived from public debt bonds are above the ceiling of the target range.In all, the sharp increases in the prices of goods that are mostly affected by the depreciation of the peso and by adverse weather conditions have continued pressing inflation upwards.",
        "Prices of other goods and services also show increasing variations, which may reflect indexation, expectations of higher inflation in the future, or pressures in costs in these sectors.",
        "The behavior of these prices does not seem to indicate the existence of a significant deterioration of aggregate demand.",
        "Thus, the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand beyond consistency with the decline in national income has moderated, in a context of increasing inflation expectations AND OPTIONSThe majority of the Board Members agree that the increases in inflation reflect not only the impact of transitory shocks attributable toEl Niñoand devaluation, but also the effect of higher inflation expectations and the existence of past excess expenditure which exerts pressures on the current account deficit of the balance of payments.",
        "The announcement of stronger and enduring conditions due toEl Niñothan initially forecast and uncertainty about the future behavior of devaluation and its pass-through to prices  have increased the risk of medium-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored form the target.",
        "They believe that an increase in the benchmark interest rate is necessary not only to anchor expectations, but to prevent inflation pressures or external vulnerability generated by excess demand.As for the magnitude of the increase in the benchmark interest rate, there were several opinions.",
        "The majority of members opined that the increase should be of 50 bp.",
        "In their opinion, the new data available of domestic demand and inflation expectations calls for a stronger reaction than the one taken in the previous meeting of the Board.Other co-directors, although sharing the macroeconomic diagnostics of the majority, consider that the appropriate policy decision is to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "In their view, this strategy would be suitable to deal with the current inflationary situation for the following reasons: (i) it is very likely that a path of increases in the benchmark interest rate be required.",
        "Considering this, a gradual and (if necessary) persistent adjustment of the reference rate would be preferable; (ii) this adjustment would allow to better calibrate increases in the benchmark rate according to the new information available, which is very useful within a scenario of high external uncertainty, as is the current case; and (iii) such a strategy facilitates communication with the market, allows for greater predictability of future rates, and improves the pass-through of monetary policy.One of the Board Members emphasized the transitory nature of the acceleration of inflation due toEl Niñoand to the variation of the exchange rate.",
        "Although there are no demand pressures, this member considers that if the objective is to control inflation expectations, a 25 bp increase accomplishes this purpose DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 5.25%.",

        "In China, the yuan was devalued, and drops in the stock market from historically high levels persist.",
        "As for the United States, there is still high probability of an increase in the benchmark interest rate of the Federal Reserve, and the US dollar continues to strengthenThe lower prospects of global growth, high levels of oil production and the increasing prospects for its supply once more generated falls in international oil prices.",
        "These new price levels are below the estimation by the technical staff for the average of 2015.",
        "Something similar happened with the prices of other mining commodities exported by Colombia.",
        "In this way, the fall in the terms of trade will continue to be important this year, with a negative and significant effect on national incomeLower prices of commodities and weakness in external demand have reflected on the behavior of Colombia’s external sales in US dollars.",
        "In the second quarter, exports continued recording important yearly falls (-32.6 %).",
        "In this period, the largest falls took place in external sales of mining origin (-43.3%), followed by the fall in exports of agricultural goods (-13.9%) and other sectors (-3.0%)The new foreign trade information continues to suggest that this year the current account deficit relative to GDP will be greater than the one registered in 2014.",
        "For the present year, the forecast interval remains between 4.8% and 6.4%, with 5.6% as the most likely outcomeAs for the domestic context, indicators of retail trade for the second quarter, confidence of consumers and commerce, as well as economic expectations from Banco de la República indicate that absorption continues slowing down.",
        "On the supply side, in the same period, the industry contracted and construction indicators suggest a slowdown in the sector.",
        "Data to July show a drop in consumer confidence and in oil production, while the production of coffee exhibited a significant increaseRegarding the labor market, the unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) stopped falling, and in yearly terms job creation slowed down.",
        "In June, excluding seasonal effects, the overall participation rate and the occupancy rate declinedReal interest rates decreased, registering below their historical averages calculated since 2000 (except for credit cards).",
        "Commercial lending has slowed down, while that directed to households improved its dynamics.",
        "Both types of credit are growing at rates higher than nominal GDP growthWith all of the above, the technical staff maintained its estimate for economic growth for the second quarter of 2015 between 2.0% and 3.5%, with 2.7% as the most likely figure.",
        "For 2015, the most likely outcome remains at 2.8%, within a range from 1.8% to 3.4%.10.In July, annual inflation increased slightly and stood at 4.46%, somewhat higher than estimated by the technical staff and by the market average.",
        "On this occasion, acceleration of the CPI excluding food explained the largest rate of increase of inflation.",
        "Other indicators of core inflation also rose and their average stood at 4.29%, thus accumulating ten months of consecutive increases.11.Inflation expectations by financial analysts to one and two years and those embedded in public debt bonds to more than two years increased.",
        "All these indicators are lower than the current inflation and are placed at the higher portion of the target range.In all, inflation remains above the upper limit of the target range and domestic expenditure in the economy continues adjusting to a lower dynamics of national income.",
        "Projections indicate that in the monetary policy horizon temporary price shocks will be reversed and the probable excess capacity will contribute to inflation converging to the target, within an environment of anchored inflation expectations.",
        "However, partial pass-through of the devaluation of the peso to prices and an eventual intensification of El Niño could slow down said convergence AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlighted that the Colombian economy has received a very strong shock associated with the fall in oil prices, which reduces growth and increases inflation in the short term, inasmuch as devaluation passes-through partially to prices.",
        "This increase in inflation is temporary as long as inflation expectations remain anchored close to the target set by the Central Bank.",
        "On the other hand, lower growth is the economy’s response to the adjustment needed in domestic demand facing lower national income, fruit of the negative impact in the terms of trade.For some Board members, recent information could suggest that output growth could be lower than expected by the technical staff, and, given the current anchorage of inflation expectations, they deemed appropriate to wait until having more information on the evolution of variables that may significantly affect the future behavior of productive activity and inflation expectations.",
        "For them, this new information will contribute to better balance the risks of higher inflation and excessive adjustment of economic growth, which in the short term are opposed within the decision regarding the stance of policy.Other members of the Board agree that recent data points at lower growth.",
        "This group opined that under these conditions, the most likely scenario is one in which excess productive capacity is generated within the policy horizon.",
        "This would bolster convergence of inflation to the target, and given the current anchorage of inflation expectations, it allows for the current policy stance to achieve its objectives.",
        "Similarly, they pointed out that, while inflation expectations are anchored to the target, the risks that they may no longer be so are mainly associated with the short-term dynamics of the exchange rate, which has a weak relationship with the intervention rate.",
        "Therefore, they considered essential to strengthen communication with the public regarding the nature of inflation and the mechanisms of convergence towards the medium-term target.Another group expressed that the upward pressure on inflation originated by the pass-through of devaluation on prices, however temporary, manifests itself more quickly than the disinflationary pressures from the slowdown in domestic demand and the excess productive capacity.",
        "This can cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, generating an upward spiral of prices and a situation of instability which would make drastic policy measures in the future unavoidable.",
        "This risk of unanchored expectations has grown significantly in a scenario in which total inflation has been above the upper limit of the target range for over one semester, and which has continued to increase (even excluding food inflation), and in which the average of core inflation indicators has risen for the tenth consecutive month and is also above the upper limit of the range.",
        "They also consider that, given the above, and a real interest rate close to zero in the last few months, early adjustments of the benchmark rate could avoid later hikes of greater magnitude.",
        "In their view, a 25 bp increase would contribute to prevent expectations from becoming unanchored by strengthening the credibility of the Central Bank DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by majority, considered maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.",

        "The economic recovery of the United States would be slower than estimated, while the product of the euro zone would expand at a lower rate.",
        "China would continue slowing down and the countries of the region would record weak or negative growth rates.",
        "If these forecasts take place, in 2015 external demand for Colombia would grow at a lower rate, somewhat below the one for 2014The lower international prices of oil and other commodities have pressured world inflation downward.",
        "This has contributed to the fact that in some developed countries consumer prices have not increased or register deflationThe European Central Bank continued providing monetary stimuli, while the Federal Reserve suggested in its last meeting that the possible increase of its interest rate would be more gradual than it was announced by the end of 2014.",
        "In this context, the long-term interest rates in said countries have lowered and continue at low levelsAppreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the majority of currencies has partially reversed.",
        "In the region, the risk premia lowered, having registered increases at the beginning of the yearIn the first quarter of 2015, the average oil price was somewhat below the levels registered by the end of 2014.",
        "In the same period, other commodities exported and imported by Colombia descended.",
        "Should all these prices continue, in 2015 the terms of trade would record low levels similar to those registered at the beginning of 2009.",
        "This fall in the terms of trade would generate a significant loss in the dynamics of national incomeThe previous behavior of external demand and of the prices of commodities has been reflected in the results of foreign trade.",
        "In the first two months of the year, exports in US dollars descended 34%, a fall explained mainly by those of mining origin (-47%), especially due to the lower price of oil.",
        "In the same period, external sales of the main agricultural products increased 22.5%, while those of the remaining sectors descended 11%So far this year, total imports accumulate a fall of 3.8%, due to the lower external purchases of intermediate goods (-18.4%).",
        "Imports of capital goods increased by 13.9%, and those of consumption increased by 1.3%.",
        "The increase in capital goods is explained by the 63.9% increases in transportation equipment and 4.1% in building materials.",
        "Within consumer goods, a fall of 3.2% in durable goods and an increase of 6.2% in non durables were registeredWith this information, the technical staff increased the forecast of the deficit of the current account as a percentage of the GDP for 2015, from a range within 3.3% to 5.5%, to one within 4.2% and 6.1%.",
        "The new most probable outcome for 2015 (5.3%) would be similar to the deficit observed in 2014 (5.2%).",
        "Nearly 0.9 percentage points of the estimation for 2015 would be explained by the lower GDP in US dollars, due to the greater level of the exchange rate.",
        "In US dollars, the deficit in the current account would be reduced because this assumes that the lower level of factor revenue and the reduction of the deficit of the service balance would partially offset the expansion of the trade deficit.",
        "As for financing, forecasts consider a reduction in foreign direct investment, especially in the mining and energy sector, and lower portfolio inflows.",
        "This comes from a lower base of comparison for 2014, when significant inflows of this nature took place as a result of an increased weighing of Colombian public bonds in some reference indexes of emerging marketsAs for the domestic context, the new information for the first quarter of 2015 indicates that the economic activity would be less dynamic than the one registered in the last quarter of 2014.",
        "The information of retail trade, consumer confidence, and the survey of economic expectations, indicate a slowdown of consumption and private investment.",
        "On the side of offer, the fall of industrial production and cattle slaughter, smaller growth of non-regulated energy demand, and the downturn in the present and future perception of trade indicate that economic growth will continue slowing down.",
        "As for other activities such as oil, coffee and cement, other data suggest good behaviors.10.Regarding the labor market, the figures to February 2015 show that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate continues at historically low levels, with a dynamic occupation rate which is explained mainly by salaried employment.11.In the first quarter of 2015, total corporate and household debt grew at a rate similar to the one registered in December 2014, rates that surpass the increase of the nominal GDP estimated for the present year.",
        "Corporate debt in foreign currency (direct and banking) slowed down again, a fact that has been compensated by a better pace of increase of commercial credit in pesos and in bonds.",
        "Household debt portfolio slowed down slightly, mainly due to the lower dynamics of the mortgage loan.",
        "This took place together with increasing credit interest rates, although in real terms they continue at levels below their historic averages (excepting credit cards).12.With all this, the technical staff considers that growth during the first quarter would register between 2.0% and 3.5%, with 2.7% as the most probable outcome.",
        "For all of 2015, the most probable growth figure was revised downward, from 3.6% to 3.2%, within a range of 2.0% and 4.0%.",
        "The amplitude of the interval reflects uncertainty over assumptions in possible extreme scenarios.",
        "In turn, the most probable value considers a lower dynamics in national income and a reduction of external financing, which could moderate expenditure, especially through a lower level of private investment.13.Regarding prices, inflation in March increased, reaching 4.56%, a number somewhat higher than the forecast by the market average and the technical staff at the Central Bank.",
        "Acceleration of inflation was explained mainly by the greater pace of increase in the prices of food and those of tradables excepting food and regulated goods.",
        "The average of core inflation completed one semester increasing, reaching 3.65%.14.Inflation expectations by market analysts and those derived from public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are within a range of 3.1% and 3.6%.In all, the slowdown that started by the end of 2014 from an output level that was close to the full use of productive capacity is expected to continue in 2015.",
        "Inflation increased mainly due to transitory factors, and its expectations are above 3.0%.",
        "Given that part of the reduction of national income is structural, domestic expenditure of the economy must adjust AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agree in that 2015 will bring a slowdown in product growth, but they differ in the magnitude of the slowdown.",
        "While some Board members expect a GDP growth close to 3.0%, others believe that it could be closer to 3.5%, or even higher.They emphasized that the lower growth of domestic expense, complemented by import substitution, and, with a longer lag, by greater exports as a result of the real depreciation of the peso, are part of a necessary adjustment of the Colombian economy to the new external conditions.",
        "In time, this adjustment will bring a lower external imbalance and, consequently, will contribute to preserve the necessary conditions for sustained economic growth.The members of the Board agreed that total consumer inflation has exhibited upward pressures caused by temporary increases in the prices of food, and, to a lesser extent, by the pass-through of depreciation to the prices of tradable goods of the CPI basket.",
        "It is expected that the pressure begins to yield in the second semester, and for inflation to converge to the target (3.0%) within the policy horizon.",
        "The importance that medium-term inflation expectations continue to be anchored to the target, as has been the case up to now, is emphasized.For some Board members, growth in 2015 would reach levels close to 3.0% due to a slowdown of domestic demand and to a slight recovery in exports other than oil.",
        "Previous projections included growth in these exports, which has not yet materialized; it is more likely to expect an increase in this item consistent with a total GDP growth of 3.0%.",
        "Considering the magnitude of the external shock, a 3.0% GDP growth would represent a positive result for the economy, as long as it comes with a reduction of external vulnerabilities.Other Board members consider that GDP growth in 2015 will be closer to 3.5%, or even above.",
        "The increase of external demand that will take place mainly with the recovery of the US and Europe, the positive effects of depreciation on the agricultural and industrial sectors, the contribution of consumption and public investment (already financed by the government), and the dynamics shown by employment and credit, among others, allow to foresee that the slowdown and necessary adjustment of the economy, associated to the fall in the terms of trade, will take place in an orderly way, thus allowing the country to reach a remarkable growth rate within the Latin-American context.One Board member reiterated a growth forecast of 3.0% of the GDP for 2015, with a downward bias.",
        "This member stated that the main source for the inflation increase, which has led the policy interest rate to a negative territory in real terms, has been that of food inflation, caused by a transitory shock in supply.",
        "Additionally, this Board member added that it may be expected that by the end of 2015 total inflation will be near the upper limit of the target range, and that along 2016 it would converge towards 3.0%.",
        "Therefore, in spite of the apparent slowdown of the economy and the return of the product gap to negative, the nominal policy interest rate should be maintained unaltered at least for the remainder of the year.",

        "The US dollar resumed its trend towards appreciation, but with a lower slope than the one observed at the beginning of the year.",
        "So far this year, among the main countries of the region with an inflation targeting scheme, the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso have been the most depreciated currencies vis-à-vis the US dollarSo far in June, the prices of oil exhibited levels higher than the projections for all of 2015, but they are still far lower than the average observed in the last five years.",
        "The average of the prices of goods imported by Colombia has descended, but at a slower pace that the fall of the prices of exports.",
        "This behavior indicates that in 2015 the level of the terms of trade will be low and similar to the one registered at the beginning of 2009, and that there will be a significant loss in the dynamics of national incomeThe behaviors of external demand and the prices of commodities have impacted the results of foreign trade in US dollars.",
        "In annual terms, the value of exports descended again in April.",
        "This fall is mainly explained by mining exports, especially by the lower level in the price of oil in comparison to a year ago.",
        "In the same month, external sales of the main agricultural products and other sectors also descended.",
        "Within the accumulated value for the four first months of the year, total exports in US dollars have fallen 29%; mining exports have fallen 40.2%, and those of other sectors -9.4%; contrastingly, the external sales of agricultural products increased 16.9%In April, total imports in US dollars fell 18.2% on a yearly basis.",
        "The major fall was exhibited by those destined to capital goods (-23.2%), followed by raw materials (-17.5%) and consumer goods (-12.3%).",
        "With this, external total purchases accumulate a fall of 8.1% in the first four months of 2015, which is explained by the downturn of imports of raw materials (-16%), of consumer goods (-2.0%), and to a lesser degree, of capital goods (-1.0%)The behavior of exports and imports and that of other items of the balance of payments indicate that in the first quarter of 2015 the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP would be greater than the one registered for all 2014As for the domestic context, growth in the first quarter of 2015 (2.8%) slowed down, in line with the estimations by the technical staff.",
        "Domestic demand grew at a slower pace than in the previous quarter, but at a rate greater than what had been projected due to the dynamics of investment.",
        "Net exports fell, and their negative contribution to growth resulted higher than had been estimated, as a result of the strong increase of real importsOn the supply side, in the first quarter of 2015 the most dynamic sectors were works, retail, repairs, restaurants, and hotels, financial establishments, insurance, and real estate activity.",
        "In turn, the manufacturing industry and exploitation of mines and quarries were the only sectors that presented a downturn in their activity.10.The new data for the second quarter of 2015 regarding retail trade, consumer confidence, and the survey of economic expectations by Banco de la República suggest that private consumption grows at a somewhat lower rate than the one registered at the beginning of the year.",
        "On the supply side, production of the manufacturing industry contracted again in April.11.As for the labor market, the data to April of 2015 recorded a slight increase of the unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted), but its level is still historically low.12.In May, total corporate debt grew at a somewhat higher rate than the one registered for the first quarter, while that of household debt continues slowing down.",
        "Both balances grow at a greater rate than the increase of the nominal GDP estimated for 2015.",
        "This has taken place together with interest rates (for trade and consumption), which in real terms continue at levels below their historic averages (excepting credit cards).13.Regarding prices, inflation decreased in May, reaching 4.41%, a figure lower than had been forecast by the market average and the technical staff at the Central Bank.",
        "The slowdown of inflation is explained mainly by the lower pace of increase in the price of foodstuffs.",
        "The other groups of the family basket, (, regulated goods, and tradable and non-tradable goods excluding food and regulated goods) accelerated, and their rates of increase are in the upper rank of the target range.14.The average of core inflation completed eight months increasing, registering 3.99%.",
        "One and two-year inflation expectations by market analysts and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5-year horizons are still between 3.0% and 3.5%.In summary, the slowdown that began in late 2014 continues in 2015.",
        "Inflation decreased, and its expectations are still near 3.0%.",
        "Domestic expenditure continues its process of adjustment due to the slowdown in national income AND OPTIONSThe Members of the Board consider that the new information available corroborates that the process of orderly adjustment referred to in previous meetings continues taking place, marked by a gradual reduction in the growth of domestic demand and output.",
        "All this is in line with the convergence of inflation to the long-term target and contributes to the reduction of the current account deficit of the balance of payments.Regarding prices, the Board Members emphasized that annual inflation reduced, but core inflation indicators increased.",
        "The increase in the prices of some of goods and services has exhibited a greater-than-expected persistence, which has raised inflation forecasts for 2015.",
        "However, good anchorage of inflation expectations and the spare capacity that will be generated as a result of the slowdown of the output allow foreseeing that inflation will converge to the target in the policy horizon.The Members of the Board also indicated that the current account deficit of the balance of payments poses vulnerability to the Colombian economy.",
        "The lower growth of domestic demand and the real depreciation of the peso are necessary elements to gradually reduce it.Finally, the Board Members highlighted that flexibility of the foreign exchange rate is a fundamental element of the inflation targeting scheme, which allows for the exchange rate to absorb external shocks.",
        "This policy framework has enabled the Colombian economy to face the shocks in the terms of trade and the volatility of international financial markets DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.Bogotá,",

        "In the United States, domestic demand grows at favorable rates, while GDP in the euro zone continues increasing modestly.",
        "China's economy continues its slowdown; in Brazil, the recession would have deepened, and the other large countries in Latin America grow at rates lower than those observed in previous years.The probability of the FED increasing its benchmark interest rate in December rose, the US dollar appreciated, the long-term bond rates increased, and the prices of the main commodities lowered.",
        "The price of oil was below the expectations of the technical staff at Banco de la República, and the terms of trade continue at low levels.In the third quarter, exports fell (-41.9% on a yearly basis) more than imports (-17.2% on a yearly basis) resulting in a widening of the trade deficit greater than had been forecast by the technical staff.In Colombia, retail sales (except motor vehicles) for the third quarter show that household consumption would have been more dynamic than expected.",
        "However, net exports would have subtracted from output growth.",
        "On the supply side, construction would have had a positive dynamics, according to the indicators of production and shipment of cement.",
        "Similarly, industrial production shows a growing trend.The unemployment rate remains low, although a slight reduction in the number of occupation was observed in the quarter (in the national total and in the thirteen areas).",
        "The seasonally adjusted series do not show a clear trend.The information available for the fourth quarter is still scarce.",
        "On side of demand, the consumption portfolio recorded a moderate slowdown in nominal terms, while the consumer confidence index showed a slight recovery in October, although it is still low.",
        "On the supply side, the figures for oil and coffee production are in line with the expectations of the Economic Studies Division of the Central Bank, and the surveys show improvement in the trend of industrial confidence orders and stock indicators, as well as in the perception of the current situation of trade.",
        "However, the six-month prospects of trade maintain a negative trend.With all of the above, the technical staff maintained its forecast range for economic growth for 2015 between 2.4% and 3.4%, with 3.0% as the most likely figure.In October, annual consumer inflation stood at 5.89%, higher than expected by the market average and by the technical staff at Banco de la República.",
        "The acceleration in the month was explained by the greater pace of increase in food prices, mainly perishable, and by the behavior of the group of tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "Despite the sharp increase in the rates of public utilities, the group of regulated items was the only that pulled inflation downwards, due to the behavior of fuels.",
        "All the indicators of core inflation picked up again and their average stood at 5.11%.In the last month, all the measures of inflation expectations monitored by the technical staff increased.",
        "Those obtained from the survey to financial analysts to one and two years stood at 4.41% and 3.55%, respectively.",
        "Those obtained from public debt bonds posted above the ceiling of the target range for all periods.It is expected that in the coming months, the effects of El Niño on agricultural production and electric energy continue pushing the prices of food and public utilities upwards.",
        "Similarly, the pass-through of the depreciation of the peso towards domestic prices may continue, generating additional increases in production costs, particularly in the group of tradables.",
        "These shocks, which are transitorily increasing inflation, may affect inflation expectations, causing several mechanisms of indexation of prices and wages to operate with greater intensity than in earlier periods, and generate a slower convergence of inflation to the target.In summary, inflation expectations have increased and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, beyond that which is consistent with the decline registered in national income, has moderated AND OPTIONSAll Board Members agree that the Colombian economy has experienced a strong impact on income derived from the fall in the international price of oil, generating a substantial depreciation of the peso, which is necessary to achieve a sectoral re-orientation of spending and production, leading to the adjustment of the country’s external accounts.Due to its magnitude, devaluation has increased inflation of consumer prices.",
        "This increase has been reinforced by other supply pressures, especially on food.",
        "Both shocks, although temporary, have been stronger and more persistent than initially forecast, diverting inflation from its target for a longer period of time.",
        "The forecasts show that it will begin to converge towards its target in the second semester of 2016.Meanwhile, the adjustment of domestic demand facing the impact in the terms of trade has been lower than expected, exhibiting reinforcement in the last quarters of the year.",
        "This factor has not contributed as much as expected to the reduction in the current account deficit, causing the economy’s external vulnerability to continue raising concerns.",
        "In this scenario, all the members of the Board agree that it is necessary to continue tightening the monetary policy, although there are differences about the pace of increase of the benchmark interest rate.The majority of the Board members consider that it is appropriate to continue the tightening process of the monetary policy, seeking to reduce the growth of domestic demand and strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "The monetary policy acts with a forward-looking approach.",
        "Within an environment in which the economy continues to face changing external conditions, these members believe that announcing a path of continuous 25 bp adjustments is appropriate.",
        "A path of increases strengthens the signal of the Board's commitment to inflation targets, allows to better calibrate an optimal response to new external shocks, and makes the movements of the Board of Directors more predictable for the market, thereby improving the pass-though of monetary policy.The credibility of the monetary authority must be sustained by a consistent and weighted action looking towards the policy horizon.",
        "The willingness to follow a path of increases in the benchmark rate that is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within this horizon is the best strategy to underpin credibility.",
        "A coherent policy should be the guide to adjust medium-term inflation expectations, despite the fact that the volatility of the short-term data will most likely persist for some time.The other members of the Board consider that it is essential to consolidate credibility of the monetary policy as long as domestic demand is not weak and still contributes to generate vulnerability in the economy by the high deficit in the current account of the balance of payments.",
        "They consider that credibility is further consolidated with a 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate than with a 25 bp increase in this meeting of the Board.",
        "They argue that a 25 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate in this meeting will weaken the signal sent and the credibility obtained from the 50 bp increase of the previous meeting, and that it would be unfortunate to have to make efforts to gain credibility in the future, after the domestic demand has weakened.The credibility of the monetary policy could suffer more due to some foreseeable supply shocks in the future.",
        "Particularly, the imminent increase in the benchmark interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve tends to strengthen the US dollar and reduce the prices of oil, resulting in a higher devaluation of the peso and consequential pressures on inflation expectations.",
        "Also, the effect of El Niño on food supply and the prices of some regulated services will further increase inflation, and could additionally affect inflation expectations.Finally, one of the members from the group that proposed a 50 bp increase stressed that annual inflation to October (-5.9%) doubles the target, is the highest in six-and-a-half years, and has remained above the upper limit of the target range over nine consecutive months.",
        "Certainly, food inflation (-8.8%) has been the main inflationary factor.",
        "However, this pressure is not only caused by food.",
        "Excluding food, inflation went from 2.9% a year ago to 4.8%.",
        "Excluding food and regulated items, it doubled, having moved from 2.6% to 5.2%.",
        "Besides, the average of the Core inflation increased by thirteenth month in a row, moving from 2.8% a year ago to 5.1%.",
        "The persistence of the increase in all Core inflation indicators suggests demand pressures.",
        "Expectations are unanchored from the goal, and the large current account deficit shows no signs of abating DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.5%.Bogotá,"

        "Minutes of the Banco de la Republica Board of Director’s meeting on February 24, 2012 On February 24, 2012, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica was held in the city of Bogota with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the Governor and Managing Director Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, as well as the perspectives for both situations are discussed, and decisions relating with the monetary policy are adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the major subjects addressed at this meeting Annual consumer inflation was 3.54% (0.73% monthly), 19 basis points (bp) less than in December.",
        "The decline in inflation during the month was the result of lower pressure on the baskets of tradables excluding food and regulated items, of regulated prices and of food.",
        "The basket for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items (3.6%) not show any changes compared to what was seen in December 2011.",
        "In the specific case of the prices in the basket for tradables excluding food and regulated items, a decline of 8 bp was seen with respect to the result in December (0.8%) thus interrupting the upward trend it has experienced since September 2011.",
        "This suggests that the appreciation of the peso since January 2012 may be having an effect on this variable.",
        "The annual change in the prices for regulated goods, in turn, went from 5.8% in December to 5.2% in January, a fall that was larger than expected.",
        "This was possible because of the fact that, at the beginning of this year, there were no readjustments in the Transmilenio fares in Bogota unlike what happened last year.",
        "In the area of utilities, however, there were significant changes in the rates for electricity and natural gas added to the ones observed in previous months.",
        "In the case of natural gas, for some time now, there has been enough capacity to transport it and that has made it difficult to meet the demand on the Caribbean coast in particular.",
        "With respect to the prices for food, the drop in the annual change that occurred in January was significant as it went from 5.3% in December to 4.9%.",
        "The production of various perishables, especially potatoes, has gone back to normal and allowed the prices to fall and the annual change in this subgroup to drop.",
        "There were also few adjustments in the prices of products like oil and this could be due more to the appreciation of the peso than to movements in international prices which have not declined.",
        "Because of that, the annual change in the CPI for processed food items also fell this month.",
        "The above mentioned changes more than offset a new upswing in eating out (from 5.6% in December to 5.9% in January).",
        "The annual variation of the prices in the basket of non-tradables excluding food and regulated items remained stable at 3.6%.",
        "However, in the case of rent, its heaviest component, there was a new rise which came to 3.5% in January compared to 3.4% in December.",
        "This item has been showing an uninterrupted upward trend for the last nine months.",
        "All of the indicators of core inflation declined slightly thus temporarily suspending the rising trend that has been experienced for five months.",
        "The average of the three indicators monitored by the Banco de la Republica was at 3.3%, which is a decline of 15 bp with respect to the month before.",
        "In spite of the drop in total consumer inflation, expectations not change substantially.",
        "Those from the monthly survey for December and for 12 months ahead remained at 3.6% in both cases.",
        "Those derived from the TES at different maturities remained close to 4%.",
        "Although wage adjustments had tended to be compatible with the inflation target up until December, the 5.8% raise in the minimum wage for 2012 increased the risk that pressure from the cost of wages would arise.",
        "Added to this is the fact that the labor market is not expected to be as weak in 2012.",
        "In January of this year, the upswing in the prices for eating out and health services above what had been registered last year could be a symptom of both phenomena.",
        "In contrast, non-salary costs saw a reduction in January when the significant decline in the annual change in the PPI to 3.7% in comparison to the 5.5% in December is taken into account.",
        "This indicator has fallen for three months straight and, especially in January, this was due to the appreciation of the peso and the better conditions in agricultural supply Growth The most recent information indicates that domestic demand continued to expand at a good pace towards the end of 2011 and had a dynamic beginning of the year.",
        "The favorable performance of household consumption in the fourth quarter of last year was confirmed by the changes in imports and employment in December.",
        "That month the dollar value of imports of consumer goods grew 9.6% in annual terms.",
        "This is a high rate but lower than in previous months.",
        "The labor supply, in turn, continued to show improvements with respect to the creation of job positions and the reduction in unemployment, which should have a positive effect on consumption.",
        "In December, there was an upswing in the number of people employed on the national level and in the 13 metropolitan areas.",
        "Even if there was a slight rise in the unemployment rate in the 13 metropolitan areas that month, it is still premature, with the limited information available, to suggest a break in the downward trend seen in 2011.",
        "The information available as of December on imports also makes it possible to expect positive results for investment.",
        "In the last month of 2011, the dollar value of imports of capital goods expanded 36.6% with respect to the same month the previous year and is well above the average since 1994 (12.7%).",
        "With respect to supply, the industrial production data published by ANDI which showed a growth of 5.9% in 2011 stands out.",
        "Other sectors such as commerce, transportation, and construction are also expected to have continued a positive momentum to the end of 2011.",
        "For example, the regional survey done by the Banco de la Republica (businessmen from various sectors are included in this) showed a very favorable perception of sales growth in December.",
        "The production of cement also continued to grow in December which suggested that construction was doing well.",
        "Sales abroad continued growing in December.",
        "In dollars, the value of the exports again registered a sharp surge (43% annually) which was primarily due to exports from the mining sector (petroleum, coal, nickel-iron and gold) which jumped 55.3% annually.",
        "Foreign sales of the main agricultural products (coffee, bananas, and flowers) dropped 8.3% annually due to the poor coffee harvest.",
        "The rest of the exports climbed in December and came to 43% annually.",
        "For the first quarter of 2012, the limited information available points to a production performance that is similar to what had been seen towards the end of last year.",
        "According to Fedesarrollo, household confidence grew for the third consecutive month in January 2012 and was close to its historical maximums from the series (since 2001).",
        "Car sales, in turn, grew at an annual rate of 13% in January.",
        "This was an upswing for the second consecutive month and a new record in sales for the month.",
        "Likewise, the Fenalco survey for January showed that businessmen’s perception of sales remained high while their expectations for six months from now are even better.",
        "In addition, households in January continued to have a real interest rate for consumption that is lower than the average has been since 1998.",
        "As a result, household consumption is expected to continue its positive trend.",
        "With respect to investment, positive growth can be expected although a little lower than was expected for the second half of 2011.",
        "The above is inferred from the developments in the commercial loan portfolio, which rose at an annual rate of 17.2% in national currency and 36.5% in foreign currency in the first month of 2012.",
        "At the same time, businessmen still had real interest rates that were lower than the averages since 1998 in spite of the rise last month (40 bp).",
        "Given all of the above, the growth forecast for the fourth quarter of 2011 is still within a range between 5% and 6.2%.",
        "With these estimates, the possibility that growth for 2011 will be within the forecasted 5.6% to 6% range remains feasible.",
        "For the first quarter of 2012, the scant information points to growth that will be similar to or slightly lower than that of the fourth quarter of 2011 Financial Variables Total loans in national (NC) and foreign currency (FC) remain at high rates of growth with a slight moderation starting in July 2011.",
        "All of the types of loans, including those for households and businesses, continue to show growth that is well above the growth of economic activity.",
        "This has occurred in a context of real interest rates that are historically low.",
        "As of January, total loans (NC and FC) registered an annual rise of 20.9%, which is 27 bp lower with respect to December and 247 bp compared to July.",
        "The performance of the commercial loan portfolio, which saw a growth of 19.1%, a rate that is 40 bp lower than the one for the previous month, gave it an accumulated reduction of 425 bp in the last six months.",
        "The consumer and mortgage loan portfolios, in turn, saw growth rates that were 24.8% and 17.3% respectively.",
        "These levels have been close to their averages since July 2011 (25.1% and 17.2%).",
        "In January, the real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) for consumer, mortgage, and ordinary commercial loans were at 16.9%, 10.2%, and 8.8% respectively.",
        "These figures are lower than the averages that have been seen since 1998 (except for the rate for mortgage loans for which the average has been calculated only since May 2002) Foreign Context The new data on worldwide economic activity show a slowdown in foreign demand in line with what has been expected as a result of two important factors: on the one hand, the high levels of government debt and, on the other, the process banks are going through to reduce leveraging.",
        "This is limiting access to credit in the advanced economies and affecting the strength of consumption and investment for the private sector.",
        "In this context, the forecast for 2012 is negative economic growth in Europe while, in the United States, the rate could be somewhat lower than its potential.",
        "There will also be a lower pace of economic activity in the emerging countries as a result of the weakening of global demand.",
        "Because of the above, it is probable that the average growth of our trading partners this year will be lower than what was observed in 2011.",
        "In the specific case of the United States, the growth of output rose in the last quarter of the year as it went from 1.8% (a/q) in September to 2.8% (a/q) in December.",
        "The labor market continues to improve and industrial activity is still expanding.",
        "Nevertheless, the slowdown in exports and weakening in household expenditures indicates that the economy is not on the path to sustainable growth yet.",
        "For 2012, the economic growth of this country is expected to be lower than its historical average.",
        "In the Euro zone, in turn, the weakening of productive activity was generalized and, with the exception of France, the largest economies contracted in the last quarter of 2011.",
        "During this period, the output shrank 1.3% (a/q), a trend that could even extend into the first half of 2012.",
        "However, so far this year, some signs have been seen that suggest that the deterioration will not continue to worsen and that it will be in line with what was predicted.",
        "First of all, the increase in the liquidity support on the part of the European Central Bank has contributed to reducing the interest rates for Spain’s and Italy’s government bonds.",
        "Interbank liquidity and risk perception also improved.",
        "In the case of Germany, the business and consumer confidence indicators showed a slight recovery in January.",
        "With respect to Greece, the new rescue package was approved by the European economic authorities.",
        "In spite of all of the above, the uncertainty about the depth and duration of the recession in Europe remains high.",
        "Credit is still restricted and the unemployment rates in some countries in the region, which were already historically high, have continued to climb.",
        "Moreover, the risk that poor results from the economic activity will push the risk indicators up again and raise doubts about the euro’s stability persist.",
        "In Japan, the GDP declined in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a consequence of the drop in exports and higher energy imports.",
        "The slowdown in worldwide demand and the interruption in the supply chain from Thailand caused by the October floods would seem to be affecting the recovery of this economy.",
        "In contrast, the productive activity in the emerging Asian economies, except the case of Indonesia, continued slowing down at a moderate pace in response to the lower strength of global demand and to the adjustments in monetary policy in 2010 and beginning of 2011.",
        "In some Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela, the indicators of productive activity improved in the last few months of 2011.",
        "The lower strength of world demand has alleviated the inflationary pressures in both the developed and emerging countries.",
        "Nevertheless, recent supply shocks such as the droughts in South America and Mexico as well as the rise in geopolitical tensions have pushed up the prices of food products and petroleum.",
        "In conclusion, the new data show a global demand that is slowing down in line with what was estimated and a global inflation that has given way.",
        "This new information will contribute to keeping the external interest rates at low levels for a long period of time.",
        "So far, the slower pace of economic activity that Colombia’s trading partners have has not been reflected in a decline in the value of exports.",
        "On the contrary, foreign industrial sales excluding mineral and agricultural commodities surged.",
        "Furthermore, the upswing in the price of petroleum could lead to the terms of trade remaining at high levels which are above the estimated average for this year AND The majority of the Board members thought it appropriate to raise the policy interest rate considering the following factors: (i) Recent information indicates that, in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Colombia economy continued to show strong momentum and that this performance has been maintained over the course of the year as reflected by exports, imports of capital goods, retail sales, etc.",
        "(ii) The output gap is probably still in positive territory.",
        "(iii) The industrial confidence index is still at high levels while consumer confidence has remained on a rising trend for several months and is at one of the highest historical levels.",
        "(iv) Something similar is happening with respect to the terms of trade (fed to a large degree by the price of petroleum), which have also reached unprecedented heights.",
        "(v) Even if inflation has recently shown a trend that is more in keeping with the long term target and the measurements of core inflation declined in January for the first time in several months, neither the forecasts nor expectations of inflation show a clear convergence yet towards the -point of the target range on the political horizon.",
        "(vi) Uncertainty about the future changes in the exchange rate makes it difficult to estimate its impact on inflation in the future.",
        "(vii) Even if the transmission of previous adjustments in the policy interest rate to the market ones have been adequate, the recent limited slowdown in the loan portfolio does not necessarily eliminate the risks of a dangerous boom, especially in consumer credit.",
        "(viii) The above points make it necessary to ensure that the market interest rates continue to move towards long term levels that will make it possible to ease the trend of both credit and GDP and thus avoid the risks of financial instability with high costs in terms of production and employment.",
        "(ix) Even if the risks of a possible uncontrolled adjustment of the situation in the euro zone stay the same, measures that were recently adopted in that region make it possible to give more weight to the local conditions of the Colombian economy in the policy decision.",
        "These conditions are characterized by factors that have shown that so far they have not been affected by the situation in the advanced economies Other members not think it was appropriate to raise the benchmark interest rate at this time for the following reasons: (i) The Board’s change of posture to reduce the monetary stimulus started as of February 2011 has had the expected effects.",
        "These effects will continue to extend, because of their natural lag, into the rest of this year and the next one.",
        "Therefore, additional adjustments to the benchmark interest rate could turn out to be inopportune.",
        "(ii) In December 2011, annual inflation in Colombia (3.73%) was the lowest among the main economies in the region even though it was in the upper half of the target range.",
        "In January 2012, inflation ended up at 3.54% after falling for three consecutive months.",
        "All of the core inflation indicators fell for the first time in five months.",
        "Inflation excluding food dropped 13 bp and ended up at 3%.",
        "Inflation of non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices remained unchanged.",
        "There is evidence of lower pressure on non-salary costs given that, in January, they continued the decline that had started three months before.",
        "(iii) It is estimated that the investment share of the GDP for 2011 may have reached the historic record of 30%, which makes it possible to infer that the potential GDP has also grown beyond its historical trend and is consistent with the current economic performance.",
        "(iv) Global demand continues to slow down.",
        "Europe went into recession.",
        "The slow recovery of the United States is keeping its economy below its potential GDP.",
        "Worldwide inflation is still dropping.",
        "The two previous factors have led to the general adoption of lax monetary policies characterized by interest rates that are historically very low and prolonged.",
        "(v) Geopolitical factors have begun to cause obvious surges in the prices of petroleum which could begin to have a negative effect on the performance of the North American economy and bring additional recessionary problems on the rest of the world.",
        "Finally one board member proposed that macro-prudential measures be applied to speed up the transmission of monetary policy to demand Based on the present evaluation of the balance of these risks, the Board of Directors decided to raise the benchmark interest rate of the Banco de la Republica by 25 basis points.",
        "With the recent increases in the benchmark interest rate, the market rates are expected to approach their historical averages more rapidly and inflation expectations to converge towards the -point of the target range.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation, the inflation trend and projections, growth, the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota , March 9, 2012",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on November 23, 2012.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and the full-time co-directors Messrs. Fernando Tenjo, Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan José Echavarría, Juan Pablo Zárate and César Vallejo.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made in relation to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting    BACKGROUDa.",
        "Recent developments in inflationAnnual consumer inflation was at 3.06% in October, a figure that is similar to what was seen the previous month (3.08%).",
        "From the beginning of the year to October, the accumulated rise in the CPI has been 2.48%, which is significantly lower than what was registered for the same period in 2011 (3.15%).",
        "This suggests that there is a high probability that the inflation target will be met this year.The performance of the main subgroups of the CPI in October was very similar to what it was last month.",
        "Within the CPI excluding food, the annual change in the prices for the basket of tradables excluding food and regulated prices was close to 1.1% in October.",
        "This level has been maintained for several months and is consistent with the stability in the exchange rate.",
        "The annual variation in the CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices remained at 4.0% with its main component, rent, rising 7 bp compared to the previous month and ending up at 4.9%.",
        "In the group of non-tradables, items such as education and health services have seen adjustments since the beginning of the year that are over 4.0%.",
        "These have been offset by the lower increases in the prices of other services related to entertainment, culture and recreation, and other services.Regarding regulated items, the prices in this basket rose 3.3% in October in comparison to those registered during the same month last year.",
        "This data is similar to that for September.",
        "Fuel began to put on upward pressure again (it rose 120 bp to 4.4%) but utilities followed the opposite trend (they dropped 62 bp to 2.0%) due to the discounts on electricity fees that partially compensated for the upswings the month before.The CPI for food rose 3.6% compared to what had been registered for the same month last year.",
        "The decline in the international prices of various food items such as coffee, sugar, a few fats and oils, and grains would have allowed moderation in the adjustment of domestic prices for processed food for which the annual change went from 4.3% to 3.7% between September and October.",
        "In October, a smaller decline in the annual change of the CPI for perishable food (from -2.4% to -0.6%) was seen.",
        "Eating away from home showed an adjustment of more than 5.0%, which is similar to previous months.Core inflation not show significant changes either this last month.",
        "A record of 3.11% was seen for the average of the four indicators monitored by the Banco de la República.",
        "This is slightly lower than the one for September (3.16%).",
        "Since November of last year, this variable has shown few changes as it fluctuated within a range between 3.0% and 3.2%.The annual variation of the total PPI in October was -1.1%, a record that is lower than the one for September.",
        "The PPI for imports stayed in negative territory due to the stability of the exchange rate and the declines in several prices for raw materials.",
        "The annual change in the PPI for locally produced and consumed goods dropped from 0.6% in September to -0.5% in October.",
        "This situation makes it possible to foresee lower pressures on inflation for the next few months.With respect to inflation expectations, according to the monthly survey done of analysts in financial entities, the inflation expected for December of this year is 3.0% and, in twelve months, 3.2%.",
        "This shows no changes with respect to last month    GrowthIn September, mixed signals on the performance of economic activity were seen.",
        "Indicators such as indicators of retail sales excluding vehicles showed a significant upsurge while industrial output continued to deteriorate just as had been predicted.",
        "Add to this the unanticipated contraction of imports of capital goods and the lower growth of exports.The Fedesarrollo consumer confidence index, in turn, based on the figures for October remained at levels similar to those seen in September.",
        "It was also higher than the data from October last year and than the average calculated since 2001.",
        "This suggests that household consumption is maintaining a buoyancy similar to that of its historical average (4%).",
        "Even so, the most probable case is that annual growth in this period has been lower that what was seen in the first half of the year partly due to the high base of comparison.In addition, the monthly regional survey that the Banco de la República does showed that the trend component of sales expectations for a 12-month horizon rose between July and September after having dropped in the first half of the year.",
        "The expectations for job creation from the same survey show a similar trend.In the area of private investment, even if the information is scarce, the results of capital goods imports as of September suggest a weaker performance by this aggregate than what had previously been projected.",
        "These purchases fell 24.2% in comparison to the same month last year.",
        "Excluding airplanes, the drop was 15.2%.",
        "The slump in purchases of industrial machinery, which fell 26% annually compared to the same month last year, is notable and stands in contrast to the positive rates from the months of July and August (20% on average).In the month of September, the total exports in dollars grew 4.9% in comparison to the same month last year (6.1% if the re-export of airplanes is included).",
        "Foreign sales continued to be led by those of petroleum while sales of coal fell again and industrial sales remain at a standstill.",
        "Furthermore, exports of agricultural products showed a 7.7% drop compared to the same month the year before given the lower value of the coffee and banana exports.",
        "Even if the annual growth this month of total foreign sales were higher than the sales in August, the annual rates of growth for the last few months are lower than what was seen in the first half of the year.Within the indicators in the area of supply, it is noteworthy that, according to DANE, industrial output excluding coffee threshing registered an annual change in September of -1.3%.",
        "The indicators for confidence, orders, inventory, and expectations in the Fedesarrollo survey of industry in September together with the sector’s demand for electricity for October suggest that the contraction of industrial output will be prolonged.The latest figures for the agricultural and mining sectors are positive.",
        "According to the Coffee Federation, coffee production will probably have grown in the third quarter at a rate that is slightly above 20% annually.",
        "Petroleum production in September and October likewise registered a significant recovery after the poor results from the previous four months that were attributed to supply shocks.In conclusion, the growth of the Colombian economy has slowed down based on rates that were seen to be above their trend levels in the second half of 2011.",
        "After an annual growth of 4.8% in the first half of 2012, recent indicators of economic activity suggest that growth is moderating a little more than expected.",
        "The weakness of the global economy and the decline in domestic demand have been reflected in the more limited growth of exports and the contraction of industrial production.",
        "The growth range of the GDP predicted for 2012 is between 3.7% and 4.9% with 4.3% as the most probable rate.",
        "For 2013, a growth rate close to the growth of productive capacity is expected    Financial VariablesThe moderation in bank credit (N/ and F/C) which has been characteristic so far this year continued in October.",
        "Its annual rate of growth was 15.3%, 43 bp and 221 bp lower in comparison to what was seen last month and in June respectively.The annual growth of the commercial loan portfolio in national currency went from 16.9% in June to 14.2% in October while the component in foreign currency followed suit the same month at 6.2%.",
        "The consumer loan portfolio showed a similar trend with growth rates of 22.2% and 18.9% in the abovementioned months.",
        "The slowdown in the mortgage portfolio, in turn, has been less accentuated with variation rates of 16.4% and 15.6% in the same period.The real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) for the October disbursements for consumer, mortgage, and ordinary and preferential commercial loans were at 15.6%, 9.9%, 9.0%, and 5.6% respectively.",
        "These levels are lower than their respective averages calculated since 2000.",
        "In contrast, the real interest rates for credit cards and the treasury bonds were at 26.5% and 5.3% which are higher than the averages calculated since 2000    Foreign ContextIn general terms, global activity has developed in line with what was expected in the last few inflation reports.",
        "International uncertainty remains the same due to the risk of a deepening of the crisis in Europe and a possible contraction in the United States in 2013 because of the “fiscal cliff.”  The latest information available points to a lower probability of a slowdown in the Chinese economy.In the euro zone, the GDP contracted again during the third quarter.",
        "The information available for the fourth quarter of the year (indices of purchases, confidence indices, etc.)",
        "indicates that the contraction in economic activity will probably continue into the fourth quarter.",
        "It is noteworthy that the situation in the countries on the periphery will be drawing strength away from Germany and France where a slowdown is expected for the last quarter of the year.In the United States, expansion has followed a modest pace as evidenced by the performance of retail sales, exports, and industrial activity.",
        "However, it should be noted that the real estate market has continued to recover and for the coming quarters it is expected to contribute positively to growth although still at a low level.In the case of Latin America, the indicators of productive activity show limited growth for the Brazilian economy while Chile and Peru continue to expand at a favorable rate.",
        "The Mexican economy is slowing down.",
        "Even though the Venezuelan economy grew, a significant slowdown is expected for the next year.Currencies and risk perception towards economies in the region have not demonstrated significant changes in an environment of monetary stimulus implemented by the developed countries.The international prices for petroleum have remained relatively stable for the last few weeks.",
        "Nevertheless, the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could cause them to rise again.",
        "Prices for food with the exception of wheat have reversed the -year peak.In Colombia, the terms of trade which had declined towards the middle of the year recovered in September and October and are at historically high levels.",
        "This is due to the high prices for petroleum and the lower rate of price adjustment for imported goods.The low inflationary pressures and negative output gaps continue to allow the developed countries to maintain an expansionary monetary policy.",
        "The emerging economies have shown economic growth that is better although below their potential with benchmark interest rates that are around the natural one.",
        "This situation is expected to continue in 2013.In the future, the largest risks are still a strong recession in Europe with negative and significant impacts on the terms of trade, confidence, and the aggregate demand of Colombia.",
        "The possibility that the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States will occur also continues to be a threat.",
        "This could have significant negative effects     AND OPTIONSThe board members’ main points of discussion and analysis focused on the following aspects:(i) The international uncertainty continues.",
        "Some international economic indicators have improved a little.",
        "The weakness in a significant number of industrialized economies and the lack of inflationary pressure allow us to expect that foreign interest rates will remain low for a prolonged period of time.",
        "(ii) Colombian growth has slowed down based on rates that were seen to be above their trend levels in the second half of 2011.",
        "After 4.8% annual growth in the first half of 2012, the recent indicators of economic activity suggest that growth is moderating a little more than expected.",
        "The weakness of the global economy and the decline in domestic demand have been reflected in the more limited growth of exports and the contraction in industrial production.",
        "The predicted range of GDP growth for 2012 is between 3.7% and 4.9% with 4.3% being the most probable result.",
        "(iii) For 2013 moderate but sustained growth in foreign demand for Colombian products, stable levels in international prices, and expansive conditions of international liquidity are expected.",
        "Investment will continue to be driven by public works due to the lower interest rates and the expansion of mining-energy projects.",
        "Thus, the growth in 2013 is expected to be close to the growth of the productive capacity.",
        "(iv) The growth of credit is still slowing down.",
        "Indices of prices for new and used housing are at historically high levels.",
        "(v) Inflation, the average of the indicators for core inflation, and inflation expectations are very close to the -point of the target range (3%).",
        "(vi) The major risks in 2013 to economic activity in the country are still a significant recession in Europe or the possibility that there could be a sharp fiscal cutback in the United States.Some of the members proposed reducing the benchmark interest rate based on several considerations.",
        "While inflation and inflation expectations are on the long term target, industrial indicators, imports of capital goods, and sales of durable goods suggest that the economy could be slumping more than expected in comparison to its potential level of growth.",
        "Furthermore, in spite of the fact that reductions in the benchmark interest rate seem to be transmitting to the market suitably, the risk perception local agents have remains high.The other members thought that the benchmark interest rate should be kept unaltered considering the following points: Even if the growth of demand has declined over the course of the year, this has occurred starting at a point of levels of unsustainable growth of private expenditure in the second half of 2011.",
        "There is no evidence in the available information that the expenditure adjustment has been or is on its way to being greater than what is required to keep output and employment close to sustainable levels.",
        "Even if credit has dipped, financing for companies and households is growing at a positive pace and in a manner that is consistent with a suitable performance for domestic demand.",
        "The real interest rates with the exception of credit cards are similar to those this country saw in the first half of 2010 and which were shown to be expansionary.",
        "Both inflation and inflation expectations as well as the inflation predictions for this year and the coming one are at around 3%.",
        "Even though the levels of uncertainty regarding the worldwide economy remain high, the news and international indicators available this last month show an outlook that is a little more favorable for 2013 than the one seen at the previous Board meeting.",
        "Something similar has occurred with consumer confidence and a few other indicators.",
        "They also believed that their stance was based on the assumption of significant investments in construction and public works projects as well as the existence of terms of trade that sustain high levels of national revenue     DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the current balance of risks, the Board of Directors decided it would be suitable to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 4.5%.",
        "Based on current information, this is the interest rate level that is compatible with close to productive capacity growth and compliance with the inflation target.The Board reiterates that the Banco de la República has sufficient tools and resources to cover liquidity needs in national and foreign currency that the economy regularly requires and those that could appear in an environment of international financial turbulence.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Director’s Meeting of 29th June 2012 Annual consumer inflation in May stood at 3.44%, which means 1 basic point (bp) above the previous month record.",
        "This result can be explained by an increase in the annual variation of the CPI without foods which shifted from 2.81% in April to 2.94% in May, and a 29-bp reduction in the annual variation (4.72%) as compared with the previous month figure.",
        "Year to date, a CPI increase of 1.92% has accrued, lower than the increment seen during the same period in 2011 (2.2%).",
        "In the CPI without foods, the annual variation increase was due to a significant acceleration of the annual CPI for regulated items in the last month (from 3.83% to 4.42%).",
        "This fact was explained mainly by the energy price increase.",
        "As for fuels, the lowest international oil quotation has begun to be transferred to the domestic gasoline price, the annual variation of which fell from 5.7% in February to 3.7% in May.",
        "The other CPI sub-baskets without foods, as well as the tradables and non- tradables sub-baskets showed small changes in May without actually affecting the performance of annual inflation in a significant manner.",
        "While annual variation of tradables rose from 0.91% to 0.96%, the non- tradables variation fell from 3.77% to 3.74%.",
        "Leases kept rising (5 bp) on a continuous basis for over a year, and finally stood at 3.7% in May.",
        "The annual variation of the CPI for food fell from 5.01% in April to 4.72% in May.",
        "This behavior has been explained by the perishables group that, in the same period, declined from 4.68% to 1.18% thus suggesting that the conditions of the farming supply have tended to go back to normal.",
        "On the other hand, rises were originated in the processed foods sub-baskets (rice among others) and out-of-home meals.",
        "Core inflation indicators experienced a slight increase.",
        "The average of three indicators monitored by Banco de la Republica closed at 3.35%, which means 5 bp above the previous month.",
        "In May, the annual variation of the PPI declined from 1.56% to 0.80%, and kept on declining since the fall commencing last October.",
        "In the past two months, the variation of the PPI for imported items (-1.1%) has began to be less negative, in line with the lower peso appreciation recorded in April and May.",
        "In contrast, the annual variation of the local PPI (1.2%) continued to go down during May, which reflects the slower adjustment rhythm of the PPI for farming, as well as for industry, and mining.",
        "Inflation expectations deriving from the TES (treasury securities) at different horizons declined in the past month and are standing around 3%, while those obtained from the month survey not show significant changes: inflation expected as of December is 3.3%, and 12-month inflation is 3.5% Growth In the first quarter of 2012, the Colombian GDP grew 4.7% in annual terms, this figure standing at the lower part of the forecast interval established by Banco de la Republica’s technical team.",
        "In this manner, the national economy actually registered decelerations in its growth rate for two full quarters after an expansion of 7.5% in the third quarter and 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "As compared with the previous three-month period, a new slowdown was registered considering that the annual growth of the GDP shifted from 5.1% at the end of the previous year to 1.1% in the first quarter.",
        "By spending type, this slowdown in the GDP was explained mainly by a moderation in investment dynamics by shifting from an annual growth of 14.2% in the last quarter of 2011 to 8.3% in the first quarter of 2012.",
        "Within this aggregate, the fall (8.1%) registered in works stood up, as explained to a great extent by a drop corresponding to the oil and mining sector.",
        "Investments in transportation equipment and machinery also record downturns, but they are growing again at high rates since 2000, above their averages.",
        "Building construction was the only investment component having experienced acceleration, since it grew from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 4.5% in the first quarter of 2012.",
        "Likewise, a slowdown in the annual growth rate was observed in household consumption.",
        "This aggregate, with a 5.9% expansion (as opposed to 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011) was the variable having contributed the most to the GDP performance, and it continued to grow at a rate higher than its average since 2000.",
        "Household spending in the first quarter of 2012 was driven mainly by both purchases of non-durable goods and service dynamics.",
        "On its side and for a second consecutive quarter, durable goods consumption reached an annual expansion rate lower than its average since 2000.",
        "Government consumption continued to show moderate growth, in this manner becoming the less dynamic aggregate on the demand side.",
        "As a result of the above, domestic demand grew at and annual rate of 6.1% in the first quarter.",
        "In the first quarter, a sharp annual growth reduction was registered in exports and imports, where the growth rate for the latter shifted from 21.3% in the fourth quarter of the previous year to 13% in the first quarter of 2012, and from 16.2% to 6.3% in the case of external sales.",
        "The combined contribution of both aggregates to GDP growth was negative (- 2.2 pp).",
        "On the supply side, the branches having contributed the most to the annual growth of the first quarter’s GDP were, in this order, financial and leasing services, mining and commerce, restaurants and hotels.",
        "In the mining and manufacturing industry sectors, less expansion records were witnessed.",
        "In the case of mining, slowdown was due to supply problems.",
        "The growth rate of industrial GDP shifted from 3.9% in the last quarter of 2011 to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2012.",
        "The agriculture and construction sectors experienced annual drops, due to lower coffee production in the case of agriculture and to the behavior of works in the case of construction.",
        "With respect to the economic situation for the second quarter, most part of information available shows a slowdown in the economic activity.",
        "In April, industrial production contracted in annual terms for two consecutive months.",
        "With respect to construction, the area approved of according to construction licenses continued to register annual setbacks.",
        "Demand indicators suggest ongoing deceleration in household consumption in the second quarter, in this way getting closer to its average growth in 2000 (4.0%).",
        "This slowdown can be inferred from data relating to commerce sales (which fell 2.8% in annual terms in April) and imports (consumption goods sales in dollars grew 6% in April after having grown nearly 10% in March).",
        "Homes confidence in quarterly terms has declined slightly as compared to the first quarter of the year.",
        "Colombian exports in April registered an amount of US$ 4.886 billion and grew 4% in annual terms.",
        "This growth rate is lower than that observed in previous months (22.5% on average between January and March), and it can be explained by a 41.7% reduction in agricultural exports, a 9% fall of industrial exports without basic goods, an a more reduced annual growth rhythm (11.5%) in external sales of mining origin.",
        "By products, oil and oil by-products grew 19.4% in annual terms in April, thus offsetting the 20% fall in coal sales.",
        "As for exports of coffee, banana, and flowers, they experienced reductions of 57%, 10.9% and 18.7% respectively.",
        "On its side, the fall of industrial exports was due to less sales of foods and beverages (-15.6%), chemicals (-9.8%), and textiles (-16.4%) Financial Variables The total national and foreign currencies (“MN” and “ME”) portfolio registered in May an annual increase of 17.7%, lower by 70 bp than in April and 346 bp as compared to December 2011.",
        "This behavior was determined by the commercial loan portfolio, the growth of which stood at 15.3%, 60 bp lower than the previous month’s rate, thus contributing to a year-to-date slowdown of 420 bp.",
        "As for the annual growth of the household portfolio, consumption declined from 25% in March to 22.1% as of Junes.",
        "On the other hand, the mortgage portfolio exhibited an annual 16.9% growth in May.",
        "Real interest rates in May (excluding CPI without foods) for consumption, mortgage and ordinary commercial credits, in that order, stood at 15.9%, 10.2% y 9.0% In the second quarter of 2012, the real activity and confidence indicators show a slowdown in global economy.",
        "In the United States, information suggests a slower growth rhythm, while in the eurozone, as well as in England, the economic activity continues to deteriorate.",

        "China and India, like other developing Asian economies, have also deteriorated.",
        "In Latin America, Brazil continued to exhibit lower rates quarter after quarter and, as of March, its GDP annual growth approached zero.",
        "In the United States, real activity indicators have continued to expand, though the last information available evidences some slowdown signs.",
        "Recent data from the labor market indicate that the recovery taking place in the first months of the year might cease to make satisfactory progress in the second semester.",
        "Thus, in June, both consumer confidence and sentiment indices in the manufacturing sector weakened.",
        "On the eurozone side, although the economy not shrink again in the first three months of the year, some real activity indicators available for the second quarter evidence that the region has continued to weaken.",
        "For this reason, a GDP contraction is highly likely in this period.",
        "In addition, starting in May, uncertainty grew in international markets due to a recrudescence of political and financial tension in the eurozone.",
        "The likelihood of large-sized economies like Italy being threatened by contagion grew, thus increasing risk perception significantly in the international financial markets.",
        "The results of the recent elections in Greece, along with the commitment of the European Union to rescue the Spanish banking system were only a temporary relief of the markets’ nervousness, since they cannot see short- term measures capable of stabilizing the economy and leading it towards recovery.",
        "The evolution of the agenda over better fiscal and financial integration would determine the way risk perception will behave in the next few months.",
        "If these discussions are carried out in a fast and credible manner, uncertainty could be expected to decrease.",
        "The entrepreneur and consumer confidence indices remain depressed, while sentiment indices in the manufacturing and service sectors have worsened.",
        "The deterioration of economic prospects and signs indicating that they might get worse in the short term could jeopardize even more recovery opportunities in the developed countries.",
        "All the above keeps at high levels the risk of the European periphery’s economies, impairs confidence, and might drag the eurozone down to a drop in its output even higher than projected by the markets.",
        "The reduced European dynamism has began to affect the behavior of the emerging economies in Asia as reflected in the weakening of both exports and industrial production, and accentuating the ongoing slowdown they had been exhibiting since -2011, generated by the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus policies Except for Indonesia, the April 2012 figures of industrial production in the major emerging Asian economies show deceleration.",
        "For the specific case of China, industrial production, retail sales, and investment growth have been moderate in the past few months.",
        "In India, economic growth has decreased in a significant manner in the past few quarters, and the real activity indicators for the second evidence the continuation of this tend.",
        "In the Latin American economies, the economic growth of Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela was favorable in the first quarter of the year, as opposed to the situation in Brazil where, once again, real activity has decelerated.",

        "Growth in Chile and to a lesser extent in Mexico has decelerated.",
        "The world’s economic slowdown has reduced pressures upon international commodity markets.",
        "Oil and food prices have decreased in a significant manner in the past few months.",
        "In this context, monetary policy in the advanced economies remains lax and no hardenings are to be expected in the next few quarters.",
        "Conversely, if the global environment deteriorates further, central banks in this group of countries could implement better encouragement measures.",
        "To this date, the most recent data show that the main effects on the Colombian economy of the European crisis and the global economic slowdown have been deteriorating in external sales which would give way to growth deceleration in the tradables sectors other than mining, and a lower oil price that would adversely affect the terms of trade.",
        "With respect to the latter, the index observed as of May is still kept at high levels, in part as a consequence of the lower international price for imported goods.",
        "To this date, other channels through which the national economy might suffer ( external financing, internal confidence and country risk) have not been significantly affected AND By a majority, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to keep the policy interest rate unaltered, considering the following factors: (i) Global growth declined in the second quarter of the year.",
        "In the United States, information suggests a lower growth rate while in the eurozone several indicators show that the economy is shrinking.",
        "Problems in this region have affected global economy prospects through both confidence and trade and capital flows.",
        "The emerging economies exhibit a more moderate expansion rhythm reflecting mainly in the weakening of exports and industrial production.",
        "(ii) In Colombia, like in other emerging countries, the global economy weakening effects have been felt in lower demand and export prices.",
        "This has lead particularly to growth deceleration in the tradable sectors other than mining.",
        "Both industrial production in March and April and the agriculture GDP in the first quarter of the year have shrunk.",
        "(iii) Civil works construction fell in the first quarter, a phenomenon not having been envisaged in the Bank’s projections.",
        "In contrast, the financial, commercial and transportation and communications sectors exhibited significant dynamism propelled by growth in domestic demand, which has been encouraged by the favorable confidence and financing levels.",
        "(iv)Generally, Colombian economic growth in the first semester has been lower than expected.",
        "The GDP growth figure in the first quarter stood close to the upper limit of the forecast range carried out by the Bank’s technical period for this period.",

        "The core inflation average, just like the mean of inflation expectations one-to five-year ahead, stands at a rate slightly higher 3%.",
        "Some Directors highlighted the dynamic growth of private domestic demand, as well as the dynamism of foreign direct investment inflows, and a stable unemployment rate despite deterioration in the international environment, particularly in the eurozone.",
        "They stressed that neither financing nor confidence and country risk have been significantly affected regardless of the reduction experienced in the national exports by reason of both lower prices and amounts, and a growth slowdown above projections.",
        "They deemed that inflation expectations are close to the - point of the target range, and economic growth is not far from its potential.",
        "They pointed that even if credit dynamics became more moderated in the past few weeks, financial unbalance dangers and risk- taking in the economy have not vanished; this would likely affect employment and output growth sustainability in the medium term.",
        "Other Directors said that, according to information available, ongoing international deterioration can be foreseen for a prolonged period of time, with adverse effects on domestic demand and the terms of trade.",
        "In the internal sphere, more deceleration than expected has been observed in the agriculture and industry sectors which are the most important contributors to formal employment in the country.",
        "They are of the opinion that monetary policy effectiveness lies on the authorities’ anticipation ability; therefore, in this scenario, a stance relaxation phase must be undertaken in order to prevent drastic adjustments in the future.",
        "Consequently, they have proposed a 25-bp reduction in the intervention rate According to the assessment of the current balance of risks, the Board of Directors has decided to keep the intervention interest rate unaltered.",
        "The new information shall permit to establish new monetary policy actions.",
        "The Board confirms that Banco de la Republica has both the tools and sufficient resources to meet the liquidity needs in local and foreign currencies usually required by the economy, as well as those likely to be felt in an environment of international financial turbulence.",
        "The Board will continue to carefully watch over the international situation, inflation behavior and projections, as well as growth and the performance of asset markets; and it restates that monetary policy will depend upon the new information available.",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República Held on March 23, 2012 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Annual consumer inflation was 3.55% in February.",
        "This is similar to the rate posted the month before and below the December figure.",
        "In terms of monthly variations, the outcome was 0.61%, which is in line with the technical team’s expectation and less than the market forecasts, on average (0.78%).",
        "The drop in annual inflation during February was largely the result of another reduction in the annual variation in the CPI for food, which went from 4.9% in January to 4.7% in February.",
        "The non-food CPI (3.1%) showed an increase of 10 basis points (bp) compared to the figure for January.",
        "Annual variations within the food basket were down in all the categories influenced by favorable supply conditions and by the appreciation in the exchange rate.",
        "However, despite the reductions, the annual adjustments in eating out (5.7%) remained high and surpassed those of last year.",
        "The upward pressures within the non-food CPI remained concentrated on prices for regulated services.",
        "The annual change in prices for this basket rose by 31 basis points over the previous figure on record.",
        "The annual increase in the price of gasoline was 5.7% by February, conceivably associated in part with high international fuel prices.",
        "Energy prices also continued to rise, posting an annual increase of 8.9% during that month.",
        "In terms of the CPI for residential natural gas, although February witnessed a reduction compared to January, the cumulative increases of past months mean the annual variation is still above 17%.",
        "There were no significant changes during February in the CPI for tradables and non-tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "In the first case, the annual variation stayed at 0.7%, slightly below the figure observed in December.",
        "The halt in the upward trend in this indicator during the last two months is partly attributable to the appreciation in the exchange rate.",
        "As for non-tradables, the annual variation was 3.70% as opposed to 3.64% the month before.",
        "In this case, one sees the continuation of a very gradual upward trend that is consistent with the momentum in internal demand.",
        "The acceleration in rental fees persists, with an annual variation of 3.5% by February.",
        "With respect to educational services, the readjustment in February enrollment fees surpassed 4.5%, which was higher than expected.",
        "These two groups were offset, in part, by declines in cultural entertainment and recreational services and by the relatively slight increases in financial services.",
        "The core inflation indicators also showed no major changes in February.",
        "The average of the three indicators tracked by Banco de la República came to 3.27%, which is similar to the average witnessed in January (3.26%), but less than the figure in December of last year.",
        "Therefore, demand would have exerted some upward pressure so far this year, together with fuel prices.",
        "Inflation expectations declined in February.",
        "According to the monthly survey of market operators, total inflation anticipated by December and February 2013 would be approximately 3.5%, which is 10 bp less than the rate expected a month earlier.",
        "The reduction was slightly more (around 30 bp) in the case of expectations based on TES rates.",
        "The latter were 3.4% for different horizons.",
        "According to DANE, the annual increase in Colombia’s GDP was 6.1% by the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "Coupled with minor revisions in data from the other quarters during the year, this implies 5.9% growth for 2011 as a whole.",
        "The expansion in the economy last year was marked by favorable performance on the part of domestic demand.",
        "This aggregate rose 8.8%, which implies a build-up of more than three percentage points with respect to the rate observed in 2010.",
        "It also is similar to the growth on record for 2006 and 2007, both of which were economic boom periods.",
        "Despite a slowdown, domestic demand showed considerable momentum, having increased by 7.9% as opposed to 9.8% during the third quarter.",
        "Household consumption was the component of demand that contributed the most to GDP growth.",
        "It came to 6.5% for 2011 as a whole.",
        "This is more than in 2010, thanks largely to acquisitions of durables and semi-durables, which averaged an increase of 20% during the year.",
        "Relatively speaking, non- durable goods and services not perform as well (with nearly 5% growth), but surpassed their average as of 2000.",
        "Private consumption during the fourth quarter (6.1%) performed much as it during the rest of the year, while government consumption was up by 3%.",
        "The second component in terms of contribution to growth was investment in fixed capital, which rose 16.6%.",
        "This is the second highest rate since 2000, exceeded only by the increase in 2006.",
        "Spending on capital goods slowed somewhat during the fourth quarter of the year, largely because of a high basis of comparison.",
        "As was the case throughout the year, this item was bolstered considerably by purchases of transport equipment and machinery and equipment.",
        "Investment in building construction and works surpassed 6%.",
        "After having dropped 4.4% during the first half of the year, it rose 13.3% in the second.",
        "Imports and exports posted record high growth rates in 2011.",
        "The first of these aggregates was up by 21.5% last year, thanks to capital goods, raw materials and consumer goods, in that order of importance.",
        "Exports also quite well, having increased by 11.4%, particularly due to the performance of traditional exports (coffee, crude oil and derivatives thereof, coal and ferro- nickel).",
        "Foreign sales of other products also were satisfactory.",
        "The fourth quarter saw a build-up in total exports (15.8%) compared to the first three quarters of the year.",
        "On the supply side, good performance throughout 2011 in the mining and transport and telecommunications sectors was a high point.",
        "Mining was bolstered by the expansion in crude oil production and by a major increase in coal output during the latter half of the year.",
        "The good results in the second case originated with notable performance in air transport and in the telecommunications sector.",
        "Other sectors with vigorous growth were commerce, construction and financial services, while electricity, gas and water constituted the weakest performing branch of economic activity throughout the year, although this sector show positive growth.",
        "Agricultural- livestock production dropped during the final quarter of 2011(-2%), placing growth for the entire year at 2.2%.",
        "As a result, it was the sector with the second lowest rate of expansion in 2011.",
        "In the case of industry, growth during the year as a whole came to 3.9%.",
        "With respect to the economic situation in the first quarter of 2012, the figures on hand point to good performance.",
        "Household consumption continues to be favored by consumer confidence, which is relatively high, despite the decline witnessed in February.",
        "This is according to measurements taken by Fedesarrollo.",
        "The annual increase in household borrowing by February (25% for consumer loans and 17% for mortgage lending) suggests good momentum in private consumption.",
        "The developments in the job market also appear to indicate the growth in consumption can be maintained, since the unemployment rate (UR) in January 2012 was the lowest of the last decade with respect to rates posted for that same month.",
        "This figure confirms the downward trend observed in the UR as of -2011.",
        "Added to this is the 4.9% expansion in retail sales during January, which was less than last year but close to the average increase (6%) on record since 2000.",
        "According to the Colombian Automotive Committee, annual growth in vehicle sales was 7.2% by February.",
        "The dollar value of exports posted an annual increase of 24% in January, primarily due to exports originating in the mining-energy sector (29.9% annual growth) and industrial exports (14.9% annual increase).",
        "However, foreign sales of the country’s leading agricultural products declined at an annual rate of 19.2%, given the drop in exports of coffee and bananas.",
        "Some of the indicators on the supply side point to good momentum at the start of 2012.",
        "The annual increase in total demand for energy came to 6.3% by February, a rate not seen since 2010 and one that could be due, in part, to a low basis of comparison last year because of maintenance at Cerro Matoso.",
        "On the other hand, raw material imports accelerated sharply in January (by 19%), offsetting the drop witnessed the month before and suggesting that entrepreneurs in a number of sectors anticipate a rise in production.",
        "Finally, in industry, the Fedesarrollo business opinion survey with data at January continued to show high order levels and important expectations of production increases.",
        "Nevertheless, the production figures released by DANE for last month show a rate of 2.4%, which is the same as in December and less than the average for 2011 (4.8%) Financial Variables Annual growth in total lending ( and FC) came to 20.4% by February, which is 46 bp less than in January and 292 bp less than in July 2011.",
        "This performance was lead by the commercial loan portfolio, with 18.8% growth, which is 30 bp less than the month before and adds up to a slowdown of 455 bp during the course of the last seven months.",
        "The momentum in the consumer and mortgage loan portfolios has stabilized, with respective annual variations of 24.7% and 17.4% by February, which are near the average growth rates observed since July 2011 (25.1% and 17.3%).",
        "In February, real interest rates (discounting the non-food CPI) on consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial loans were 15.8%, 10.1% and 8.7%, in that order.",
        "These are less than the respective average rates calculated since 1998 (excluding the average mortgage lending rate, which has been calculated since May 2002) The External Context The new data on global economic activity show foreign demand is weak but somewhat better than was forecast at the end of last year.",
        "Even so, average growth this year for Colombia’s trading partners would still be less than it was is 2011.",
        "In Europe, the latest measures adopted by the authorities to deal with national debt problems in the peripheral countries has partly restored the confidence of international financial markets and lessen the likelihood that the financial crisis in the region will intensify even further.",
        "The outcome for the two largest Eurozone economies: Germany and France, has been more favorable and this could indicate the recession forecast for that region might be milder than was anticipated initially.",
        "Moreover, the European authorities approved a new rescue plan for Greece in recent weeks, which was followed by a voluntary haircut on Greek bonds taken by private investors.",
        "The massive waves of liquidity the European Central Bank has pumped into the region’s commercial banking system have alleviated the banks’ short-term liquidity needs and supported government bond issues in Spain and Italy, countries whose risk premiums have declined the last few months.",
        "At any rate, there has yet to be an increase in commercial lending, since commercial banks are still reluctant to deliver recourses to the private sector.",
        "In the United States, the new figures are better than anticipated.",
        "As a result, most analysts have raised their forecasts for that country’s growth during 2012, but at a rate that is still below its potential.",
        "The US economy continued to recover at a better-than-expected pace, bolstered by added growth in manufacturing and improved job-market performance.",
        "However, despite the recent positive signs, there are risks that could negatively affect this growth in the coming months, such as the possibility that the latest rise in oil prices will persist.",
        "In Japan, despite the slowdown in exports at the end of 2011, industrial production by January of this year showed signs of recovery.",
        "As for the emerging market economies, the growth rates witnessed in the final quarter of 2011 were close to those for the long term, and 2012 should see this performance continue.",
        "The figures at hand point to a moderate slowdown that would be in line with the forecast.",
        "In China, for example, the government decided to lower the target for growth in 2012 from 8% to 7.5%.",
        "In Latin America, the fourth-quarter figures ratified the slowdown in economic growth.",
        "However, the rise in raw material prices, the increase in domestic demand and the improvement in economic performance worldwide suggest this trend will not intensify.",
        "On the other hand, the sovereign risk premiums in Latin America declined slightly last month and the region’s currencies gained strength.",
        "If these risk levels and the abundance of global liquidity are maintained, capital flows to the economies in the region could continue and Latin America’s currencies would become even stronger.",
        "In terms of commodity prices, the tensions in the Middle East and North Africa have contributed to the rise in international oil prices, which have surpassed the highs witnessed in 2011.",
        "The prices of other commodities such as wheat, corn and soybeans, among others, also increased during the early months of the year, primarily because of factors related to the weather.",
        "In conclusion, the latest information indicates global demand remains weak, although somewhat less than expected.",
        "Nevertheless, the high prices for oil and other commodities observed in recent weeks could have an adverse impact on prospects for recovery in the developed economies.",
        "Despite the inflationary risks posed by the rise in commodity prices, central banks the world over are expected to keep monetary policy loose in an effort to stimulate economic growth.",
        "Up to now, the various channels through which the European crisis and less world growth could pass through to Colombia show no sign of contagion.",
        "In terms of confidence, the latest indicators for industry and consumers remain high.",
        "As for the commercial channel, exports were still growing at a good pace by January, especially those of mining origin.",
        "Moreover, the latest figures in the exchange balance reflect continued vigor in foreign direct investment, particularly for the mining sector AND The Board of Directors was unanimous in its opinion that the policy interest rate should not be changed, considering the following factors.",
        "(i) In February, annual inflation (3.55%) remained stable with respect to the month before and has been declining since October of last year.",
        "The core inflation rates still averaged around 3%.",
        "These factors and recent action taken with respect to monetary policy helped to lessen inflation expectations, which are expected to continue to converge towards the middle of the target range.",
        "(ii) Economic growth during the fourth quarter of 2011 (6.1%) and for the year as a whole (5.9%) ratifies the robust expansion in the economy.",
        "The momentum in domestic demand, which had tended to grow from one quarter to another, slowed at the end of the year to a rate of 7.9%, which is what it was at the start of 2011.",
        "The sharp increase in aggregate spending for several quarters has led to a situation where demand is using up the installed capacity in various sectors of the economy.",
        "(iii) The recent slowdown in industrial manufacturing growth and several other figures released during the first quarter of 2012 suggest growth during that period may not live up to the figure posted at the end of 2011.",
        "The new data will allow for more certainty as to whether the momentum in domestic demand is consistent with sustainable economic growth and with accomplishing the inflation target.",
        "(iv) Growth in lending remains high, especially in the case of consumer loans.",
        "This indicates households have considerably higher levels of indebtedness.",
        "(v) Although the last 12 months have seen a rise in real and nominal interest rates on loans, they are still below their averages calculated since 2000, except in the case of interest on credit card lending.",
        "(vi) On the external front, the forecasts for 2012 point to negative economic growth in Europe, while the United States could post a rate slightly below its potential.",
        "The emerging market economies might not grow as much, but would expand to an extent near their long-term rate.",
        "For these reasons, Colombia’s trading partners likely will see less average growth this year than in 2011.",
        "(vii) International oil prices continue to rise and prices for the other commodities Colombia exports remain high.",
        "Consequently, terms of trade are at record highs and are fueling the growth in national revenue.",
        "At the same time, peso appreciation may be affecting the performance of certain tradable sectors.",
        "(viii) There is still the risk of a severe recession in Europe, with significant adverse effects for economic activity in Colombia, but the likelihood of it occurring has declined in recent weeks.",
        "(ix) The risks to inflation that come from expectations have eased somewhat.",
        "Those that can originate with the performance of demand or lending remain in effect.",
        "Given the data now at hand, and even considering the recent trend in inflation, several Board members noted that inflationary pressures continue to weigh on the risk balance, which means additional adjustments in monetary policy might be necessary.",
        "Others felt the neutral range of the Bank’s intervention rate has been achieved already and, given the lag that exists in the movement of interest rates and their full impact on demand, they believe any remaining inflationary pressures would be controlled in the near future with the measures adopted so far.",
        "Finally, one of the Board members reiterated the need to establish a reserve requirement for consumer lending to complement the changes already made in Banco de la República’s intervention rate.",
        "Based on this risk assessment, the Board of Directors decided to leave Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate unchanged.",
        "New information will make it possible to determine any further action to be taken with respect to monetary policy.",
        "The Board will continue its careful monitoring of the international situation, the trend in inflation and its forecasts, growth, and the way asset markets perform.",
        "It reiterated that monetary policy will depend on whatever new information becomes available.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on April 30, 2012.",
        "In attendance were Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor and Managing Director of Banco de la República, and full-time co-directors Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan José Echavarría, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zárate and César Vallejo.",
        "Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summaryof the main topics addressed at that meeting BACKGROUNDa.",
        "Recent Developments in InflationAnnual consumer inflation was 3.4% in March.",
        "This is 15 basis points (bp) less than the rate observed a month earlier.",
        "The drop in annual consumer inflation was due to a decline in the annual variation in food, given less of a change in prices for regulated items and those for the basket of tradable goods excluding food and regulated items.With respect to food, the variation was 4.56%, which is 14 bp below the rate posted in February.",
        "There were reductions in the annual variations in both perishables and processed foods.",
        "Conversely, the annual variation in “eating out” continued to accelerate, reaching 5.87% in March (22 bp more than in February).The non-food CPI declined from 3.10% in February to 2.95% in March, given the slowdown in price changes for the regulated and tradable baskets, and because prices in the non-tradable basket remained relatively stable.The annual variation in the regulated CPI exhibited a sizeable reduction during the past month (from 5.6% to 4.9%), mainly due to a high basis of comparison in March of last year.",
        "Within this basket, the increases in gas, fuel and urban transport service rates continued to exceed the average for the CPI.With respect to the annual change in tradables excluding food and regulated prices, the figure in March was 0.68%, or five (5) bp less than in February.",
        "This slight drop may be associated with the exchange-rate appreciation witnessed since the start of the year.At the same time, non-tradables excluding food and regulated items stayed at 3.7%.",
        "This annual rate, which has been rising slowly, reflects the positive levels estimated for the output gap.The core inflation indicators declined during the past month, although very slightly.",
        "The average of the three indicators tracked by Banco de la República was 3.23% (four (4) bp less than the month before).Along with the downturn in consumer inflation, the past month also saw a new reduction to 1.5% in the annual variation in the PPI, down from 2.6% in February.",
        "An important part of this decline may still be attributed to peso appreciation, as suggested by the even sharper drop in the imported PPI, with an annual variation of -2.1% by March.Inflation expectations at different horizons declined again in March.",
        "Those obtained from the monthly survey of market operators were 3.27% for December of this year and 3.45% by March 2013.",
        "In the case of the quarterly survey of employers, trade unions and experts, the results were 3.54% and 3.49%, respectively.",
        "The expectations derived from the TES horizons at two, three and five years converged at 3% GrowthThe figures at hand for the first quarter of 2012 suggest the momentum in private consumption may have been similar to what it was at the end of last year.",
        "On the one hand, retail sales (measured by DANE) rose during the first two months at an annual rate of 7% as opposed to an annual increase of 5% by the fourth quarter of last year, while sales excluding vehicles posted 10.7% annual growth by February.",
        "On the other hand, imports of consumer goods were up by around 23% during the first two months of the year, versus 15% in the fourth quarter.",
        "Similarly, the merchants surveyed by Fenalco indicated again, in March, a favorable perception of current circumstances with respect to their sales.",
        "Moreover, the consumer loan portfolio continued to grow at real annual rates close to 20%.",
        "The unemployment rate declined during the first three months of the year.",
        "The good performance summarized in the different indicators associated with consumption is confirmed by the continued high level of consumer confidence measured by Fedesarrollo.",
        "Although the indicator was down during February and March, the levels remain considerable from a relative standpoint.As for investment, one can expect to see a slowdown in annual growth during the first quarter of 2012, considering the fact that imports of capital goods, in dollars, declined from an average increase of 39% in the final quarter of 2011 to 16.5%, on average, between January and February of this year.",
        "By the same token, the rise in domestic production of capital goods showed no added variation with respect to what was observed at the end of last year.The value of Colombian exports came to US$4,836 million by February, with an annual increase of 22.5%, which is less than the average for the last six months (42%).",
        "The growth in exports that month was due primarily to added sales of mining commodities (33% annual).",
        "Agricultural exports were down by 23% in February 2012, given the drop in sales of coffee and flowers: 29% and 17% respectively.",
        "The annual increase in exports excluding commodities was 13%.A look at the different branches of activity shows coffee and crude oil production were affected by temporary supply shocks that will lead to lower growth rates for agriculture and mining during the first quarter of the year.",
        "Quarterly coffee production fell to its lowest level in the last 40 years, while crude oil production backtracked in quarterly terms for the first time since 2003.",
        "As for industry, the figure released by DANE with respect to the annual increase in production by February (4.5%) confirms the growth exhibited by this sector during recent quarters, with slow and less expansion than that of the economy as a whole.",
        "The satisfactory levels of Fedesarrollo indicators for orders and inventories by February suggest the trend in March and April will be similar.",
        "In short, the estimate for GDP growth by the first quarter of 2012 indicates a slowdown compared to the fourth quarter of last year, in annual terms.",
        "This is due to less momentum in investment and exports.",
        "However, the available figures for private consumption point to good performance during the early months of the year.For 2012 as a whole, the models not suggest changes in the forecasts that were on hand last quarter.",
        "This being the case, the increase in GDP for the entire year would be somewhere between 4.0% and 6.0% with 5.0% being the most likely figure Financial VariablesBy March, the annual increase in total lending (in and FC) came to 19.7%, which is 73 bp less than in February and down by 365 bp compared to the annual growth reported in July 2011.",
        "This performance was dominated by the commercial loan portfolio, with an increase of 17.5%, which is 130 bp less than the month before and adds up to a slowdown of 585 bp during the last eight months.",
        "For now, the momentum in the consumer and mortgage loan portfolios has stabilized, with annual growth rates near the averages witnessed since July 2011.In March, real interest rates (discounting the non-food CPI) on consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial loans stood at 15.9%, 10.3% and 9.0%, in that order.",
        "These rates are below their respective averages calculated since 1998 (mortgage lending is an exception; its average has been measured since 2002) The External ContextThe outlook for global growth in 2012 has improved slightly compared to what was expected at the start of the year.",
        "Among other reasons, this is due to better liquidity conditions in Europe, thanks to the actions taken by its economic authorities and the fact that the spread of contagion from the recession in that group of countries to the economies in the rest of the world has been limited.",
        "Nevertheless, the risks are still there, since the European situation has not been resolved entirely and oil prices remain high.In Europe, the figures for the first quarter of 2012 indicate the economy is still in a recession.",
        "However, the decline in productive activity has been modest and is a far cry from what was witnessed during the international financial crisis in 2008-2009, when gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 5.6%.",
        "A scenario with a moderate and short recession in Europe for 2012 would be the case, provided the action taken by European authorities manages to revive lending and demand.In the United States, the indicators of productive activity for the first quarter of 2012 show the economy has continued to grow at a moderate pace, although slightly better than expected, thanks to added momentum in consumption and industrial activity.",
        "Even so, the figures for March and April cast doubt on the strength of the recovery, since the job market still shows signs of weakness and several indexes for productive activity rose less than anticipated.",
        "Moreover, the housing market remains stagnant, and the latest figures on sales of new and used homes do not suggest a quick recovery.As for the emerging economies, China’s GDP growth slowed during the first quarter of 2012, as forecast, going from an annual rate of 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 8.1%.",
        "Nonetheless, domestic demand continues to grow.",
        "In February, industrial production and the confidence index in the manufacturing sector rose surprisingly.Asia’s other emerging market economies have experienced several surges in industrial activity and in exports associated with normalization of the supply chain in Thailand and increased purchases from China.The Latin American economies continued to grow at a pace slightly below their potential.",
        "The figures at hand for the first quarter of the year show industrial production accelerated in various countries of the region, as the confidence indexes.",
        "The rise in oil prices witnessed since the end of 2011 would be bolstering national revenue for oil-producing countries such as Ecuador and Venezuela.",
        "This, in turn, would have a positive impact on output during the first quarter.With respect to the prices of goods Colombia exports, those for oil increased again, as prices for other agricultural products.",
        "Accordingly, terms of trade are still at record highs and continue to strengthen the country’s revenue.",
        "The remainder of the year could see some decline in terms of trade, but their levels would remain considerable.The central banks in the leading developed economies have kept monetary policy loose.",
        "Current prospects and the announcements made by monetary authorities would indicate the interest rates in those countries will stay low for quite some time, as long as domestic inflation permits.",
        "With respect to the emerging market economies, most of the central banks have not changed their intervention rates.The risk premiums of the Latin American countries have remained relatively stable due to currently good conditions in the region.",
        "This has reduced exchange-rate fluctuations in these countries.In short, the forecasts for 2012 on the external front suggest slightly negative economic growth in Europe, while growth in the United States could be more than was anticipated initially, although below its potential.",
        "The emerging countries could grow at a slower pace, but one near the long-term rate.",
        "Therefore, Colombia’s trading partners likely will see less average growth this year than in 2011, and external demand will continue to be weak as a result.It is worth noting that the risk of less growth is still significant.",
        "Uncertainty returned to the world’s financial markets as of early April, due to Spain’s failure to meet its fiscal target for 2011 and doubts about its ongoing economic recovery.",
        "This is compounded by the continued standstill in lending throughout the region, despite action taken by the European Central Bank, and by the fact that the markets for the government bonds of the other peripheral European countries are weakening once again AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors was unanimously in considering it appropriate to hold the policy interest rate steady, in view of the following factors.",
        "(i) On the external front, the forecasts for 2012 suggest slightly negative economic growth in Europe, while the rate of growth in the United States could be below its potential.",
        "Growth in the emerging market economies is expected to be less, but close to the long-term rate.",
        "Consequently, Colombia’s trading partners are expected to see less average growth this year than in 2011.",
        "(ii) The international price of oil remained high, as prices for the other commodities Colombia exports.",
        "Therefore, terms of trade are at record highs and are fueling the increase in national revenue.",
        "For its part, peso appreciation may be affecting the performance of certain tradable sectors.",
        "(iii) Economic growth in Colombia during 2012 is expected to be somewhere between 4% and 6%.",
        "The momentum in private demand will continue to be the primary source of that growth, in terms of both household consumption and investment.",
        "The figures available throughout the year suggest a more moderate increase in household consumption and investment, which is consistent with the rate of growth forecast for the year as a whole.",
        "(iv) The increase in the commercial loan portfolio slowed as a result of less momentum in loans in foreign currency.",
        "Growth in lending to households remains high, especially in the case of consumer loans, indicating households have raised their level of borrowing substantially.",
        "This has occurred in a context where real interest rates on ordinary and consumer loans (except credit card lending) are below their historic averages.",
        "(v) In March, annual inflation (3.40%) slowed faster than Bank’s technical team and the market expected.",
        "The core inflation measurements continued to average around 3%.",
        "Inflation expectations declined once again and are expected to continue to converge towards the middle of the target range.",
        "(vi) There is still the risk of a severe recession in Europe with significant negative repercussions for economic activity in Colombia, but the likelihood of its occurrence seems to have declined.",
        "(vii) The risks to inflation stemming from expectations have become more moderate.",
        "Those that can stem from the performance of consumer lending remain in effect.Considering the data at hand and even the recent trend in inflation, several of the co-directors indicated mounting risks remain, posed by a larger-than-expected increase in domestic demand due to government investment, consumption and less unemployment.Others felt the neutral range of the Bank’s intervention rate has been reached already and, given the lag between changes in interest rates and their full impact on demand, they believe any remaining inflationary pressures will be controlled in the near future through the measures that have been adopted so far.Lastly, the co-directors reiterated the need to continue to keep a close watch on consumer lending.",
        "Its real annual growth rate by March was near 22%, which is almost four times real GDP growth in 2011 DECISIONBased on the foregoing assessment of these risks, the Board of Directors decided to leave Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate unchanged.",
        "New action with respect to monetary policy will be determined by the new facts and figures that emerge.The Board will continue to carefully monitor the international situation, inflation trends and forecasts, growth, and the way asset markets perform.",
        "It reiterated that monetary policy will depend on whatever new information becomes available.Bogotá,",
        "On 24th August 2012, in the city of Bogota, , the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica’s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the Governor Mr. Jose Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Juan Pablo Zarate and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth circumstances and perspectives discussed, and decisions relating with monetary policy are adopted.More information in the attached document.",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República Held on October 26, 2012 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Annual consumer inflation was 3.08% in September.",
        "This represents a slight decline compared to the month before.",
        "The change in the CPI for the year to September was 2.32%, which is significantly less compared to the same period in 2011 (2.95%).",
        "The slight downturn in total inflation was concentrated in the food CPI.",
        "The annual variation in the food CPI fell by 40 bp to 3.7% last month.",
        "A downward trend in this rate has been observed for a year, given the favorable performance of perishable food prices.",
        "As for the non-food CPI, the largest rise was in the regulated CPI (3.1%), which was up by 18 bp compared to the August rate.",
        "This performance is attributed mainly to the change in fuel prices and to the increase in electricity rates.",
        "The annual variations in the other components of this index – public utilities and urban public transportation – declined.",
        "In September, the CPI for tradables (1.09%) and non-tradables (4.02%) also showed larger annual variations.",
        "In the first case, the 12 bp rise compared to the month before was largely due to higher air fares and car prices.",
        "As for non-tradables, the build-up of 8 bp with respect to the annual variation the month before was concentrated in rentals, at 3.9%, which is the highest rate since late 2010.",
        "The average of the four indicators tracked by Banco de la República came to 3.16% last month, as opposed to 3.12% in August.",
        "The annual variation in the overall PPI at September was 0.13%, which is similar to the rate in August.",
        "The imported PPI stayed in negative terrain, partly because of stability in the exchange rate, while the PPI for goods produced and consumed in the country is positive, but very low.",
        "The past month saw no major changes in the various measurements of inflation expectations.",
        "According to the monthly survey of market operators, inflation is expected to be de 3.1% at the end of this year and 3.2% by September 2013.",
        "On the other hand, the quarterly business survey conducted at the start of October shows 3.4% expected inflation for December and at twelve months.",
        "Finally, the measurements derived from TES at two, three and five years converged at 3% Growth The indicators of supply and demand for the third quarter reflect mixed signals.",
        "However, the most relevant data suggest economic activity slowed during that period compared to the first half of the year.",
        "On the demand side, the indicators for retail sales, automobile sales and confidence levels are evidence that household consumption is less dynamic.",
        "According to DANE, retail sales in August grew at an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 1.4% in July and 4.0% in June.",
        "Part of this slowdown was explained by the drop in sales of cars and motorcycles (-3.7% annual).",
        "In fact, retail sales excluding cars and fuel were up by an annual rate of 2.5%.",
        "Consumer confidence levels during the third quarter were less than in the second.",
        "The recovery in the consumer confidence index in September not offset the declines registered during the two previous months.",
        "With this recent development, the downward trend observed in the indicator since early 2012 continues.",
        "However, other variables suggest the slowdown in overall household spending might not be so pronounced.",
        "On the one hand, imports in dollars during July and August for the consumer sector posted respective annual increases of 12.9% and 11.9%.",
        "Furthermore, family income has not been affected, judging by the good performance of employment, especially salaried jobs, which rose at an annual rate of 6.8%, and by an inflation rate near the middle of the target range.",
        "Consumer lending has slowed, but continues to grow at high rates, together with real interest rates that are at the average calculated since 2000.",
        "As for investment, the figures on hand indicate the momentum observed during the second quarter could hold.",
        "Imports of capital goods for industry accelerated in the July-August average compared to the average on record for April-June.",
        "However, imports of capital goods for agriculture and imports of transport equipment saw declines in July and August.",
        "Total exports in dollars were down in August at an annual rate of 9% (not including re-exports of aircraft; when these are included, the annual variation is -7.6%).",
        "This was mainly because mining exports dropped by 14.6%, since agricultural and industrial and “other” exports registered annual increase of 2.7% and 5.8%, in that order.",
        "In the case of mining products, the items that declined were petroleum and derivatives (-2.9% annual) and coal (- 55% annual).",
        "The increase in exports of agricultural products is explained by the rise coffee export values (15% annual), since exports of bananas and flowers fell at respective annual rates of 14% and 3%.",
        "On the supply side, the indicators available for industry continue to reflect weak performance.",
        "The annual variation in the IPI, without coffee processing, was -1.9% for the month of August.",
        "Part of this performance is explained by less external demand due to the weak global economy.",
        "In Colombia, as in other countries, the reduced growth in exports and industrial production mirrors the lack of strength in the global economy.",
        "Moreover, according to Fedesarrollo, industrial confidence continued to deteriorate in August.",
        "Something similar happened with production expectations three months out.",
        "The industrial inventory indicator (which is counter-cyclical) showed an upward trend, but is still at a low level.",
        "The volume of industrial orders continued to decline.",
        "All of this suggests low growth in this sector during the next few months.",
        "Even so, industrial demand for deregulated energy, which is highly correlated with the IPI, rose in September at an annual rate of 3.4% (2.4% in August), so industrial production could have accelerated that month.",
        "In the case of commerce, according to the Fedesarrollo survey for August, merchants saw their economic situation improve slightly, while expectations at six months remained stable.",
        "Even so, the trend continues to suggest growth in the sector will slow during the coming months.",
        "A similar conclusion can be drawn from the Fenalco survey.",
        "Some of the figures associated with the agriculture and mining sectors have improved in recent months.",
        "Coffee production between July and September is a case in point.",
        "According to the Federation of Coffee Growers, it experienced an annual increase of 20%.",
        "The Ministry of Mines and Energy reports oil production in September amounted to 956 thousand barrels a day, which is more than in the previous three months (927 MBD).",
        "Despite the signs of deceleration, growth during the coming quarters will continue to be propelled by internal demand.",
        "A healthy financial system, household confidence and a dynamic job market will continue to support the increase in consumption.",
        "At the same time, commodity prices, confidence levels, the availability of internal and external financing, and foreign direct investment will contribute to investment growth.",
        "Consequently, the forecast range for economic growth in 2012 as a whole is between 3.7% and 4.9% Financial Variables Bank lending (in and FC) posted 16.1% annual growth in September, down from the month before (16.4%) and compared to June of this year (17.5%).",
        "The commercial and household loan portfolios continued to slow during the third quarter.",
        "The annual increase in commercial loans in domestic currency went from 16.6% to 14.4% between June 29 and October 5, while commercial lending in foreign currency rebounded slightly, although a consolidated trend has yet to be observed.",
        "For its part, the annual growth in consumer lending during the quarter went from 21.2% to 19.1%, while the annual increase in mortgage lending declined from 16.0% to 15.4% during the same period.",
        "In September, the real interest rates (discounting the non-food CPI) on consumer, mortgage, ordinary commercial and preferential lending were 15.7%, 10.0%, 8.8% and 5.8%, in that order.",
        "These rates are below the respective averages calculated since 2000 The External Context The latest figures show Europe continues to contract and the United States is experiencing moderate growth.",
        "In the emerging markets, the highlights are the slowdown in China and other Southeast Asian economies, because their exports and industrial production have weakened.",
        "In Latin America, with the exception of Brazil, the pace of growth in the larger economies has remained at a good level, thanks to the buoyancy in internal demand.",
        "In the euro zone, industrial production and retail sales continue to decline in annual terms.",
        "Similarly, the deterioration in consumer and industrial confidence indexes persists, while the unemployment rate is high and shows no signs of getting better.",
        "Nevertheless, conditions on the financial markets and with respect to government debt have improved compared to the previous quarter, thanks partly to the announcements by the European Central Bank on unlimited purchases of sovereign bonds (OMT).",
        "This plan was well-received by the markets, boosting agents’ confidence.",
        "In the case of the United States, economic growth continues at a moderate pace and was 2% in the third quarter, despite less external demand.",
        "Some housing and job market indicators have improved.",
        "Industry has slowed, but indicators of sentiment have begun to recover.",
        "As for demand, household consumption continues to increase and confidence has recovered.",
        "The moderation in export growth persists, given added external weakness.",
        "In a context of low inflationary pressures, weak demand and the perception of risk in view of the European situation, monetary authorities in the United States announced they would keep interest rates low until at least 2015.",
        "The greatest risk to the US economy in the near future is on the fiscal front.",
        "In China, as in other Asian countries, one sees a similar pattern of slowing growth in exports, industrial activity and retail sales, which gradually is beginning to be mirrored in a slower rate of economic activity.",
        "In the case of China, the reduction in growth was accentuated by monetary policy measures intended to lessen internal demand as a way to prevent inflationary pressures.",
        "In Latin America, although export growth has slowed significantly in countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador, the pace of its expansion remains favorable.",
        "The decline in external activity has been offset by the force of domestic demand, which has allowed output in several cases to grow to a level near its potential.",
        "Despite the slowdown in the global economy, international oil prices remain high due to added geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Africa.",
        "Food prices have declined in recent weeks, as the weather at -year returned to normal.",
        "In this context, global inflation is still within tolerable ranges.",
        "This fact, coupled with weak economic growth, has allowed central banks, especially those in the developed economies, to maintain a highly expansive monetary policy.",
        "International financial conditions have improved in recent weeks, partly because of the policy actions of the world’s major central banks.",
        "Volatility is down and the prices of some assets have increase.",
        "Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of uncertainty associated with the problems facing public finances and private banks in some of the advanced economies.",
        "Consequently, the downside risks to global growth continue AND The Board of Directors considered the following factors in its deliberations.",
        "(i) The indicators of economic activity in the third quarter of 2012 confirm the weakness of the global economy.",
        "Europe continues to contract and the United State is growing at a moderate pace.",
        "The slowdown observed in some of the larger emerging market economies appears to be stabilizing.",
        "In this context and without inflationary pressures, one can expect the external interest rate to remain low for a prolonged period of time.",
        "Moreover, despite less global growth, international prices for oil and other commodities remain high.",
        "(ii) International financial conditions have improved, partly because of the policy actions of the world's major central banks.",
        "Volatility has declined and the prices of some assets have increased.",
        "Even so, there is still a great deal of uncertainty associated with the problems facing public finances and banks in some of the advanced economies.",
        "(iii) In Colombia, as in other countries, less growth in exports and industrial production is a reflection of the weakness of the global economy.",
        "Terms of trade remain high and are stimulating national revenue.",
        "(iv) Despite the signs of deceleration, growth during the coming quarters will continue to be driven by internal demand.",
        "A healthy financial system, household confidence and a dynamic job market will continue to support the rise in consumption.",
        "For their part, commodity prices, confidence levels, the availability of internal and external financing, and foreign direct investment will contribute to investment growth.",
        "(v) Growth in lending continues to slow, and the new and used housing price indexes are at historically high levels.",
        "(vi) Inflation, the average of the core inflation indicators and inflation expectations are very close to the middle of the target range (3%).",
        "(vii) A deep recession in Europe is still the greatest risk to the country’s economic activity.",
        "The likelihood of its occurrence appears to have declined, thanks to the actions of the European authorities and the reaction of the markets on that continent.",
        "Some Board members suggested keeping the benchmark interest rate unchanged, arguing the slowdown in economic activity reflected in the figures began at a point where aggregate expenditure had surpassed the economy’s productive capacity.",
        "GDP growth in 2012 will be satisfactory, considering the international situation and the fact that GDP is near its potential level.",
        "Measurements of core inflation and inflation expectations are near the long- term target (3%).",
        "They also felt the vigor of domestic demand, stimulated by investment in construction and works and by terms of trade, among other factors, will continue to fuel national revenue and employment.",
        "Housing prices continue to increase at high rates and lending has slowed, but is still growing at a fair pace.",
        "These variables also must be considered when defining the country’s monetary stance, so as to minimize the risks of future imbalances in them.",
        "Other members believe there is room to lower the intervention interest rate, since a good monetary policy rests on the ability to anticipate and because inflation and inflation expectations continue to converge toward the midpoint of the long-term target range.",
        "The foregoing is in a context of weak global economic activity due to a stronger and more prolonged recession in Europe and slow economic growth in the United States and several emerging countries, which makes the Colombian economy vulnerable, given the make- up of its export sectors.",
        "Moreover, indicators of internal demand, consumption, consumer confidence, lending and industry signal the economy has been slowing According to its assessment of the current risk balance, the Board of Director of Banco de la República, by a majority, considered it appropriate to hold the intervention interest rate at 4.75%.",
        "Future monetary policy action will be determined by new information concerning the course of events in the developed countries and their impact on confidence, global demand and international commodity prices, and also by information on the situation within Colombia.",
        "The Board of Directors reiterated that Banco de la República has enough tools and resources to meet the economy’s regular liquidity the needs in domestic and foreign currency and those that might arise in an environment of international financial turbulence.",
        "The Board of Directors will continue to keep a close eye on performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in Colombia, in asset markets and with respect to the international situation.",
        "Finally, it repeated that monetary policy will hinge on whatever new information becomes available.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Directors’ Meeting of 30th January 2012 On 30[th] January 2012, in the city of Bogota, the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica’s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the Governor and Managing Director Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, as well as the perspectives for both situations are discussed, and decisions relating with the monetary policy are adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the major subjects addressed at this meeting Annual consumer inflation in December was 3.73% (0.42% monthly), which means 23 basic points (bp) less than in November.",
        "This value exceeded 3%, the central point of the long-term target range defined by the Bank’s Board of Directors (3%+/-1 percentage point).",
        "In addition, it was above the expectations, and increased 46 bp with respect to the figure recorded a year before.",
        "The fall of inflation during the month is mainly explained by deceleration in the variation in food prices.",
        "On its side, the GDP without foods stood at 3.13%, which means 10 bp more than in November and 31 bp above December’s GDP in the previous year.",
        "This was the result of a rise in tradable and non-tradable basket prices after the exclusion of foods and regulated items.",
        "With respect to the food CPI, annual variation shifted from 6.4% in November to 5.3% in December.",
        "Just like in the previous month, what contributed the most to this drop was price variation in perishable foods, with potatoes and fruits exhibiting absolute price falls.",
        "This behavior suggests that non-processed food supply conditions have continued to return to normal after the shocks suffered from the bad weather conditions.",
        "Since the processed food GDP was slightly diminished, peso depreciation over the previous months and international prices would not have generated significant upward pressures.",
        "The variation in prices of eating away from home remained stable, but nonetheless above the target range ceiling; this might be due to the dynamism of internal demand.",
        "Within the GDP without foods, the increase in the annual variation in the tradable-item GDP (without regulated items) to 0.80% in December stands out.",
        "Since September 2011, this indicator has been going up; this fact is likely to be associated to the exchange rate depreciation between September and December and the internal demand boom as well.",
        "Likewise, in December, increases were seen in the annual variation in non-tradable without foods and regulated items.",
        "This indicator has increased in the past six months; this might be the result of the dynamism of internal demand and the broadening of the product gap.",
        "Particularly, most increases are concentrated on health-service items and leases.",
        "The variation in the regulated items GDP remained at 5.8%.",
        "However, the record continues to be high as propelled by the price of gasoline and public transportation.",
        "Base inflation continued to go up in December for the forth consecutive month.",
        "The average of the three indicators monitored by Banco de la Republica stood at 3.41%, 7 bp more than in the previous month.",
        "Inflation expectations grew in early January 2012, upon the announcement of December data; those obtained from the 12-month monthly survey stand at 3.56% as compared with 4.44% of the past month.",
        "In the same survey, inflation is expected to be 3.55% in December 2012.",
        "Measurements deriving from different-term public debt certificates “TES” also increase.",
        "With respect to salaries, no significant pressures had been generated at year end on consumer prices, since adjustment reports stand around 4% for both industry and commerce, and construction.",
        "All the above suggests that production costs would not have been a source of significant pressures on consumer prices in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "Nevertheless, this situation is unlikely to remain unchanged for 2012 due to the narrowness of the labor market, and the fact that the minimum wage 5.8% adjustment was higher by 2.8 percentage points than the 3% long-term target Growth According to the, the National Administrative Department of Statistics DANE, the Colombian GDP grew 7.7% in annual terms in the third quarter of 2011 (1.7% on a quarterly basis).",
        "This expansion rate, together with that registered in the forth quarter of 2006, is the highest seen since 1979.",
        "Unlike the previous quarters, the largest contribution to growth by type of expenditure came from investment in fixed capital or “FBKF” (gross fixed capital formation), where the investment contribution destined for industry was important.",
        "The annual increase of the “FBKF” was 20%, and it displaced household consumption as the main engine of growth.",
        "However, household performance was significant too (7.3%).",
        "A deceleration from 24.9% in June down to 18.8% was experienced in the third quarter.",
        "Despite this lower rhythm, the real import level is historically high.",
        "Exports rebounded and were able to record, again, a two- digit growth rate (10.5%).",
        "On the supply side, the sectors with higher growth rates were mining (18.4%) and construction (18.1%).",
        "Financial services expanded by 6.6%, but contributed in a significant way to GDP dynamics given their importance in the total.",
        "In the third quarter, positive annual growth rates were registered by all sectors.",
        "For the fourth quarter, the most recent information suggests that Colombian economy continued to show good dynamism by growing at a rate even higher than the one registered in the first quarter of the year.",
        "By type of expenditure, growth continues to be propelled by household consumption; this can be inferred from the dynamic behavior of commerce sales (annual variation of 3.7% on average as of November) and imports of consumer goods in dollars in October and November (annual 17% on average), as well as from portfolio and interest rate data addressed to this item (in the fourth quarter, the annual growth in the consumer credit balance was nearly 22%).",
        "In addition, it can be anticipated that private consumption in the fourth quarter may have been favored by the continuous fall registered in the unemployment rate.",
        "This reduction was fundamentally due to the increase experienced in labor demand and the dynamic increment of the number of occupied individuals at both the national level and the 13 metropolitan areas.",
        "In the fourth quarter, one-single-digit unemployment rates were seen, similar and even lower than those observed in 2007.",
        "The conjunction of the above-mentioned factors along with improved expectations favored a recovery in consumer confidence at the end of 2011.",
        "According to Fedesarrollo, consumer confidence grew significantly in December and stood not only above the series average, but also at the highest level for the whole year.",
        "With respect to investment, and despite having less information, the scenario might have been favorable as well.",
        "In the first place, imports of capital goods in dollars grew 40.5% on average in October and November and, secondly, because cement production in November maintained a dynamic behavior with annual growths higher than 10%.",
        "On the supply side, the behavior of industrial production stood out.",
        "In November, the GDP grew at a 6.5% annual rate.",
        "Information available with respect to orders and stocks suggests that the sector might grow in December at rates similar to those observed in the past three months (5.5%).",
        "Colombia’s external sales kept on growing.",
        "In November, total exports in dollars grew 42.5% per year, this fact mainly explained by an increase of 52.1% in the foreign sales of the main products of mining origin (oil, coal, gold, ferronickel).",
        "Likewise, industrial exports increased 31.5% and 31.5% those of agricultural origin.",
        "By destinations, industrial exports grew 69.1% to Venezuela, 28.1% to Ecuador, and 26.9% to the rest of the countries.",
        "Generally, in 2011, significant household consumption growth would have been possible (by duplicating its growth average in the past decade), and a strong acceleration in investment growth.",
        "In the external sector, exports in real terms would have registered the highest expansion rate in twenty years (close to 11%).",
        "Also imports would have exhibited a high growth rate (22.1%) and offset foreign sale dynamics.",
        "In this case, the external demand contribution to GDP growth would be negative.",
        "The best behaved sectors in 2011 would have been mining, transport, and commerce/trade.",
        "The above information may indicate that growth for 2011 might be higher than 5.5%.",
        "For 2012, information available suggests an interval for the product’s growth rate between 4.0% and 6.0% Financial variables Total credit in national currency [“moneda nacional”] (MN) and foreign currency [“moneda extranjera”] (“ME”) is kept at high growth rates with a slight moderation in December.",
        "All credit modalities for both households and enterprises continue to exhibit much higher growths than those of the economic activity.",
        "This has occurred in a context of historically low real interest rates.",
        "As of December, total credit growth (MN and ME) registered an annual rate of 21.1%, lower by 22 bp than the rate observed in November with a moderation in all of its modalities.",
        "Growth rates were: 25.0% for consumer credit, 19.5% for commercial credit, and 17.2% for mortgage credit.",
        "In December, real interest rates (excluding CPI without foods) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial credits stood at 15.4%, 9.6% and 8.2%, respectively, this figures being lower than the averages observed since 1998 (with the exception of the mortgage credit rate, the average of which is being estimated since May 2002) External context For the last 2011 quarter, the world’s economic activity figures show that global economy has been weakening as a result of the Eurozone recession symptoms having forced a downward revision of world growth for the full year 2012.",
        "In the Eurozone, private bank public debt and funding solvency problems have affected the economic activity and greatly deteriorated entrepreneur and consumer confidence in the region.",
        "Added to the threatening contagion of the sovereign debt crises of Greece and Ireland to countries like Spain and Italy, there is the not yet dissipated risk of Greece not paying its debt.",
        "Should no agreement be reached in the negotiations among the financial sector, the European authorities and Greece, the likelihood of a financial crisis is high, given the significant exposure of some European banks to the Greek debt.",
        "Despite the measures adopted by the Central European Bank to avoid credit restriction, no revitalization signs are visible in the granting of credit by the private banking.",
        "The European authorities have continued to advance in matters such as public spending reduction, fiscal integration, and the reinvigoration of the financial system to confront the crisis.",
        "Notwithstanding, the measures adopted seem to be insufficient to solve the region’s unbalances in terms of economic growth and competitiveness.",
        "All this has been reflecting in the volatile behavior of financial markets, while there is an increasing likelihood of an economic recession in the Eurozone that might have begun in the last quarter of 2011 and would extend over the first semester of 2012.",
        "In the United States, a likely contagion of the external situation seem to be limited, and the economy continues to exhibit positive dynamism as supported on a recovery of both consumption and the manufacturing activity.",
        "Last unemployment figures were better than those estimated by the market average, and the industry continued to show rehabilitation signs.",
        "With inflation at low levels, housing and labor markets continue to be the FED’s worst concerns; at its meeting of last Wednesday 25[th] January, it announced that it would keep its intervention interest rates near zero until 2014.",
        "According to the analysts, this announcement is expected to maintain long- term rates at low levels to reduce the cost of mortgage debt.",
        "Despite the recent positive data, the United States growth is likely to be moderate in the next quarters as a consequence of the still prevailing structural difficulties.",
        "In Japan, the supply chain seems to show a high recovery percentage after the 2011 natural disaster.",
        "However, the economy has started to evidence weakening symptoms particularly in its exports, as a result of reduction in global demand.",
        "The major emerging economies have continued to decelerate in line with the previous report’s forecasts.",
        "In China, the most recent economic growth and industrial activity figures suggest a slight decrease in growth, while the weakening of the housing market implies an additional risk to the fall in global demand.",
        "Last announcements from the Chinese authorities suggest higher fiscal and monetary encouragements in the months to come.",
        "For the Latin American economies, the trend is growth moderation.",
        "In the case of Brazil, for example, fiscal and monetary stimulus measures are being introduced in order to mitigate external shocks.",
        "Both lower global economic growth and low inflationary pressures would give way to a looser or more comfortable monetary policy worldwide.",
        "For this reason, no interest rate increases are expected in advanced economies.",
        "On the contrary, the monetary policy will continue to be expansive, and additional rounds of liquidity injections in Europe are not been ruled out.",
        "On the other hand, in most emerging economies, interest rate stability or reductions are expected.",
        "The international prices of basic goods have decreased from its maximums attained in the first semester of 2011, but they still remain at historically high levels.",
        "For 2012, international quotations of the main basic goods exported by Colombia are expected to keep relatively high levels despite the predictable lower growth in global demand.",
        "In the case of oil, projections have increased compared to three months ago due to diverse geopolitical tensions.",
        "Therefore, the level of the terms of trade would remain high and continue to propel national income.",
        "The last balance of exchange data for Colombia reflects the fact that foreign direct investment is still dynamic, particularly as directed towards mining.",
        "If the international situation does not deteriorate further, it can be predicted that this behavior may remain unchanged in the course of 2012.",
        "To this date, the increment in risk premiums and the reduction in some European ratings have not had a significant effect on the Colombian risk premiums.",
        "In fact, in the year-to-date, the exchange rate has been appreciated after having recorded an upward trend by the end of 2011.",
        "Despite the external overview deterioration, the good results of internal growth, external sales, foreign investment and consumer and investor confidence show that no contagion of the international situation is observed in the Colombian economy AND The Board of Directors has unanimously expressed the convenience of increasing the intervention interest rates.",
        "The Board has considered that, on the external front, the following must be taken into account: (i) In Europe, the public debt crises of some countries in the region and doubts arising on the solvency of certain banks continue to affect household and entrepreneur confidence.",
        "Recession in Europe is likely to be worse than anticipated months ago.",
        "(ii) The United States economy in 2012 is expected to grow at a positive - but slightly below its potential - rate.",
        "(iii) The international prices of basic products remain at high levels and encourage the national income of the producing countries.",
        "(iv) The worst risk of core growth forecasts continues to be a disorderly adjustment in Europe.",
        "Should this risk materialize, world economy would grow considerably less than expected, the international prices of basic goods may fall, and global risk aversion may be exacerbated, all of which would have adverse effects on the Colombian economy.",
        "In the internal context, the following has to be taken into account: (i) In Colombia, as of the third quarter of 2011, the annual growth of the GDP was 7.7%, thus a historically high and above than expected figure.",
        "The annual growth of domestic demand (9.4%) was explained by the sharp increase of both investment and household consumption.",
        "(ii) Most recent information suggests that Colombian economy continued to show strong dynamism in the fourth quarter.",
        "In the external balance, both exports and imports kept on growing at high rates in November.",
        "Based on all the above, the technical team has estimated for 2011 an economic growth higher than 55.5%.",
        "For 2012, the forecast interval remained between 4% and 6%.",
        "(iii) Bank credit continued to increase at high rates.",
        "The consumption credit behavior suggests that households are increasing their degree of indebtedness in a significant manner.",
        "(iv) The average of base inflation measures went up again, and most of them exceed 3%.",
        "(v) Consumer confidence remains at high levels.",
        "(iv) Employment predictions foresee increasing pressures at the labor market for 2012.",
        "(vii) The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and growth projections.",
        "(viii) The different interest rate levels, except those for credit cards, stand at values below the past 15 years’ averages.",
        "(ix) The main risk on inflation comes from excessive expansions in demand or increases in costs above those expected, with hard and lasting effects on monetary policy expectations and credibility.",
        "In longer time horizon, excessive credit growth and the persistence of low real interest rates might become a source of financial unbalances with negative effects on the sustainability of economic growth.",
        "A Board Member deemed appropriate to supplement the rate increase with some king of macro-prudential measure aimed at accelerating the interest rate transmission on consumer credit dynamics.",
        "According to the assessment of the current balance of these risks which lend more weight to the internal conditions of the economy, the Board of Directors has decided to increase Banco de la Republica intervention interest rate by 25 basic points.",
        "The Board will continue to carefully monitor the international situation, inflation behavior and projections, and growth, as well as the active markets performance; and it restates that monetary policy will depend upon the new information available.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Director’s Meeting of 28th September 2012 On 28[th] September, in the city of Bogota, , the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica’s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Mauricio Cardenas-Santamaria, the Governor Mr. Jose Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Fernando Tenjo, Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth situations and their perspectives are discussed, and decisions relating with monetary policy are adopted Annual consumer inflation increased 8 bp in August with respect to July, and stood at 3.11%.",
        "For year-to-date through August, the CPI adjustment has been 2.03%, significantly lower than that registered in the period of 2011 (2.64%).",
        "The increase in total inflation in August was concentrated in the groups of foods, non-tradable without foods, and regulated items.",
        "With respect to the CPI without foods, its annual variation remained virtually stable at 2.75% resulting from a rise in the non-tradable component and a fall in tradable and regulated items.",
        "The increase in the annual variation of non-tradables (shifting from 3.7% in July to 3.9% in August) was explained above all by the behavior of the fun and enjoyment subgroup (soccer tickets).",
        "August data is the highest since July of the previous year, and it may establish a new level for this indicator in the months to come.",
        "However, this behavior could be due to a low comparison base rather than an increase in demand pressures.",
        "With regard to non-tradables, the situation dealing with the annual variation of leases is worth stressing, since it remained at 3.7% just like in the p, y g p g since 2011.",
        "With respect to other sub-baskets, the annual variation in tradables without foods and regulated items has remained close to 1.0% since May, coinciding with slight annual exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Regulated items, on their side, exhibited a decline from 3.5% in July to 3.1% in August in their annual variation, mainly due to a reduction down to 1.1% in the annual variation of fuels relating to the lower oil prices observed in the first half of the year.",
        "As for the foods CPI, annual variation showed a slight recovery (up to 4.0%), in this way interrupting the downward trend shown since April.",
        "This was basically due to the price rises in the perishable foods group, although, in this case, the annual variation remained in negative terrain.",
        "It is worth stressing that commodity prices have not increased much, which suggests that the international price rises in previous months have not yet been transmitted to consumer inflation.",
        "Core inflation also increase in the last month.",
        "According to the four core inflation indicators monitored by Banco de la Republica, it reached 3.12% in August as compared with 3.04% in the previous month.",
        "This average has been fluctuating between 3.00% and 3.15% since November last year.",
        "Regarding costs, the PPI kept a very low - though upward - annual variation (0.13%) after two months of negative records.",
        "Increases were concentrated in the produced and consumed PPI, particularly in mining, due to the rises registered in the prices of refined oil products.",
        "In this last month, a slight recovery was seen in inflation expectations after several months of falls.",
        "According to the monthly survey of financial market operators, inflation expected for December this year is 2.99% (against 2.93% in the previous month); this increase was particularly due to food inflation.",
        "On the other hand, expectations deriving from the Colombian Treasury Bonds – TES increased about 25 bp at all horizons.",
        "With the exception of the ten-year expectations, the other ones remained below 3.0%, though converging towards this value Growth According to the GDP record for the second quarter of 2012 published by the National Administrative Department of Statistics - DANE, Colombian y g p, j g of the forecast range (between 3.3% and 4.8%) submitted by the SGEE (Banco de la Republica’s Economic Studies Division) in the June Inflation Report.",
        "This result meant a quarterly acceleration of 1.6% (quarterly annualized 6.7%), the highest in the past four quarters and higher than in the first quarter of the year s (0.2%).",
        "The behavior of the economy in the period was due to the domestic demand dynamism which highly offset the external demand deterioration.",
        "Indeed, domestic demand in the second quarter recorded an annual growth rate higher than in the preceding quarter (6.9% vs0%).",
        "In contrast, the annual growth rate of exports was only 2%, this being significantly lower than the 6.6% record observed in the first quarter and the 11.4% average rate of growth for 2011.",
        "On their side, imports grew at an annual rate of 9.5%, also lower than that registered in the first three months of the year and the average for 2011 (12.4%, and 21.5% respectively).",
        "Overall, net exports contributed negatively (-2.2%) to GDP growth.",
        "Domestic demand acceleration was mainly explained by the dynamics of investments in construction and buildings, and works.",
        "Among the latter, growth rates registered for those destined for mining and the construction of railroads and runways stood out.",
        "Other investment components such as transportation equipment, and machinery and equipment, continued to exhibit important annual growth rates.",
        "Government consumption also contribute to domestic demand dynamism.",
        "This item showed higher annual variations than those expected and those registered in the first quarter of the year (4.6%, against 3.1%).",
        "Its growth was the highest observed since the middle of 2010.",
        "In contrast, household consumption continued to slow down.",
        "Its annual variation was 4.0% (equal to its average since 2000) while in the first quarter it has been 5.7%.",
        "Likewise, at a disaggregated level, lower growth rates were registered in all of its components where those in the consumption of durable of non-durable goods stood out.",
        "By activity branches, sectors showing the highest growth rates during the second quarter of 2012 were construction (18.4%) in both buildings and works, mining (8.5%), and financial services (5.1%).",
        "The only sector having recorded an annual fall was industry (-0.6%).",
        "q, gg g activity.",
        "Particularly, in the case of household consumption, an annual growth lower than that observed in the first part of the year (5.0%) might have taken place.",
        "Indeed, in July, commercial retail sales reported by the DANE showed an annual variation of 1.3%, lower than the 4.0% registered in June.",
        "Along this line, the most recent data concerning vehicle sales would indicate that also consumption of durable goods in the third quarter might have grown less than as observed in the first half of the year.",
        "According to information published by ‘Econometria’ in August, vehicle purchases exhibited negative annual variations around 10%.",
        "In addition, a fall in the Fedesarrollo consumer confidence indicator for August was noticed, although its level still remains above the historical average.",
        "Despite the above, the labor market indicators, which are an important variable in predicting consumption behavior, do not show clear deterioration in the past few months.",
        "Therefore, the number of salaried and total occupied persons, with figures as of July, continued to grow at rates close to 4.5%.",
        "For this reason, the unemployment rate has continued to fall nationwide in annual terms.",
        "For the thirteen major metropolitan areas, the rate has shown a slight increase, the first in two years, accompanied by a significant augmentation of job offers.",
        "On the supply side, the few indicators available for the third quarter of 2012 suggest a weak growth of industry and commerce.",
        "In the first case, production increased 1.5% in July, and the Fedesarrollo orders, stocks and entrepreneur indicators maintained a slow deterioration pace, though they remain at relatively good levels.",
        "On the other hand, demand for industrial electric power slowed down in August from 5.8% to 2.4%, this being a variable sharply correlated with the IPI.",
        "Nevertheless, it has to be noted that the regulated energy demand grew 4.7%.",
        "In the case of commerce, the merchants consulted by Fenalco in July pointed to a fall in their sales perception as well as deterioration in their 6- month perspectives.",
        "Something similar was yielded by the Fedesarrollo survey which, for the same month, also register a drop in the perception of the current and future situation of the entrepreneurs’ business in the sector.",
        "On the other hand, total Colombian exports in dollars fell 4% in July on an annual basis, and reached an amount of US$4.694 billion.",
        "This was fundamentally due to the 9.4% fall in mining exports, since, in contrast, agricultural and industrial and other foreign sales grew 30.6% and 5% respectively.",
        "In the case of goods of mining origin, the only item having y p ( p ) p for increased exports of agricultural products lies in the augmented exported values of banana (104%) and flowers (58%) serving to offset the 1.4% reduction in coffee exports Financial Variables In August, total credit in national and foreign currencies (“MN” and “ME” credits) exhibited an annual growth rate of 16.35%, therefore lower by 83 bp and 334 bp than the levels respectively observed in the previous month and in March.",
        "The monthly slowdown was led by the commercial portfolio, the annual increase of which declined 132 bp by shifting from 15.56% to 14.24% between July and August.",
        "On its side, the household portfolio remained close to that observed in the previous month (it shifted from 19.54% to 19.45%), because the August increases registered by the consumption and mortgage portfolios (20.76%) and (15.91%) respectively, in that order declined only 11 bp and 5 bp as compared with July.",
        "With respect to March, moderation shown in the commercial and the household portfolios has been similar, with reductions of 322 bp and 364 bp, respectively, in their growth rate.",
        "In August, real interest rates (excluding the CPI without foods) for consumption, mortgage and ordinary commercial credits, in that order, stood at 16.3%, 10.2% and 9.4%, these being rates below their respective averages calculated since 2000 (excluding the mortgage rate, the average of which is measured from May 2002).",
        "On the other hand, real interest rates for credits granted with credit cards, and for the preference and treasury modalities, stood at 26.9%, 6.2% and 5.8%, which are higher than their averages calculated since 2000 External Context The recent decisions of the central banks in the major developed economies around a widening of the lax monetary policy that they have been maintaining during the past few years let think that the policy interest rates of the advanced countries should remain at levels close to zero beyond 2014, and global liquidity is bound to increase in the next few months.",
        "Therefore, in the Eurozone, the European Central Bank (BCE) announced the unlimited purchase of government debt bonds to those countries asking for aid and g j p, United States (FED) implemented a third round quantitative ease (QE3), this time conditional on the evolution of the labor market.",
        "At the same time, the central bank of Japan extended its expansionist policy.",
        "The above might increase capital flows to the emerging economies, thus generating currency appreciation pressures.",
        "The measures adopted by the European Central Bank (BCE) would allow time for the other authorities in the region to progress in economic integration and reactivate their economic growth.",
        "In this sense, the German Constitutional Court ratified in the past month the legality of the European stabilization mechanism expected to start working in the next few months.",
        "Likewise, the European authorities have maintained their dialogues regarding the creation of a centralized banking supervision agency; nevertheless, their steps in these directions are still slow.",
        "Global economic activity has continued to slowdown in the past few months, especially in the economies of the Eurozone and those more exposed to it.",
        "In great part this fact is explained by the lessened dynamism affecting industry and foreign trade.",
        "With figures as of July, some real activity indicators in the Eurozone (industrial production, consumer credit, and retail sales) continued to contract in annual terms.",
        "On the other hand, the entrepreneur and consumer sentiment indices remained depressed in August, and this may imply further deterioration of the real activity in the months to come.",
        "To the extent that policies adopted by the European authorities begin to bring good effects on confidence in the region, it would be possible to observe their positive influence on growth.",
        "However, it can be predicted that the response of the economic activity will hardly materialize in the remainder of the year.",
        "Industrial production in the United States showed a sharp contraction in August and slowed down as seen in the annual comparison; this situation might be repeated in the next months as anticipated by the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Likewise, the last exports and labor market figures have evidenced that the stagnation seen in these indicators would have continued to be observed in the third quarter.",
        "Despite the above, the service sector, and real retail sales, as well as the real estate sector, they went on expanding according to the last figures available.",
        "In this , p p p moderate rhythm during the third quarter.",
        "With respect to the emerging countries, real activity has continued to decelerate in the main Asian economies, particularly in China and India.",
        "In the first case, this slowdown appears to be higher than expected by the Chinese authorities and they have been compelled to implement additional policies in order to encourage domestic demand.",
        "In Latin America, real activity in the second quarter continued to expand at a favorable pace in Mexico, Chile and Peru, as supported by the dynamism of domestic – and mostly public – demand.",
        "In Brazil, the most recent information available shows signs of a better performance probably relating to the stimuli implemented in previous months by the Brazilian economic authorities.",
        "The international oil prices have declined in the past few weeks.",
        "Apparently, some OPEC countries are willing to increase their production in order to ensure lower prices below those prevailing in the past three months, and also more consistent with the current economic situation.",
        "Nevertheless, despite these falls, the average price of oil is still relatively high.",
        "With relation to food prices, some cereals have interrupted the rises occurring in the middle of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, they still remain at high levels likely to generate inflationary - though in any case temporary - pressures in some emerging economies AND For the purposes of their discussion, the Board of Directors took into account the following elements: (i) Economic activity indicators published last month confirm a slight weakening in world economy.",
        "In Europe, economic conditions continued to slow down and, likely, the region’s GDP would fell in the third quarter.",
        "Growth in the United States is keeping a moderate pace while economy in Japan is also failing.",
        "In this context, and with no inflationary pressures, the central Banks in Europe, the United States and Japan have announced further monetary stimuli for a more prolonged period.",
        "A common factor in a significant number of emerging countries has been deceleration in both exports and industrial production.",
        "(ii) Although international commodity prices went down, they nevertheless continue to be high.",
        "Consequently, Colombian terms of trade remain elevated and are propelling national income.",
        "However, according to the most recent data available (from July), the total value of Colombian exports has fallen as a result of a weakened external demand and a decrease in oil prices.",
        "(iii) In Colombia, GDP growth in the second quarter (annual 4.9%) exceeded the range (between 3.3% and 4.8%) estimated by the technical team.",
        "This underestimation was due to an increase in internal demand (annual 6.4%) above projections.",
        "Economic activity figures in the third quarter suggest that the annual GDP growth will be lower than in the second quarter.",
        "For the full year 2012, economic growth seems likely to be above the midpoint of the estimated range (between 3% and 5%).",
        "(iv) In August, credit growth continued to slow down, in this way diminishing financial imbalance risks.",
        "Real interest rates are standing at levels close to the average observed since year 2000.",
        "(v) Although inflation and the average of core inflation increased slightly in august, they are standing very close to the midpoint of the inflation range (at 3.1%).",
        "One-year inflation expectations remained stable at 3.3%, while those resulting from the Colombian 2, 3, and 5-year treasury bonds – TES – increase but continued to remain below 3% (the midpoint of the target range).",
        "Some Board members stressed that economic activity figures suggest that the economy is converging to its potential growth level in a context where core inflation measures and expectations are very close to the long-term target (3%).",
        "In addition, they highlighted the dynamism of domestic demand based on construction and work investments, the fact that credit is growing at significant rates, as well as the favorable terms of trade that continue to encourage national income, and the good behavior of employment.",
        "Real interest rates are standing at levels close to the averages estimated since 2000.",
        "The above indicates that the coherent monetary policy adopted by the Board is consistent with a sustainable long-term growth.",
        "Nonetheless, the new information will enable the Board to establish further monetary policy actions, both those concerning the development of events in the advanced countries and their impact on confidence, global demand and the international commodity prices, and those originating in domestic demand.",
        "Consequently, they have proposed to keep the reference interest rate unaltered.",
        "Other members emphasized the monetary policy needs to look forward.",
        "Global economic activity has continued to slow down, particularly in both the Eurozone and the Asian economies.",
        "The external context weakness, and especially the behavior of the prices of mining-energy products, make Colombian economy very vulnerable and will contaminate its internal economic performance.",
        "In the domestic economic activity, it is highlighted that inflation, as well as the expectations, have continued to converge to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "Although demand has remained dynamic by activity branches, when mining of works are excluded from the GDP a slight deceleration is observed and, above all, the poor behavior of industry is disquieting.",
        "Household consumption has continued to decelerate, and a fall of the consumer confidence index was observed.",
        "Since a good monetary policy lies in the ability to anticipate proper decisions, the Board members deemed that reducing the intervention interest rate is necessary AND According to the assessment of the current balance of risks, Banco de la Republica Board of Directors, by majority decision, has determined to keep its intervention interest rate unaltered.",
        "Therefore, the base rate for expansion actions will remain at 4.75%.",
        "The Board will continue to keep close watch on the international situation as well as on the behavior and projections of inflation, growth, and the asset markets, while reiterating that the monetary policy will depend upon the new information available.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Director’s Meeting of 27th July 2012 On 27[th] July 2012, in the city of Bogota, , the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica‟s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the Governor Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, as well as the perspectives for both are discussed and decisions relating with monetary policy are adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the most significant matters addressed at this meeting Annual consumer inflation in June stood at 3.20%, which means 24 basis points (bp) below last month‟s figure.",
        "This result can be explained by both a reduction in the annual variation of CPI without foods, which shifted from 2.94% in May to 2.81% in June, and a 50 bp decrease in the annual variation of the Consumer Prize Index (CPI) for food (4.22%) as compared with the previous month record.",
        "Year-to-date, a cumulative increase of 2.01% in CPI has been observed, lower than what was seen in the same period of 2011 (2.53%).",
        "In the CPI without foods, this decrease in annual variation was explained mainly by the regulated item component and, particularly, the domestic price of fuels which has been reacting to the lower international oil prices observed since April.",
        "The CPI for fuel shifted from 3.7% to 1.8%.",
        "Though of minor significance, falls were also suffered by the other regulated item components ( utilities and public transportation).",
        "Likewise, in June a reduction of 3.74% to 3.2%) was seen in the annual variation in the CPI for the non-tradables without foods and regulated items; it can be attributed in good part to a high comparison basis.",
        "However, a new increase of up to 3.7% was experienced in the annual variation of leases (8 bp more than in May).",
        "It had been 3.4% in December of the previous year and, since February 2011 (at 3.0%), has continued to rise interruptedly.",
        "Worth noting is the fact that leases account for about 19% in the total CPI.",
        "With respect to tradables without foods and regulated items, their result in June was 1.0%, similar to that in May though higher than the percentage observed in the first quarter of the year (about 0.7%).",
        "The lower annual peso appreciation in the past few months may be related to this phenomenon.",
        "The annual variation in the CPI for foods dropped from 4.72% in May to 4.22% en June.",
        "Perishable foods more generally affected by weather conditions were those having experienced the most noticeable decreases (from 1.1% to -2.0%), as explained in part by a recovery in the farming supply propelled by the relatively high prices of several of these food items until past year‟s third quarter.",
        "In the case of processed foods and meals eaten out of home, no significant changes were seen.",
        "The annual variation in this component stood relatively high at 5.5%, this suggesting some kind of demand and/or salary cost pressures in this sector.",
        "In the last month, a decrease in core inflation was noticed as well.",
        "The average of the three indicators watched over by Banco de la Republica stood at 3.35% as opposed to 3.20% in the previous month.",
        "The annual variation in the PPI also exhibit significant reductions in June with a figure standing in negative terrain (at -0.69%) for the first time in over two years.",
        "For December 2011, while the record was 5.5%, it stood at 0.8% for May.",
        "An important part of this fall is associated with the decrease in oil prices and the other fuels.",
        "Should this behavior prevail, it would point to diminishing non-salary cost pressures in the next months.",
        "Inflation expectations deriving form the TES (treasury securities) at different horizons declined in June; 5-year expectation stood below 3% after several months with higher records.",
        "2 and 3-year expectations remained below this figure in a slowdown trend.",
        "Those obtained from the monthly survey show an expected inflation of 3.1% for the end of this year and of 3.32% for July 2013, 17 bp and 14 bp respectively, below the record reported one month ago Growth The most recent information for the second quarter of 2012, especially with relation to private consumption and industry, suggests economic deceleration.",
        "Indicators relating to consumption, among which retail sales stand out, indicate that consumption during the second quarter had grown at a significant lower rate than in the first quarter of the year.",
        "In April and May, according to the DANE (the National Administrative Department of Statistics), retail sales contracted down to an average annual rate of 1,0% (the first annual fall registered in almost three years).",
        "If vehicle sales are excluded, the behavior is similar although, in this case, the average annual growth rate for April and May is 0.5%.",
        "Moderation observed in imports of consumer goods having shifted from a growth rate of 19% in the first quarter to an averaging 8% in April and May do also suggest deceleration in this type of spending.",
        "According to Econometrics, with data as of June, vehicle sales decreased 1% in annual terms and 0.6% on average for the quarter.",
        "Likewise, with figures as of June, a drop in the consumer confidence index was witnessed as measured by Fedesarrollo, this suggesting lower growth in consumption for this period as well.",
        "The lower growth in consumption for the second quarter coincides with a deceleration in the annual growth rate for credit with 25.1% in March to 21.2% in the first week of July, the above in an environment of stable interest rates remaining even below their 2000 averages (with the exception of the credit card rate).",
        "On the other hand, information relating to investment shows that although figures of capital goods imports as of May (having grown in the two- month period April May at an annual rate of 12% as opposed to 8% in the first quarter) indicate that this spending might be growing at a stronger pace than previously, the overall outlook for investment is uncertain due to the fact that it depends upon the speed of -work recovery.",
        "Regarding Colombian external sales in dollars, they grew 1.2% in May with respect to the same month in the previous year.",
        "This growth rate is lower than that observed in the past few months (17.6% on average per annum between January and April), and it can be explained by the 1% reduction in mining exports and a 12.4% fall in the foreign sales of major agricultural products.",
        "On their side, external sales for the remaining - particularly industrial - goods (accounting for 22% of the exported total) grew 14.6% in annual terms.",
        "On the supply side, indicators available suggest a backwards step for GDP in industry in annual terms in the second quarter.",
        "In April and May, also in annual terms, the industrial production index without coffee threshing contracted 1.3% on average, with its levels trending down.",
        "Although this fall was explained to a large extent by the chemical sectors reporting raw-material availability problems, even without these branches industrial production had contracted (annual 0.1% on average) in these months Other industry indicators also point to a weak behavior for the sector.",
        "Fedesarrollo indicators such as orders and stock as of May showed backward steps, although they still remain above their last 20-year averages.",
        "The foregoing caused a fall in the industrialist confidence index which, nevertheless, is smaller in its significance than the deceleration seen in the industrial production growth.",
        "Likewise, in the construction sector no indicators available suggest significant dynamism.",
        "In annual terms, cement production fell 0.8% on average in April and May while construction licenses showed an average annual contraction of 33% in the same months.",
        "In the case of the later, this strong fall is due to the atypically high levels they are being compared with.",
        "As per the farming sector, the recovery of coffee production having growth 18% per annum in the second quarter, as well as the increase in slaughtering of cattle in April and May let expect the sector to reverse its negative growth records from of the two previous quarters.",
        "All the above leads to think that GDP growth in 2012 would stand between 3% and 5%.",
        "Although consumption and investment will continue to be the major source of growth, they would grow less than in the previous year.",
        "By activity branches, mining and financial services would continue to be the most dynamic sectors, just as it was in the first quarter, while industry and construction would exhibit the lower performance.",

        "On its side in June, real interest rates (excluding CPI without foods) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary credits stood in this order at 15.85%, 10.02% and 9.27%, which were lower than their respective averages as estimated since 1998 (excluding mortgage, the average of which is measured from 2002 onwards) External Context During the second quarter of the year, the global economic activity weakened more than expected mostly due to increasing uncertainty generated by the European public debt crisis.",
        "For this reason, the likelihood of global deceleration and its deepening in 2013 is growing.",
        "For the next year, the most recent predictions of the major international agencies continue to point to a worldwide growth recovering as compared to 2012, although at a slower pace than estimated in previous months.",
        "Real activity indicators for the eurozone show that, likely, the economy had contracted more than foreseen in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Along this line, preliminary estimations of government agencies for France and Spain evidence that economic growth was negative between April and June.",
        "The poor behavior or peripheral economies in the region has significantly affected entrepreneur and consumer confidence and begun to reduce dynamism in the regional economies having showed sounder results until now.",
        "With respect to the labor market, the unemployment rate for the overall eurozone stood at 11.1% in June.",
        "This figure evidences an increase as compared with previous months.",
        "In addition, credit conditions have continued to narrow, this proving commercial banks‟ reluctance to reactivate credit.",
        "The most recent measures passed by the European authorities, such as the possibility of direct capitalization for the Spanish banking system through the use of resources from the region‟s rescue funds, and the 120.000 billion euros (equal to 1% of the region‟s GDP) to foster economic growth have temporarily reduced uncertainty; but they have not yet managed to persuade markets of the likelihood of a fast regional recovery.",
        "For instance, despite these announcements and the new fiscal austerity in Spain, pressures in the Spanish public debt prevail, partly due to doubts regarding the viability of this program, thus substantially increasing the risk premium.",
        "In the case of the United States, economic growth continued to be weak.",
        "In addition, recent consumption and manufacturing activity indicators went through a slowdown in the pat few months.",
        "The most recent register of the manufacturer sentiment index fell into negative terrain, in this way giving clues about probable deceleration in production in the next months.",
        "Although the housing market has showed some recovery signs, these are still incipient and take place at very low levels, thus not being able to indicate production acceleration.",

        "The lower expansion rhythm in the developed economies has limited growth in the emerging ones, particularly in the Asian countries, where the commercial ties with Europe are stronger in this context, GDP growth decelerated again in China in the second quarter of the year by shifting from to 8.1% to 7.6% in annual terms.",
        "With regard to the Latin American case, no growth reactivation can be seen in Brazil despite the encouraging measures.",
        "Other economies like Mexico, Chile and Venezuela show a better performance in their indicators, though in May some deceleration was seen in the Mexican and Chilean industrial activity.",

        "Excess global capacity and lower international prices for commodities (with the exception of some agricultural goods) have moderated inflationary pressures and permitted the introduction of expansionary monetary policies in a significant number of countries.",
        "For instance, in the emerging economies, the Central Banks of Brazil, China and South Korea have recently lowered their interest rates in an attempt to counteract the effects of a deceleration in demand.",
        "In the advanced economies, monetary policy continues to be lax; if the global environment deteriorates further, the central banks of this group of countries might decide to implement more encouraging measures.",
        "In brief, in the remainder of 2012 similarly to what is taking place in several emerging countries, the weakening of world economy is expected to affect the growth of the Colombian economy in a negative manner through less external demand and lower international prices for the main export products AND By a majority of its members, the Board of Directors agreed to reduce by 25 bp its intervention interest rate.",
        "In this manner, the base rate for expansion auctions will be 5%.",
        "This decision was made upon taking the following factors into account: (i) Economic growth worldwide continues to weaken more than expected.",
        "Information suggests a slower growth rhythm in the United States while it keeps contracting in the eurozone.",
        "In China and other emerging economies, the slowdown in growth has been worse than predicted, thus mirroring the weakening of both world demand and the previous political actions.",
        "(ii) Excess global capacity and lower international prices for basic products (with the exception of some agricultural goods) have moderated inflationary pressures and allowed the introduction of expansive policies in a significant number of countries.",
        "In the emerging economies, for example, the central banks of Brazil, China and South Korea have recently lowered their interest rate in an attempt to counteract the effects of deceleration in demand.",
        "(iii) The weakening of global economy is negatively affecting Colombian economic growth as a result of less external demand and lower international prices for its major export products.",
        "These factors are likely to continue working in the same direction in the next few quarters.",
        "Although both consumption and investment are to be the main source of GDP growth in 2012, these components of internal demand will growth less than in the previous year and are very likely to reduce, even eliminate, the current production capacity pressures.",
        "(iv) Generally, with the new information available, a 3% to 5% growth in the GDP has been projected.",
        "This range width is due to uncertainty around the size of global slowdown and its impact on the Colombian economy, as well as with respect to the recovery of works and the overcoming of some negative supply shocks currently affecting the industrial and mining sectors.",
        "Growth similar to 2012‟s is projected for 2013.",
        "As would be expected, uncertainty levels increase as the forecast horizon grows.",

        "All core inflation measures have dropped and their average stood close to 3.0%.",
        "Inflation expectations also go down: 3.1% is expected for December 2012 and about 3.3% for July 2013, while those deriving from the treasury „TES‟ bonds at horizons between two and five years are around 2.5%.",
        "A majority of Board members considered that lowering the intervention interest rate by 25 bp was appropriate.",
        "Excess spending in the economy has been reduced at a higher speed than expected, and credit growth has become more moderated.",
        "Likewise, both inflation and inflation expectations have fallen.",
        "Although some of the factors having weakened internal spending growth are expected to reverse soon (like, for instance, the notorious decline of investment in works), those associated with external factors will likely prevail in the next few quarters.",
        "With respect to the future behavior of inflation, goal deviation risks are low and, up to now, they are limited to a temporary increase of food prices in 2013 to be corrected in the second semester of that year.",
        "Moreover, at this time the risk of a reduction of 25 bp in the intervention interest rate would unlikely increase financial unbalance risks subsequently threatening to jeopardize employment and product growth.",
        "This reduction in the intervention interest rate evidences a change in the monetary stance; it shows the Board‟s commitment to maximizing employment and product growth in harmony with the attainment of inflation targets, and it has been defined by envisaging its effects in several markets simultaneously, taking into account the presence of uncertainty and carefully assessing its risks.",
        "Other members deemed appropriate a 50 bp reduction in the Bank‟s intervention interest rate since, according to information available, it has been confirmed that international economic deterioration is much worse than foreseen in the past few months, while the likelihood of further accentuation of this negative trend grows day after day.",
        "In the domestic environment, it can be seen that industry is in the path of contraction; according to indicators available, consumption in the second quarter might have grown significantly less than in the first quarter, like the GDP, which would register deceleration for a third consecutive quarter while there is an increasing perception of risk at the local level and both consumer and entrepreneur confidence indices have fallen.",
        "This indicates that economic activity would to continue to loose strength According to the assessment of the current balance of risks, the Board of Directors agreed to reduce Banco de la Republica intervention interest rate by 25 basis points.",

        "The Board confirms that Banco de la Republica has both the tools and sufficient resources to meet the liquidity needs in local and foreign currencies usually required by the economy, as well as those likely to be felt in an environment of international financial turbulence.",
        "The Board will continue to keep a close eye on the international situation, inflation behavior and projections as well as growth and the performance of asset markets; and it restates that monetary policy will depend upon the new information available.",

        "Recent developments in inflationAnnual consumer inflation declined in November for the third consecutive month and was at 2.77%, 29 basis points (bp) less than was registered the month before.",
        "Based on this information, the accumulated inflation over the course of the year is 2.34%.",
        "The annual change in the prices for the basket of food and the one excluding it showed significant reductions during this month.In the case of the CPI for food, the annual variation dropped significantly in November.",
        "The change was 3.0%, which is 55 bp below what had been registered the previous month.",
        "This basket has been showing a declining trend with a few minor interruptions since the beginning of 2011.",
        "This was possible because of the positive performance of prices for perishables which saw an annual change of -1.95% during the month, a change that was 130 bp less than what was registered in October.",
        "There has also been a downswing in the annual variation of the CPI for processed food (3.12%) in the last few months.",
        "This has helped the aggregate’s declining trend.",
        "Since June 2012, the reduction in the annual change has been 200 bp.",
        "Last of all, the annual change in the area of eating away from home declined 20 bp in the last month and was at 5.1%.In the CPI excluding food, the bulk of the drop in the annual change in prices in November was concentrated in the basket of regulated items.",
        "The annual variation for this was at 2.8%, the lowest amount registered in the last three years.",
        "The drop in the price for fuel last month contributed significantly to this result.",
        "There was also a reduction in the annual adjustment of the CPI for public transportation in November.",
        "In utilities, there were monthly declines in the CPI for electricity and gas.The other two components of the CPI excluding food –tradables and non-tradables– also showed reductions in the annual changes this last month although these were milder than the ones seen in the basket of regulated items.",
        "In the former, the annual variation was at 0.94%, which indicated a decline of 12 bp in comparison to what had been seen in October.",
        "Since June 2012, the annual change in this basket has been close to 1%.",
        "This result could be partly associated with the appreciation of the exchange rate.The CPI for non-tradables excluding food and regulated items registered 3.97% in November, 6 bp less than what had been registered in October.",
        "This result could be due to the aggregate demand, which has seen a slowdown since midyear.",
        "This may have contained more pronounced price adjustments.",
        "It is noteworthy that the area of rentals, which has shown a growth trend for the last two years, showed a slight drop at this point (4 bp) and went to 3.9%.",
        "A few other services also presented a dropping annual change and contributed to the aggregate result.Core inflation also fell this last month.",
        "The average of the four indicators of core inflation that are monitored by the Bank declined for the third consecutive month as it went from 3.11% in October to 2.96% in November.The annual variation in the PPI remained in negative territory and continued dropping as it went to -1.6% in November.",
        "Part of this decline is due to agricultural prices, but it can also be seen in mining and manufacturing.",
        "The appreciation of the exchange rate and the lower international prices partly explain this phenomenon also.According to the monthly survey of analysts at financial institutions, the inflation expected as of December of this year is 2.63% and that expected in 12 months is 3.12%.",
        "This represents a downswing in comparison to the results from last month.",
        "The expectations derived from the TES (with figures as of December 12) came to about 2.5% for the 2- to 5-year horizon.",
        "This is 40 to 50 bp lower than it was a month ago    GrowthIn the third quarter of 2012, the GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.1%, which is below the lower limit of the range predicted in the September Inflation Report (between 3.3% and 4.8%).",
        "This figure indicates a significant slowdown in comparison to the economic growth in the second quarter (4.9%) and one that was more marked than expected.",
        "In quarterly terms, this means a drop of 0.7%, which is the first one in the last seven quarters.By expenditure components, the slowdown appeared mostly in domestic demand and in exports also.",
        "In the case of the former, the annual growth was 2.4% compared to 7.1% in the second quarter.",
        "The lower growth of the GDP and of domestic demand originated from the area of gross fixed capital formation, specifically from the poor performance of investments in public works projects, construction and buildings, and transportation equipment.",
        "The results in these areas showed a significant contraction in annual terms that was not foreseen (-14.9%, -10.7%, and -10.9% respectively).",
        "With respect to public works, there were sharp drops in the investment in mining and in construction of highways and other roads.",
        "In investment in buildings, the lower outlays occurred in both housing and non-residential construction.In contrast, the strength of private (4%) and public (4.8%) consumption in the third quarter was similar to what had been seen in the second and better than expected even when the growth of durable goods presented an annual contraction of 5.9% in the third quarter of 2012.",
        "Exports, which had grown at more than a real 11% in 2011, have been slowing down so far in 2012 and, in the third quarter, they grew 2.5%.",
        "This largely reflects the effect of the global slowdown on Colombia’s foreign trade as well as the drops seen in the production of petroleum and coal in the third quarter due to supply shocks which will provisionally be transitory.",
        "Likewise, in line with the lower strength of domestic demand, the real growth of imports has declined from 21.5% in 2011 to 8.8% in the third quarter of 2012.Regarding supply, in addition to the contraction in the branch of construction (public works projects and buildings), the stagnation of the industrial GDP (with an annual growth rate of -0.1%) as well as the very low growth in mining and quarrying (0.5%) stand out in the third quarter.",
        "The poor results for this latter branch contrast with its significant rate of expansion seen in the first half of this year (10.8%) and is the result of supply shocks in the production of oil and coal.",
        "Commerce, which is a branch that carries a lot of weight in the GDP, slowed from 4.3% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third.",
        "The areas of transportation and financial GDP also presented slowdowns.",
        "In contrast, the GDP for not only agriculture but also social, community, and personal services surged.With respect to the fourth quarter, the indicators available suggest that, in the area of private consumption, the performance will be similar to the one in the third quarter.",
        "The Fedesarrollo consumer confidence index remained above its historic average, which has been calculated since 2001, and was similar to what it was in September and October.",
        "In fact, the average so far in the fourth quarter surpassed what was seen in the third quarter.",
        "There was also a 22.4% increase in imports of consumer goods in dollars during October compared to the same month last year.",
        "This represents a sharp surge in comparison to the last few months.",
        "Last of all, bank loans for consumption, which had been dropping in previous months, not do so in November.",
        "Rather, they grew at an annual rate (18.9%) that was similar to the rate registered in October.",
        "However, these results contrast with the indicator for total retail sales, which declined 0.3% annually (excluding cars, the dip was 0.2%).",
        "In September, the annual growth had been 2.3% (6.2% excluding automobiles).",
        "Uncertainty is high for public consumption and investment in public works projects, especially considering the high volatility that this series has been showing recently.In October, Colombian exports in dollars grew 5.2% in comparison to the same month in 2011 (5.8% if the re-export of airplanes is included).",
        "This performance is due to the annual increases in the values shipped in the areas of industry and others (18%), agricultural goods (3.3%), and mining products (1.7%).",
        "Within these last two groups, the annual growth in exports of coal and flowers (38.6% and 16% respectively) stands out.",
        "In the industrial group, vehicles (73.6%), chemical products (10.4%), and food and beverages (10%) contributed the most to the growth of foreign sales.Regarding supply indicators, industrial production for October grew at an annual rate of 1.2%.",
        "By sub-branches, the strongest ones were beverages (13.4%), vehicles (13.4%), other food products (11.1%), and milling and flour (7.3%).",
        "The most recent results of the Fedesarrollo business opinion survey of industry, which include information as of November, do not point to changes in the performance of the sector for the last two months of the year.",
        "Orders stopped showing additional drops and the level of inventory declined.",
        "Likewise, the index of business confidence maintained its downward trend but not show additional drops.",
        "The Banco de la Republica’s regional survey for October showed a similar trend in that it suggested that businessmen in industry had slightly improved their perception of the current sales while their outlook for the next 12 months continued to be less favorable.",
        "For commerce, the Fenalco and Fedesarrollo indicators show dissimilar signs.",
        "According to Fenalco, businessmen registered an improvement in their outlook with respect to the situation for current sales in November while their expectations continued to be unfavorable.",
        "However, Fedesarrollo’s monthly survey suggested that both the current outlook and expectations for six months from now had improved in the last two months.To summarize, the GDP data for the third quarter and the most recent numbers for the fourth quarter of 2012 suggest that the growth for the entire year could be less than 4%.",
        "The greater uncertainty in this forecast again goes back to the performance of investment, mainly the investment allocated to public works projects and building.For 2013, some of the factors that have stopped investment in 2012 are expected to turn around thus driving domestic demand by this route.",
        "This is the case, for example, for some investment projects in the mining-energy sector which suffered delays this year.",
        "Something similar should be seen in the area of highway and other road construction.",
        "In addition, the conditions that support the strength seen in consumption and investment in machinery and equipment will continue in 2013.",
        "These include the stable levels of employment and consumer confidence and the reduction in policy interest rates in the second half of 2012, which are being transmitted to the lending interest rates    Financial VariablesThere was a pause in the moderate growth bank credit (N/ and F/C) had seen in November.",
        "Its annual rate of growth was 15.2%, which was 12 bp higher in comparison to the rate in October and 226 bp lower when it is compared to the rate in June.This performance was seen in all the types of credit.",
        "The commercial loan portfolio in national currency registered an annual rise of 14.3% in November, which was slightly higher than the one seen the month before (14.1%) and lower than the rise seen in the first half of the year (16.9%).",
        "For the component in foreign currency, the annual growth was 5.8% thus continuing a limited recovery from the level seen in July (2%).",
        "The consumer loan portfolio likewise rallied a little between October (18.6%) and November (18.9%) but its growth was lower than that of June (22.2%).",
        "The mortgage loan portfolio, in turn, has shown a more stable performance with annual variations of 15.4% in November, 15.5% in October, and 16.4% in June.The real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) for the November disbursements of consumer loans was 15.4%; for mortgages, 10%; for ordinary commercial loans, 9.2%; and for preferential ones, 5.7%.",
        "These levels are below their respective historical averages as calculated since the year 2000.",
        "The real interest rates for loans granted through credit cards and for treasury bonds were at 26.7% and 5.5%.",
        "These rates are above the averages calculated since the year 2000    Foreign ContextFor the fourth quarter of 2012, the new information on developed countries shows that economic activity is weaker than what was expected.",
        "The Euro zone is still in recession and its largest economies (Germany and France) are showing signs of contraction while the United States is again showing signs of a slowdown.",
        "In the emerging countries, the new economic indicators for China suggest a recovery.",
        "Some indicators for Brazil point to its economic recovery continuing its slow rate of growth.",
        "In Chile and Peru, growth remains robust primarily based on their domestic demand.Based on numbers from -December, the indices of manufacturing activity and services in the Euro zone remained in contracting territory while, in November, business and consumer confidence remained depressed.",
        "It is noteworthy that the weakness of the region does not belong exclusively to the economies on the periphery.",
        "Rather, the soundest countries in Europe, with Germany leading them, have been losing their buoyancy.In the United States, in turn, some indicators of productive activity continue to show weakness.",
        "This is especially true in the case of retail sales and industrial activity, which are showing a virtual stagnation based on the figures for November.",
        "The uncertainty with respect to fiscal management has begun to affect consumer confidence in addition to the effect it is having on the investment decisions companies are making.",
        "On the positive side, the unemployment rate declined again in November and the housing market continues to show signs of recovery though still at a very low level.In the case of the emerging economies in Asia, economic growth declined in the majority of the countries during the third quarter.",
        "However, based on the figures from November, retail sales and industrial activity in China surged again and this situation will contribute to the recovery of the region’s performance.In Latin America, growth in the third quarter surged in Brazil, Chile, and Peru while Mexico and Venezuela maintained their favorable rate.",
        "In spite of the fact that the growth of the Brazilian economy was higher, it was still much lower than the analysts expected.",
        "This situation raised the risk perception of that country a little.Regarding the international prices for commodities, the prices for petroleum have remained below what was seen in the first half of the year but relatively high in historical terms.",
        "The prices for coffee continued their downward trend.",
        "Thus, even though the terms of trade for November are lower than those seen at the beginning of the year, they are still historically high and contribute to the support of Colombia’s income.",
        "The terms of trade are expected to be relatively stable for 2013.The lower international prices for commodities together with the slowdown in demand, primarily in developed countries, have contributed to the reduction of inflation in those countries.",
        "Likewise, in Latin America, with the exception of Brazil, prices have maintained a downward trend in the last few months.",
        "In the case of the Asian economies, no common trend can be seen.The low inflationary pressures and a negative output gap have allowed the central banks in developed countries to keep their interest rates close to zero.",
        "In the emerging economies, the benchmark interest rates are at about their natural point.",
        "These situations are not expected to change in 2013 as a result of which, the abundance of international liquidity will continue.The risks that weigh on the global economy for 2013 are still the same ones identified in the previous minutes and are centered around the fiscal quandary in the US and in the unfolding of the European situation.",
        "The possibility exists that the fiscal stimulus in China will favor greater growth in that country and help to offset a weaker trend in Europe and the United States.Considering all of the above, it is feasible that the average growth of Colombia’s trading partners could be somewhat weaker in 2013 than what was estimated before even though an amount that is higher than the growth in 2012 is still being predicted     AND OPTIONSThe board members’ main points of discussion focused on the following aspects:(i) The growth of the GDP for the third quarter in 2012 (2.1%) was below the range projected by the technical team at the Banco de la Republica (between 3.3% and 4.8%).",
        "Domestic demand slowed down significantly from 7.1% in the second quarter to 2.4% in the third.",
        "All of this is due to a sharp and unexpected tightening of investment, especially investment in public works projects and buildings.",
        "In public works, there were large reductions in investment in mining and in highway and other road construction.",
        "With respect to investment in buildings, the drop occurred in both housing and non-residential buildings.",
        "(ii) In contrast, the strength of private (4%) and public (4.8%) consumption in the third quarter was similar to what had been seen in the second and a little better than had been expected.",
        "This was in spite of the fact that the growth of durable goods showed an annual contraction of 5.9% in the third quarter of 2012.",
        "Exports, in turn, which had grown at above a real 11% in 2011, have been slowing down over the course of 2012 and, in the third quarter, grew 2.5%.",
        "This reflects to a large degree the effect of the global slowdown on Colombian foreign trade.",
        "Likewise, the real growth of imports has dropped from 21.5% in 2011 to 8.8% in the third quarter of 2012 and this is consistent with the lower strength of domestic demand.",
        "(iii) Recent data on the worldwide economy has not changed much from what was reported in the press release from the last Board meeting.",
        "International uncertainty has stayed the same.",
        "Some international economic indicators have improved a little.",
        "The weakness of a large number of industrialized economies and the lack of inflationary pressure makes it possible to expect foreign interest rates to remain low for a prolonged period of time.",
        "(iv) The previous results and the new economic figures from the fourth quarter of 2012 suggest that growth for the entire year could be lower than 4%.",
        "The greater uncertainty in this forecast again originates from the behavior of investment, mainly that allocated to public works and buildings.",
        "(v) Some of the factors that have stopped investment in 2012 are expected to turn around in 2013 thus driving domestic demand by this route.",
        "This, for example, is the case with some of the investment projects in the mining-energy sector which have suffered delays this year.",
        "Something similar should be seen in the area of highway construction and construction of other roads.",
        "In addition, the conditions that support the strength seen in consumption and in the investment in machinery and equipment will continue in 2013.",
        "These include, the stable levels of employment and consumer confidence and the reduction in policy interest rates in the second half of 2012.",
        "The latter are being transmitted to the lending interest rates.",
        "Last of all, in the foreign context, a growth of the worldwide economy that is slightly above what was registered in 2012, terms of trade that are relatively stable, and abundant international liquidity are anticipated.",
        "Under these conditions, economic growth in 2013 that is higher than what was projected for this year is expected.",
        "(vi) The results of inflation in November were lower than expected.",
        "This was mainly due to the performance of regulated and food prices.",
        "Inflation, the average of the core inflation indicators, and the majority of the measurements of inflation expectations are below the target of 3%.",
        "With the new information available, this situation is anticipated to stay the same for a period of time.",
        "(vii) In November, there was a pause in the moderate growth bank loans (N/ and F/C) have seen.",
        "Their annual rate of growth was 15.2%, which is 12 bp higher than it was in October and 226 bp lower when it is compared to the rate in June.",
        "This performance was seen in all the types of credit.",
        "The commercial loan portfolio in national currency registered an annual rise of 14.3% in November, which is slightly higher than the one seen the month before (14.1%) and lower than the rise seen in the first half of the year (16.9%).",
        "For the component in foreign currency, the annual growth was 5.8% thus continuing a limited recovery from the level seen in July (2%).",
        "The consumer loan portfolio likewise rallied a little between October (18.6%) and November (18.9%) but its growth was lower than that of June (22.2%).",
        "The mortgage loan portfolio, in turn, has shown a more stable performance with annual variations of 15.4% in November, 15.5% in October, and 16.4% in June.The majority of the board members thought it would be appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate 25 bp considering the new information on various fronts.",
        "On the one hand, based on the data from November, both the inflation currently observed and that forecast for three quarters from now are below the long term target in a context in which no inflationary pressure can be seen from higher costs or climatic factors.",
        "On the other, the data with respect to the growth of the GDP for the third quarter points to a sharper than expected slowdown in economic activity which indicates the possibility of excess productive capacity (negative output gap).",
        "The reasons for this sharper slowdown in the economy could be blamed on problems that have been well-defined.",
        "As is well-known, external conditions have been negatively affecting international commerce and the prices of exported goods for several quarters.",
        "Even if these prices remain at historically high levels, they are lower than the ones registered in the first half of the year.",
        "More recently, a slump in domestic demand mainly associated with the contraction of investment in public works and in housing and non-residential construction has been added to this.",
        "This tightening is largely explained by exogenous factors that are administrative and regulatory in type and that could be overcome, although only partially, in the short term.",
        "Finally, even if the growth of the loan portfolio has stabilized at relatively high levels, these levels could be more a reflection of greater financial deepening in the economy than excessive indebtedness on the part of the agents.Other members underlined the fact that almost all the indicators on the economy’s progress indicate it is obviously deteriorating: industry is contracting (with a negative growth of -0.1% in the third quarter) in the midst of a sharp fall in the rate of growth of domestic demand for nationally produced products.",
        "These include specifically the iron and steel, textile, clothing, shoe, leather manufacturing, processed food sectors, etc.",
        "which are showing the effects of obvious weakness.",
        "In addition, a migration from national production to sales of imported goods can be seen, especially clothing, shoes, and manufactured leather products.",
        "Commerce is seeing mediocre growth driven mainly by the imports of consumer goods.",
        "The growth rates of large scale mining are dropping considerably and construction is evidently contracting.",
        "Leading indicators such as consumption of durable goods and investment in housing showed negative growth rates in the third quarter.",
        "On the international plane, demand in general continues its slowdown.",
        "In Asia, China has some signs of recovery but India and South Korea, etc.",
        "In Europe, the strong economies are being infected by those on the periphery and confidence is dropping.",
        "In the United States, exports continue to weaken.",
        "In Latin America, even though the strength of growth in Chile and Peru is remaining steady, Brazil will only grow about 1% this year.",
        "In conclusion, the slowdown in the economy is much stronger than it was expected to be and the output gap has probably gone into negative territory.",
        "Regarding inflation, no risk is seen in the medium term – overall it fell to 2.77%.",
        "The average for core inflation was below the -point of the target range for the first time.",
        "Inflation excluding food was at 2.68%.",
        "Inflation for food declined to 3.1%.",
        "Every day it becomes more probable that the Niño phenomenon will not occur this coming year.",
        "All inflation expectations also declined.",
        "The expectations for inflation excluding food 12 months from now fell to 2.8% and, in the area of agricultural commodities on the international level, prices are generally receding.",
        "Finally, a significant slowdown in the strength of credit can be seen.",
        "As a consequence, they proposed that the benchmark interest rate be reduced 50 basis points.Another co-director stated that even if the data from the GDP, private demand, and inflation make it possible to predict the existence of a moderate excess of installed capacity, this is not the only variable that should be taken into account when establishing the posture of monetary policy.",
        "The different agents in the productive sector, especially households, show elevated levels of leverage that, fortunately, have been declining over the last six months.",
        "A benchmark interest rate that is well below the long term interest rate could reverse this adjustment process (which the figures that are available from last month are beginning to hint at) and increase the vulnerability of the productive sector.",
        "The current benchmark interest rate is low in historical terms and additional reductions would move it even further away from a rate that could be considered neutral for an economy that has not suffered financial crises nor generalized bankruptcies in the productive sector in the recent past.",
        "To conclude, the current policy posture is expansionary and suitable for alleviating a moderate output gap without exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the productive sector     DECISIONBased on the evaluation of the balance of risks, the majority on the Board of Directors decided it would be suitable to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 4.25%.The Board reiterates that the Banco de la Republica has sufficient tools and resources to cover liquidity needs in the national and foreign currency that the economy regularly requires and those that could appear in an environment of international financial turbulence.The Board will continue to monitor the performance and projections for economic activity and inflation in the country, the asset markets, and international situation carefully.",
        "Finally, they reiterate that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Director’s Meeting of 28th May 2012 On 28[th] May 2012, in the city of Bogota, , the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica’s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the Governor Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, as well as the perspectives for both situations are discussed, and decisions relating with the monetary policy are adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the major subjects addressed at this meeting Backgrounds Annual consumer inflation in April stood at 3.43%, which means 3 basic points above the previous month’s record.",
        "This result can be explained to a great extent by an increase in the annual variation of GDP for food which shifted form 4.56% in March to 5.01% in April.",
        "Rises in the CPI for foods came from the processed food baskets (rice among others) and meals eaten out of home.",
        "In the latter case, annual variation has already climbed to 5.9%, likely due to the sharp growth experienced in domestic demand.",
        "On the other hand, the annual variation of perishable foods continued to decline, which suggests that farming supply conditions are tnding to return to normal.",
        "Moreover, the CPI without foods recorded a fall in its annual variation, as explained by a significant deceleration in the CPI for regulated items (from 4.9% to 3.8%) that was concentrated in electric power fees.",
        "In addition, the brake put on the international oil price since the end of February has made minor adjustments possible to domestic fuel prices.",
        "With respect to the annual variation in prices for tradables without foods and regulated items, a non-anticipated acceleration (from 0.7% to 0.9% in March) took place, relating to a sharp adjustment in telephone fees and a lower price appreciation in April as compared to previous months.",
        "Worth mentioning is the fact that the peso ceased being appreciated since -March and its depreciation began since -May.",
        "On the other hand, the annual variation in the CPI for non- tradables without foods and regulated items rose 6 bp in the month, and ended up close to 3.8%.",
        "Leases continued to accelerate on a gradual basis as it has been occurring for over twelve months now up to 3.6% Core inflation indicators rose after having remained virtually unchanged for two months.",
        "The average of the three indicators monitored by Banco de la Republica closed at 3.3%, which means 7 bp more than in the previous month.",
        "In April, the annual variation of the PPI remained at 1.6, in this manner consolidating the fall experienced in the previous months.",
        "In the case of the PPI for imported items, the accumulated appreciation of the peso kept the annual variation in negative terrain, though upward, while the local PPI continued to decelerate as leaning on a lower adjustment rhythm in farming prices.",
        "Inflation expectations deriving from the TES (treasury securities) at different horizons increased slightly in the past month and are standing above 3.0%, while those obtained from the monthly survey not show significant changes: inflation expected as of December is 3.3%, and 12-month inflation is 3.5%.",
        "The most recent indicators regarding the economic behavior in the first quarter of 2012 exhibit mixed signals.",
        "On the one hand, household consumption would have accelerated with respect to what was registered by the end of last year while, in the other hand, the industry grew very little in this period.",
        "The good behavior foreseen for private consumption in the fist quarter is based on the dynamics of commerce sales with a 5.1% growth (according to the National Administrative Department of Statistics – DANE), which continue to show an upward trend.",
        "In addition, imports in dollars of consumption goods grew 10.3% in March, as propelled mainly by imports of non-durable goods.",
        "Likewise, private consumption would have been favored by the good conditions existing at the labor market, since the unemployment rate has continued to decline while total and salaried employment are exhibiting relatively high (about 5%) positive annual growth rates.",
        "With respect to supply indicators, the fall in oil and coffee production in the previous months adds to the rather modest behavior of the manufacturing sector having contracted 0.9% in March in annual terms.",
        "With this record, industry production grew 1.7% on an annual basis in the first quarter, this being the lowest figure for a whole tree-month period since 2009.",
        "In analyzing production by sub-sectors, it is found that half of them are stagnant or even counter falling.",
        "In construction, cement production moved backward in the first quarter as compared to the previous one, although it shows important annual growths (of about 8%).",
        "Besides, in the area approved of, according to construction licenses, a strong annual contraction (18%) was recorded in the first quarter.",
        "Although this fall is due to comparing the current record with past year’s high levels, also some stagnation in the indicator can be seen.",
        "As for Colombian exports, they experienced and annual growth of 16.1% in March (in dollars).",
        "This behavior can be explained by the increase of external sales of commodities of mining origin, particularly oil and coal.",
        "On the other hand, agricultural exports declined 15% in annual terms, owing to the fall in coffee and banana sales.",
        "The reduction in the remaining exports was 1.5% due to a comparison basis effect, since their value had increased in a significant manner with respect to the two previous months.",
        "By incorporating the above information, a deceleration was seen in the GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 as opposed to the fourth quarter of the previous year, in annual terms.",
        "The negative behavior of the industry would have been offset by the commercial sector’s dynamism.",
        "For the second quarter, the scarce information available points to deceleration in household consumption.",
        "On the one hand, vehicle sales grew 2.4% less than a half of what had been observed (5.6%) in the first quarter.",
        "Worth highlighting is the fact that these goods bolstered the expansion of household spending to a great extent in previous months.",
        "On the other hand, in May, slight moderation in the consumption portfolio growth was noticed, with an annual growth rate of 23.2% (as of May 4), as compared with 25% registered in March.",
        "The Fedesarrollo business opinion survey for April showed a good performance for several indicators (orders, stocks, production expectations and so forth).",
        "Year-to-date, these behaviors have taken place simultaneously with stagnant trend growth rate levels in the industry.",
        "Therefore, this might suggest that this tendency may continue in the second quarter.",
        "Given the above, projections for full year 2012 submitted in the March Inflation Report not change.",
        "The forecast interval remains between 4.0% and 6.0% Financial Variables Total credit in national and foreign currency (“MN” and “ME”) registered in April an annual increase of 18.3%, 135 and 499 bp below those of March and July 2011, respectively.",
        "This behavior was determined by the commercial loan portfolio, the growth of which stood at 15.9%, this rate being 160 bp less than in the previous month, and adding a 745 bp deceleration in the past nine months.",
        "As for household credit, that destined for consumption having stabilized at a 25% grew rate between July 2011 and March 2012 kept a moderation in the last weeks with a reduction of 25% in March to 23.3% as of May 4.",
        "On the other and, the mortgage portfolio showed in April an annual growth of 16.9%, this record being close to the average (17.2%) since July 2011 Moreover, real interest rates in April (discarding CPI without foods) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary commerce credit, in that order, stood at 16.3%, 10.3%, and 9.3%, these rates being lower than their respective averages estimated since 1998 (excluding mortgage credit, the average of which is measured from May 2002) External Context For the first quarter of the year, the most recent data of global economic activity show better growth than expected in some developed economies (Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the United States), along with records below the forecasts in certain countries of the European periphery (Spain and Italy), and more deceleration than predicted in some emerging economies (like China and Brazil).",
        "In the United Sates, production continued to expand rather slowly, while real activity indicators suggest that this trend tends to continue.",
        "In the eurozone, although production came to a halt in the first quarter of the year, it nevertheless was higher than expected by the analysts and the Bank’s technical team.",
        "The larger expansion of German economy with relation to the rest of the region prevented it from sliding into a recession.",
        "If this country’s production is excluded, the result would be a eurozone growth having remained in contractive terrain for three quarters.",
        "More recent data as of April such as consumer and entrepreneur’s confidence in the U manufacturing and service sectors show that they have been kept at low levels.",
        "In the case of the eurozone, confidence is slightly more deteriorated as compared with previous months, just like some real activity indicators; all this suggests, as foreseen, that growth in the second quarter would be negative.",
        "With respect to emerging economies, the effects of the European crisis have already begun to affect the major economies in Emerging Asia.",
        "Therefore, both exports and industrial production have continued to decelerate and some of them have contracted.",
        "In the Latin American economies, signals are mixed.",
        "On the one hand, real activity has continued to decelerate in Brazil despite the economic authorities’ efforts towards economic reactivation in the country.",
        "On the other hand, economies like Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela go on growing at a good pace, although some of them with increases below their true potential.",
        "The highest risk perception has heightened volatility in the international capital markets and been translated into a slight increase in the risk premiums in the region’s economies, together with a depreciation of their currencies with respect to the United States dollar.",
        "With relation to international oil prices, the reduced tensions in the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as the high oil inventories in the United States and increased fears of a recession in Europe, have helped decrease these prices.",
        "Nevertheless, the levels continue to be favorable for the exporting economies.",
        "In this context, monetary policy in the advanced economies continues to be lax and no hardening is expected in the few next quarters.",
        "Conversely, if the global environment becomes more deteriorated, the central banks in this group of countries will implement more encouragement measures.",
        "In brief, results as of March suggest that the GDP of the country’s trade partners may grow in 2012 at a positive rate, though lower than the rate seen in 2011.",
        "The few figures of April’s real global activity continue pointing out to a deceleration scenario worldwide.",
        "The international financial market is awaiting the result of the elections to be carried out in Greece on 17[th] June.",
        "There is a strong likelihood that a new elected government led by the Syriza left-wing party would be willing to renegotiate or even reverse the structural reforms and fiscal commitments accepted by the former government as a condition to have access to the second financial rescue at the beginning of the year.",
        "The non-performance of these commitments would stop the flow of rescue and external finance funds, this entailing for the country, among other things, sovereign debt default, a banking crisis and, with it, the imminent Greek exit from the Euro.",
        "This scenario might have serious consequences for the economies in the whole eurozone with regard to Greece’s official and private debt default, since this would bring enormous losses for both the European Governments and banking system.",
        "Likewise, the probable exist of Greece from the eurozone might infect other countries in the region.",
        "Debt default by the Greeks would increase the pressure on the sovereign debt of other economies in the European periphery and increase its problems, in this manner punishing the cost of these countries’ debt still further by making it be perceived as more risky.",
        "Should larger countries like Spain or Italy arrive to this situation, the rescue funds of the BCE (the European Central Bank) and the IMF might be insufficient to provide some relief.",
        "The European banking system is already in a precarious situation; therefore, a significant financial shock like the one that may occur if Greece does not remain in the euro might affect it still further with very intense repercussions in the real sector.",
        "Even the likelihood of possible bank runs in the European periphery is beginning to be contemplated in the face of general fear of financial system bankruptcy.",
        "In the last few weeks, the financial markets have been equally attentive to the evolution of the banking system in Spain.",
        "By -April, the Spanish government found itself in the need of intervening Bankia, one of the largest commercial banks, as a result of the high exposure of this entity to the real estate sector having increased the amount of bad credits.",
        "Bankia capitalization reveals the week situation of the Spanish banking system and its high exposure to the real estate sector.",
        "Although the other major banks in the country do not show the same problems, this cannot be affirmed in the case of smaller entities.",
        "In the face of this situation, the Spanish government intervention in other banks is not to be dismissed, and this would compromise further its fiscal situation.",
        "For fear that this may become generalized in other countries, the European Committee has suggested that the region’s rescue fund may be used to capitalize those banks in need for those resources.",
        "Nevertheless, the idea has not had the German support and, even if it is eventually approved of, many debates and political consensus are required; but they might be very time consuming and likely to hold up a solution for the current European banking situation.",
        "Should the increased risk perception and the deterioration of the region’s consumer and investor confidence resulting from these recent facts be prolonged, they would negatively affect the eurozone dynamism already weakened, thus increasing the risk of a strong recession in an environment where their economies have little fiscal and monetary leeway space to confront it, apart from a fragile financial system.",
        "Although not information is still available for an assessment of the effect of these latest events on the manufacturing sector/industry worldwide if risk factor levels remain high, and this might erode confidence at world level with negative consequence on consumption, investment, credit, and global trade and commerce in general.",
        "In addition, if Greek exit form the eurozone materializes, the likelihood of a financial crisis leading to a new global recession may increase.",
        "Under this last scenario, the negative effects on the Colombian economic activity might be very strong AND Unanimously, the Board of Director deemed that maintaining the policy interest rate unaltered would be appropriate, considering the following factors: (i) In the external context, German economic growth in the first quarter more than offset GDP falls in the remaining countries.",
        "In the same period, both Japan and the United States to a lesser extent registered higher growths than projected.",
        "In the large emerging economies like China, Brazil and India, deceleration has been worse than expected; (ii) In May, uncertainty grew regarding the permanence of Greece in the eurozone.",
        "This added to other financial an political events in Europe rose international risk premiums, affected securities markets in a negative way, and weakened the currencies of the emerging economies, including the Colombian peso; (iii) The recent developments taking place in Europe increased the risks of a strong recession in this continent in an environment where their economies have little fiscal and monetary leeway space to confront it, and a fragile financial system.",
        "The growing likelihood of this scenario heightened the uncertainty of core growth forecast for Colombia; (iv) The international oil price was reduced below the expectations a month ago.",
        "Despite this fact, the terms of trade continue to be high and serve to bolster growth in national income; (v) In Colombia, economic growth in 2012 is expected to stand between 4% and 6%.",
        "Both private demand dynamism in terms of both household consumption and investment will continue to be the main source of this growth.",
        "However, information available throughout the year points out to more moderation in household consumption and investment in line with the growth forecast for the full year; (vi) The increase in the commercial loan portfolio has slowed down, as explained by lower dynamic in loans in foreign currency.",
        "The increase in household loans, particularly consumer credit, remains high.",
        "However, the quality of the latter has deteriorated; (vii) In April, annual inflation (3.43%) was slightly less than estimated and similar to the previous month’s record.",
        "Averages for the core inflation measurements and expectations rose slightly, although risks to inflation are moderate.",
        "Some co-directors highlighted the good performance of the Colombian economy, motivated by the dynamic behavior of household consumption, high confidence levels, capital inflow dynamism of foreign direct investment, the favorable terms of trade observed up to the present, and the dynamic performance of most production sectors.",
        "All of the foregoing helps think that with the current interest rate levels in our core scenario, the growth of the economy is close to its actual potential, and the inflation projections are attaining the 3% target.",
        "Nevertheless, they emphasized the high and growing degree of uncertainty confronted by the Colombian economy as a result of public debt problems and the weakness of the financial system in some of the eurozone economies.",
        "Should these risks materialize, they might affect in a considerable manner the prices of the major export product and confidence as well.",
        "Anyway, Banco de la Republica has the monetary policy framework required to face them, together with sufficient tools and resources to attend to liquidity needs in both local and foreign currency, as well as those that might occur in an international environment of financial turbulence.",
        "Additionally, co-directors insisted in the need to keep the careful monitoring of consumer credit that, despite having shown a slight moderation in the past few weeks, maintains a high annual real growth rate with respect to the real GDP growth.",
        "Finally, after having adhered to the decision of maintaining the reference interest rate unaltered, a co-director, said that, in his opinion, Europe has already slid into recession and contraction, excluding Germany.",
        "He believes that Spain and is a particularly hard case, and that China, India, and Brazil are decelerating more than expected.",
        "Although Colombian exports in dollars continue to increase, he proves that agricultural and industrial sales have lost dynamism while mining and energy exports are growing quite vigorously.",
        "In the domestic economic activity, he has seen deceleration signs and is concerned about the poor performance of the industry.",
        "Given that a good monetary policy depends of the authorities’ anticipation ability, he considers that if the current status quo is maintained, it would be necessary to undertake a monetary policy relaxation phase provided inflation and expectations continue to converge, even slowly, to the point of the target range.",
        "On its side, the Ministry of Finance estimated that, thanks to the good collection result and the good recent financing conditions, the National Government has sufficient liquid resources to finance its budget and, should it be desirable, to implement countercyclical fiscal policies According to the assessment of the current balance of these risks, the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the intervention interest rate unchanged.",
        "The new information shall permit to establish new monetary policy actions.",
        "The Board will continue to carefully watch over the international situation, inflation behavior and projections, and growth, as well as the active markets performance; and it restates that monetary policy will depend upon the new information available."

    "2008": [
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on May 23, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future were discussed, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The principal topics addressed during the meeting are summarized below Background Annual inflation was 5.73% in April, which is 20 b less than the rate in March.",
        "Annual inflation declined for the second month in a row, following the recent peak in February of this year (6.35%).",
        "The inflation slowdown in April is explained by the way food prices performed (7.82% in April as opposed to 8.61% in March), particularly perishable food prices.",
        "Processed food inflation (8.75%) was down as well, thanks to meat and meat substitutes.",
        "Non-food inflation was up to 4.74% in April, having been 4.67% the month before.",
        "This difference was due primarily to regulated prices, which registered annual increases of 7.7% by March and 8.10% by April.",
        "Several core inflation indicators rose and are above the inflation target.",
        "Annual non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which is usually a good indicator of demand-side pressure on inflation, declined from 5.1% in March to 5.05% in April.",
        "Less of an adjustment in banking services and the increase in rental inflation (4.65%) - after remaining stable at around 4.3% for several months - were important factors in this respect.",
        "The annual increase in prices for tradable goods, excluding food and regulated prices, was the same as the month before.",
        "Regulated price inflation went from 7.7% in March to 8.1% in April, mainly because of the increase in public utility rates (gas 9.8% and electricity 9.4%).",
        "The pace of PPI growth picked up by April, with annual inflation going from 3.4% a 3.8% Local Economic Growth Available figures on aggregate demand show the following: Imports of consumer durables were up by 13.7% in dollars and 1.7% in volume during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007, while imports of consumer non-durables rose 18.3% in dollars, but declined in volume (25.4%).",

        "The real lending rate approached its historic average (12.3% actual vs. 12.5% average), while the real fixed-term deposit rate (DTF) has reached it already (4.8%) Discussion and Policy Options The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: Continued price increases at a rate that exceeds the targets set by the Board of Directors; The considerable weight food brings to bear on prices in an international scenario marked by upward pressures; Uncertainty about how regulated prices will behave in the future, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine those rates; The major increase in production costs for companies in terms of raw materials and labor; Uncertainty about what is in store for the world economy and Colombia’s main export markets, particularly Venezuela; How recent peso revaluation has affected inflation and the outlook for growth in the tradable sectors; The course of inflation expectations, which are still above the targets set by the Board of Directors.",
        "The Board believes the intervention interest rate hikes instituted since April 2006 and the change in reserve requirements midway through 2007 have had an impact on lending and deposit rates, and have helped to slow the increase in loans and local demand, as they were intended to do.",
        "It also emphasized that available information shows more of a slowdown in the economy than was anticipated initially.",
        "Various demand and production indicators reflect a drift in that direction, particularly the figures on commerce and certain industrial sectors.",
        "However, imports of capital goods suggest that investment is still strong, and the results of the Consumer Opinion Survey show the confidence indicator remains high.",
        "The increase in exports is also a factor.",
        "The main points discussed by the Board centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence the inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility as a way to anchor inflation expectations, given the possible side-effects of international food and fuel prices; (iv) the advisability of adopting monetary policy measures in an atmosphere of rising international food and fuel prices; (v) a current account deficit that indicates local demand is growing faster than national production; (vi) the possibility that developments on the international scene, in a situation where there is a current account deficit, might lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate; (vii) the uncertainty created by international markets that are extremely volatile and how that volatility might affect the Colombian economy; (viii) the risk posed by the balance between growth and inflation in light of new figures that are now available; and (ix) the effects of appreciation in the exchange rate.",
        "Some Board members emphasized that inflation pressures persist worldwide and, given the forecasts for inflation in the coming months, inflation and expectations of inflation should be anchored in the targets.",
        "To accomplish this, they believe a monetary-policy stance that facilitates counter-cyclical monetary management in the future, given an eventual slowdown in the economy, is required.",
        "They pointed out that steering inflation towards its long-term target is crucial to avoiding a period of economic difficulties in the future and the reduction in growth with respect to local demand and credit relieves inflation pressures and allows the economy to grow at a sustainable pace.",
        "They emphasized that available figures show that industry and commerce, two sectors that are highly sensitive to internal demand, registered less growth during March than was forecast by Banco de la República and the latest surveys also suggest less growth in demand.",
        "In this respect, they believe more information is needed to identify the risk of inflation and the risk of less economic growth this year, and particularly in 2009, before making any change in monetary policy.",
        "Despite serious questions about how the world economy will perform, it was noted that the external context remains favorable for economic growth in Colombia, judging by the recent increase in terms of trade, exports and foreign direct investment.",
        "Finally, they indicated that, although there is a difference between interest rates in Colombia and the United States, appreciation of the peso is basically due to strong global pressure for dollar devaluation and to the trend in terms of trade and foreign direct investment.",
        "Other Board members believe the recent drift in economic indicators suggests the economic slowdown that began at the end of 2007 continues from the standpoint of both supply and demand, and is faster than anticipated initially, even discounting the effects of Easter Week and the Cerromatoso strike.",
        "In addition, there is the negative impact revaluation has had on certain sectors and on the amount of income available to households as a result of less income from remittances.",
        "They pointed out that Colombia, like other countries, is facing a supply shock to inflation, led by food prices and, therefore, questioned the advisability of maintaining a restrictive monetary policy.",
        "They indicated that the measures implemented by the Board have, and will continue to have the desired effect in terms of curbing the increase in loans, and there already has been a significant downward adjustment in inflation in prices for perishable foods and non- tradables, excluding food and regulated prices.",
        "The possible adverse effects of the US recession and the world crisis on economic growth in Colombia should be taken into account as well, apart from the serious concerns about the fate and sustainability of Venezuela’s economic development.",
        "Consequently, for these reasons, they proposed lowering the intervention interest rate by 25 basis points.",
        "This would help to reduce the spread between local and external interest rates and the added pressure for peso revaluation resulting from that difference.",
        "The rate of peso revaluation during the last five years has been one of the highest in the world Policy Decision The Board decided, by a majority vote, to leave the intervention rate at 9.75% and emphasized the importance of carefully monitoring the effect the international economic situation could have on growth, as well as the impact of inflationary pressure coming from international prices for food and fuel.",

        "Annual consumer inflation was 7.52% in June, having increased for the third month in a row.",
        "Accumulated inflation in the first five months of the year came to 6.5%.",
        "This figure is 181 basis points (bp) above what it was last year.",
        "Some of the core inflation indicators increased in June and remained above the target for inflation.",
        "The build-up in inflation during June was due to food prices, with rice and oils exerting the most upward pressure.",
        "Regulated price inflation went from 8.8% in June to 9.5% in July, mainly because of fuel and transportation.",
        "Tradable and non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, declined last month.",
        "In particular, the non-tradable CPI, excluding food and regulated prices, was 5.1% in July as opposed to 5.3% in June.",
        "The intermediate and long-term inflation expectations implicit in TES market performance declined in the wake of the Board meeting on July 25, which put an end to the upward tendency observed since April.",
        "In addition, intermediate and long-term rates on TES fell during the period between July 25 and August 12, by 59 bp and 90 bp, respectively.",
        "In July, producer inflation measured by the total PPI accelerated once again, going from 8% in June to 9.6%, which is the highest it has been since 2003.",
        "The available figures do not suggest changes in the GDP growth forecast developed by the Bank’s technical team for this year, which is between 3.3% and 5.3%, The information on industry for the last two months indicates the sector continues experience less momentum, even more than expected.",
        "According to the ANDI Combined Opinion Survey, the annual increase in industrial production for the year to June was 1.2%.",
        "This is less than it was in April and May (2.8% and 1.9%, respectively).",
        "The industrial confidence indicators and the extent of inventories and orders at June confirm these tendencies.",
        "The commerce indicators are not conclusive with respect to the tendencies in the sector.",
        "The balance of the Fenalco opinion surveys suggests that sales continued to loose momentum, although not as quickly as during the first quarter.",
        "On the other hand, the different Fedesarrollo indicators, such as the indicator of the current economic situation in the sector and the indicator of economic expectations at six months, denote no additional deterioration in the last two months.",
        "The latest figures show the strong momentum in exports continues, with an increase of 42.4% in dollars and 22.9% in non-traditional exports.",
        "The data on energy demand at June and July reflect an improvement, following the low figures in recent months.",
        "For example, the annual increase by July was 2.8%, which is more than the rate for the year to June (2.1%).",
        "Internal VAT collections showed nominal growth rates above two digits throughout the first six months of the year, having climbed to 35.7% in June.",
        "World inflation has accelerated in recent month as a result of high food and energy prices.",
        "At the same time, economic growth has slowed.",
        "This phenomenon has been more pronounced in Japan, England and the Euro Zone.",
        "Those economies have begun to feel the effect of high prices for raw materials and the slowdown in the United States.",
        "In the case of the United States, annual growth was 1.9% during the second quarter.",
        "However, this does not change the unfavorable outlook for this year and the next.",
        "Analysts have lowered their forecasts for U growth in 2008 and 2009.",
        "The consumer confidence and manufacturing production indexes in the Euro Zone have fallen sharply in recent months, weakening the GDP growth projections for 2008 and 2009.",
        "These indicators have been even less favorable in the case of Japan and the United Kingdom.",
        "The same has happened in some of the region’s emerging market economies, such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile and Mexico, which continue to experience a slowdown in growth.",
        "In that context, the dollar has gained strength against a large number of currencies.",
        "Coupled with the prospects of weaker world demand, this situation has led to a drop in prices for raw materials in recent weeks, especially oil prices.",
        "The annual increase in the principal monetary aggregates by July showed a declined during the last month and a half.",
        "For example, between June and July, M3 growth went from 14.5% to 11.5%.",
        "Deposits with the financial system continue, largely in the form of time certificates (CDTs).",
        "Growth in the peso loan portfolio in the financial system stayed at 19.4% in July, which is similar to the figure registered the month before.",
        "A look at how this aggregate has performed in recent months shows no signs of a slowdown.",
        "The restraint in retail loan portfolio growth (18.4% in July) continued to be offset by a build-up in the ordinary loan portfolio (20.4% in July) and, in the last three weeks, by added growth in the mortgage loan portfolio (16.5% in July).",
        "Most nominal interest rates declined during the past month.",
        "The largest drop was in rates on credit card loans (40 pb).",
        "The usury rate declined as well during the same period (by about 60 bp).",
        "The exchange rate devaluated by 4.2% between July 14 and August 14.",
        "The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: Continued price increases at rates that exceed the Bank’s targets, even though some items in the basket have begun to register lower price hikes (e the CPI, excluding food and regulated prices); Uncertainty about the future of international prices for food and oil, which declined in recent weeks, and the effect they might have on total inflation; Uncertainty about how regulated prices will behave, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine them, and doubts about non-tradable inflation; The major increase in production costs for companies; Uncertainty about prospects for the world economy and Colombia’s principal export markets, particularly Venezuela; The effect of the exchange rate on inflation, and the outlook for growth in the tradable sectors; and The behavior of inflation expectations, which continue to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors, despite a decline last month.",
        "The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence the inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the advisability of adopting monetary policy measures in a scenario of high international prices for food and fuel; (iv) the behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which was down in July compared to the month before; (v) the lower forecasts for the current account deficit; (vi) the effects of accumulated appreciation in the exchange rate and the devaluation observed during the last few weeks; (vii) the possibility that changes on the international scene, in a situation with a current account deficit, might lead to future exchange rate adjustments; (viii) the uncertainty created by highly volatile international markets and how that volatility might affect the Colombian economy; (ix) the difficulty in assessing available data in a situation marked by a break in the cycle of sustained growth; (x) the risk balance with respect to growth and inflation in a context of rising inflation expectations and economic slowdown; and (xi) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations, given the risk of the side-effects of international food and fuel prices.",
        "It was emphasized during the meeting that inflation continues to rise in many countries and a number of central banks have raised their interest rates.",
        "International prices for oil, food and other commodities fell recently, but are still at historically high levels.",
        "In Colombia, expectations of inflation at different horizons, measured by the market for domestic government bonds (TES), declined sharply after the Board of Directors agreed in July to raise the Bank’s intervention rate by 25 bp.",
        "The recent decline in long-term interest rates and the July reduction in non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, are important factors as well.",
        "Available figures show growth in local demand and output in Colombia has become more moderate, as it has in other countries; however, the forecast for growth is still between 3.3% and 5.3%.",
        "Tighter financial conditions and the effect of higher food and fuel prices on real available income have curbed the increase in demand.",
        "Supply has been negatively affected by higher production costs, which mean less growth in production and higher prices.",
        "It is to be expected that annual inflation in 2008 will remain high during the months ahead, due to high food and fuel prices.",
        "Afterwards, total inflation and the core inflation indicators may fall off gradually, provided inflation expectations continue to decline and wage increases are moderate.",
        "The monetary authority’s commitment to the long-term inflation targets encourages the conditions for sustained growth in output and employment.",
        "In view of the foregoing, the Board of Directors agreed unanimously to hold Banco de la República’s intervention interest rates steady, and believes it is important to continue to monitor the effect the international situation might have on growth, as well as the inflationary pressures associated with international food and fuel prices.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed unanimously to make no change in Banco de la República’s intervention interest rates.",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia on September 19, 2008 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia was held in the city of Bogotá on September 19, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Central Bank of Colombia Permanent Board Members: Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Juan Mario Laserna Mr. Leonardo Villar The situation and prospects for inflation and economic growth were discussed and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the most important topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in August was 7.87%, having increased for the fourth month in a row.",
        "Accumulated inflation in the first eight months of the year came to 6.74%.",
        "Annual core inflation averaged 5.1% and 5.8% for five and three indicators, respectively.",
        "These indicators declined slightly for the first time this year (six basis points in both cases).",
        "The build-up in inflation during August was due to food prices, with most of the upward pressure coming from vegetables, fruits, tubers and milk.",
        "Annual inflation in regulated prices was 9.4%, which is similar to what it was in August.",
        "Fuel prices and public utility rates continued to exert upward pressure in this category.",
        "Inflation in tradable goods rose from 2.1% in July to 2.3% in August.",
        "Non-tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, declined for the second month in a row, going from 5.1% inflation in July to 5% in August.",
        "This inflation basket item has accumulated a 60 bp decline during the past year, The various measurements of inflation expectations resulting from local government bonds (at 1, 5 and 10 years) continued to ease, although they remain well above the long-term target for inflation.",
        "Annual producer inflation, measured by the total PPI, declined from 9.6% in July to 9% in August Internal Growth The available information suggests the pace of growth in the Colombian economy has been less than expected.",
        "For the third quarter, the performance of industry and commerce (at July), as well as the business opinion surveys, confirm the slowdown in growth, particularly with respect to the industrial sectors that produce textiles, clothing and footwear, and vehicles and transport materials.",
        "The loss of momentum in these manufacturing areas coincides with a reduction in the volume of exports to Venezuela and the United States.",
        "On the job market, salaried employment is falling, while so-called “self- employment” continues to grow at a good pace The External Context The international financial crisis worsened in September, predominantly in the United States.",
        "The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and fears that other financial institutions might meet a similar fate added to the uncertainty on financial markets.",
        "These events caused stock market indexes around the world to drop and led to a shift in the composition of investment portfolios towards safer securities, such as short-term US Treasury Bonds.",
        "This, in turn, strengthened the dollar against most currencies.",
        "Prospects for growth in the developed countries have deteriorated, as they have in some Latin American economies.",
        "However, growth rates are still high in countries such as Peru, Brazil and Venezuela.",
        "The information at hand suggests that inflation in the developed countries and in some emerging economies like China might be starting to give way.",
        "This has prompted the central banks of many countries to interrupt the interest rate hikes witnessed in past months.",
        "As to the emerging economies, the financial crisis has limited access to credit and made it more expensive.",
        "Moreover, the drop in most international commodity prices should contribute to the decline in inflation within the region.",
        "However, it also affects terms of trade, especially for oil exporting countries such as Colombia and its major trading partners in the region Financial Variables Annual growth in the primary monetary aggregates accelerated during the past month.",
        "For example, the increase in M3 went from 11.5% to 16.3% between July and August.",
        "In August, the peso loan portfolio in the financial system maintained a growth rate of 19%, which is similar to what it was in July.",
        "The way this aggregate has behaved in recent months denotes no sign of a slowdown.",
        "The more moderate increase in the retail loan portfolio (16.8% growth in August) continues to be offset by the momentum in the commercial loan portfolio (21.4% in August).",
        "The mortgage loan portfolio has expanded by around 15.8% in the last three months.",
        "Interest rates on lending were up, as they were for ordinary and mortgage loans, while those for retail loans declined slightly.",
        "In real terms, the average loan rates calculated by the Central Bank of Colombia and the DTF were close to their historic averages calculated since 1986.",
        "As a result of the uncertainty on international markets, the exchange rate has devaluated 15.4% since the Board of Directors held its last meeting.",
        "The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: The pace of price hikes still exceeds the targets set by the Board of Directors.",
        "Some inflation basket items continue to show lower price increases.",
        "The CPI, excluding food and regulated prices, is a case in point.",
        "The downward trend in international prices for food, raw materials and oil continues and could have a major impact on total inflation.",
        "Core inflation indicators were down slightly for the first time during the course of 2008.",
        "There is uncertainty about how regulated prices will behave in the future, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine rates and non-tradable inflation.",
        "There have been major increases in production costs for companies, although the pace of PPI growth declined last month.",
        "There is uncertainty about how the world economy and Colombia’s principal export markets, particularly Venezuela, will perform in the future.",
        "The impact of peso revaluation on inflation and prospects for growth in the tradable sectors.",
        "Inflation expectations continue to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors, but declined last month.",
        "The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which was down in August for the second month in a row; (iv) the forecasts for the current account deficit; (v) the effects of exchange rate volatility and the devaluation observed in recent weeks; (vi) the possibility that international developments, in a situation with a current account deficit, might lead to future exchange rate adjustments; (vii) the uncertainty generated by the world financial crisis on international markets and the effect it could have on the Colombian economy; (viii) the difficulty in assessing the data on hand in a situation where there is a break in the growth cycle; (ix) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context of rising inflation expectations and economic slowdown; and (x) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations, given the possible side-effects of international food and fuel prices.",
        "The Board members highlighted the virtues of the monetary policy decisions adopted as of April 2006 to eliminate surplus demand and credit in the economy, to control the influx of foreign speculative capital, to strengthen the balance of international reserves, and to mitigate the effects of higher international commodity prices on inflation expectations.",
        "It also was emphasized that the information on hand indicates that economic growth in Colombia and in a most countries has been less than expected.",
        "The international financial crisis worsened during the past month, affecting the prices of certain assets in Colombia, particularly the peso exchange rate against the dollar, which has been extremely volatile of late.",
        "There is every indication that the uncertainty will continue, and the exact impact on world economic growth and the availability of resources for the emerging economies is unknown.",
        "Finally, it was noted that the inflation forecasts presented in the June 2008 edition of the Inflation Report, which indicate this variable is likely to decline as of the fourth quarter of the year, will probably be reinforced by the new data on international prices and food.",
        "However, several Board members indicated this does not mean the stance of the country’s monetary policy should be revised with intervention interest rate cuts, at least for now.",
        "This is because of two factors.",
        "On the one hand, the relative price shock has made inflation one of the primary causes of the economic slowdown, given its impact on available household income and costs for companies.",
        "On the other hand, although some inflationary pressures have declined recently, there are still elements out there that add to the risk of higher increases in the general level of prices.",
        "These include inflation expectations, which remain high, the uncertainty about how the exchange rate will behave and its impact on prices, and the outlook for the wage hikes that are scheduled to be decided in the coming months.",
        "Under these circumstances and with the information that is available, one cannot expect higher inflation to result in more growth.",
        "On the contrary, it is likely to delay the recovery in growth.",
        "The members also felt the monetary authority’s commitment to the long-term targets for inflation contributes to the conditions required for sustained growth in production and employment.",
        "Given the current situation, it was indicated that a premature change in monetary policy could actually increase expectations of inflation.",
        "This would raise intermediate and long-term interest rates, which would have a negative effect on economic activity, and would reduce the capacity of monetary policy to act in an anti-cyclical way in the future.",
        "Another position within the Board is that, given the drop in non-tradable inflation excluding food and regulated prices, the decline in the average of the core inflation indicators, the sharp and more-than-expected slowdown in growth since the onset of efforts to tighten monetary policy, the more than 8% reduction in salaried employment during the three months between May and July, the decline in the business climate and in the business community’s inclination to invest, as indicated in the latest survey done by the Central Bank, the effects of the international financial crisis on Colombia and its major trading partners, and considering that monetary policy must look ahead on a timeline of no less than 18 months to two years, the best approach is to begin normalizing monetary policy here and now, with a 25 basis point reduction in the Bank’s intervention interest rate, so as not to be forced to make abrupt cutbacks of an unusual scale in the future.",
        "Finally, it was noted that the international financial situation will have to be monitored and the necessary monetary policy measures will have to be adopted, in due course, to deal with its effects The Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, not to change the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on April 25, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future were discussed, and decisions on monetary policy were reached.",
        "The principal issues addressed during the meeting are summarized below Background Annual inflation was 5.93% in March.",
        "This figure is 42 b less than the one in February and comes after five months of consecutive increases.",
        "The inflation slowdown in March is explained by the behavior of food prices (8.6% inflation in March as opposed to 10.5% in February), particularly perishables.",
        "Even so, annual inflation in this sub-group remains high (9.6%).",
        "Non-food inflation was 4.67% as opposed to 4.47% the month before, primarily due to regulated prices, which registered annual increases of 6.57% in February and 7.7% in March.",
        "Several core inflation indicators rose, after being stable for four months.",
        "Annual non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which is usually a good indicator of demand side pressure on inflation, declined from 5.3% in February to 5.1% in March.",
        "Less of an adjustment in banking services and stability in annual rental inflation were important factors in this respect.",
        "The latter has been around 4.3% during the last four months.",
        "Despite a steep drop in the exchange rate for the peso with respect to the dollar, prices for tradable goods, excluding food and regulated prices, registered more of an increase than during the previous month.",
        "The pace of PPI growth had eased slightly by March and registered 3.4% annual inflation Local Economic Growth The increase in GDP during 2007 (7.52%) and the last quarter of the year (8.14%) was more than expected, confirming that growth in the Colombian economy remains robust.",
        "In fact, the growth rate for 2007 is one of the highest witnessed in the last 50 years.",
        "Investment and household consumption were the demand components that contributed the most to economic growth during 2007.",
        "From a sector perspective, the biggest increases were in construction, transport, the manufacturing industry and commerce.",
        "The fourth-quarter figures for 2007 confirm the strong momentum in exports, with 9.2% real growth compared to 7.7% during the previous quarter.",
        "The increase for the entire year (2007) was 7.5%.",
        "The first-quarter average for the consumer confidence index remained high and growth rates for merchandise exports during the early months of the year were higher than at the end of 2007.",
        "The sharp rise in imports of capital goods suggests that private investment is still going strong.",
        "Average annual appreciation in the exchange rate during the first quarter of the year was 14%, primarily as a result of foreign direct investment in the petroleum and mining sectors.",
        "The figures released by DANE and the sector surveys done in January show employment continued to grow at a brisk pace The International Situation The slowdown in the US economy continued.",
        "Indicators that reflect the service sector and industry, consumers’ perception of their economic situation, retail sales (real) by March and job creation have been negative.",
        "Accordingly, international analysts anticipate a decline in US output during the first half of the year.",
        "Low growth rates are expected to continue throughout remainder of 2008 and in 2009.",
        "The housing market continued to slip in recent months.",
        "Building permits and new home construction continued to decline and inventories (at February) are still quite high.",
        "Downward pressure on home prices is likely to persist.",
        "All of this is making it difficult for people to pay their mortgages and has increased the number of foreclosures.",
        "Payment arrears have increased as well; they are more pronounced among loans made recently and are not necessarily confined to the sub-prime portfolio.",
        "This news has affected the financial system.",
        "The doubts about its soundness continue, particularly in light of the huge losses incurred by a number of international banks Financial Variables The slowdown in monetary aggregates as of November 2007 continued.",
        "The annual increase in M3 was 15.2%, cash 9.8% and liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR) 16.05%.",
        "The shift in deposits towards CDs persisted throughout the month.",
        "Loan portfolio growth in the financial system continued to slow.",
        "By March, peso loans were up by 21.9% compared to 24.6% in December 2007.",
        "The retail loan portfolio is the segment that has declined the most in recent months, having grown by 26.1% compared to 32.6% in December.",
        "Nominal lending and deposit rates were up during March, with the exception of interest on retail and mortgage loans, which declined slightly.",
        "The DTF rate was 9.6%, having been 9.3% in February and 9.0% in December.",
        "It is now at the same level as the TIB, after two years of being below that rate.",
        "The average lending rate was 16.9%, as opposed to 16.6% in February and December.",
        "The increase in real rates has been tempered by rising inflation throughout the year.",
        "The average real lending rate (11.7%) is between the average calculated since 1986 (12.5%) and the average calculated as of 2001 (9.8%) Discussion and Policy Options The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: Continued price increases at a rate that exceeds the targets set by the Board of Directors; The weight food exerts on price performance in an international scenario marked by upward pressures; Uncertainty about the future of regulated prices, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine them; The substantial increase in production costs for companies in terms of raw materials and labor; Available indicators that suggest the momentum in aggregate demand remains high compared to production; Uncertainty about the future of the world economy and Colombia’s main export markets, particularly Venezuela; The impact of recent peso revaluation on inflation and prospects for growth in the tradable sectors; The trend in inflation expectations, which continue to surpass the Board’s targets.",
        "The Board believes the intervention interest rate hikes since April 2006 and the change in reserve requirements midway through 2007 have had an impact on lending and deposit interest rates, and have been effective in slowing credit growth.",
        "However, local demand continues to increase at a rate that exceeds the expansion in national production.",
        "The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the need to enhance the monetary authority’s credibility as a way to anchor inflation expectations, given the possible side-effects of international food and fuel prices; (iv) the suitability of adopting monetary policy measures in an atmosphere of rising international food and fuel prices; (v) a current account deficit that indicates local demand is growing faster than national production; (vi) the possibility that developments on the international scene, in a context marked by a current account deficit, might lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate; (vi) the uncertainty sparked by extremely volatile international markets and how that volatility might affect the Colombian economy; and (vii) the effects of exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Several Board members noted there are inflation pressures worldwide and many central banks have adopted a more restrictive stance.",
        "Given the forecasts for inflation in the months ahead, they believe inflation and expectations of inflation should be anchored to the targets and monetary policy should stay restrictive.",
        "This would facilitate anti-cyclical monetary management if there is a slowdown in the economy, helping it to achieve maximum sustainable growth.",
        "They pointed out that available figures show there continues to be surplus demand in the economy and there are inflation risks that might force future hikes in the intervention interest rate.",
        "Judging by the recent increase in terms of trade, exports and foreign direct investment, the external context is still favorable for economic growth in Colombia, despite a great deal of uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy.",
        "Although there is a difference between interest rates in Colombia and the United States, it was suggested that appreciation of the peso is fundamentally the result of strong global pressure on a weakening dollar, coupled with the trend in terms of trade and foreign direct investment.",
        "Other Board members felt that, barring serious unforeseen shocks, further increases in the intervention interest rate will not be necessary, because the monetary-policy measures adopted so far have achieved their purpose and will continue to do so in terms of curbing local demand and slowing the economy.",
        "Added to this is the major downward adjustment in perishable food and non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, and the possible adverse effects the US recession and the world crisis might have on Colombia’s economic growth, apart from the uncertainty surrounding the fate and sustainability of developments in the Venezuelan economy.",
        "For these reasons, they insisted on the need for near-term efforts to normalize the country’s monetary policy.",
        "Doing so would help to halt the growing spread between local and external interest rates and the resulting additional pressure for revaluation of the peso.",
        "The peso revaluation rate in the last five years has been one of the highest in the world.",
        "In view of these factors, the Board decided to hold the intervention rate at 9.75% and to monitor the international economic situation in terms of its possible impact on growth, as well as the affect of international food and fuel prices on inflation.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed to leave Banco de la República’s benchmark interest rate at 9.75%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on March 28, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Inflation and economic growth, and their prospects for the future were discussed, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the principal issues addressed during the meeting Background Annual inflation was 6.35% at the end of February, which represents an increase for the fifth month in a row.",
        "This figure is 35 b above the annual rate of inflation at the end of January and 185 b over the target range for 2008.",
        "Food prices were essentially responsible for the increase in inflation in February.",
        "During that month, non-food inflation remained stable at 4.47% and several core inflation indicators declined slightly.",
        "Annual non tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, stayed at around 5.2%.",
        "Food inflation went from 9.4% in January to 10.5% in February.",
        "The increase was due to perishables, particularly potato prices.",
        "Processed-food inflation was at about the same level registered in January.",
        "Even so, annual inflation in that sub-group remains high (9.5%).",
        "Annual PPI inflation continued to climb and was 3.9% by February, while the wage indicators in every sector for which information is available showed a good deal of acceleration Local Economic Growth The increase in GDP during 2007 (7.52%) and the last quarter of the year (8.14%) was more than expected and confirms that growth in the Colombian economy remains strong.",
        "Exports in dollars rose sharply during November and particularly in December.",
        "Both traditional and non-traditional exports performed well, thanks to better export prices and more export volume.",
        "Sales to Venezuela registered a cumulative increase of more than 90% during the 12 months up to December.",
        "Traditional exports to the United States picked up during the final months of 2007, and the decline in non-traditional exports came to a halt.",
        "According to DANE, industrial growth was 5.6% in January.",
        "However, the figures reported by ANDI indicate it was 7.5%.",
        "Retail sales dropped as a result of food sales.",
        "Other indicators of private spending, such as consumer sentiment measured by Fedesarrollo, suggest it remains high.",
        "Import growth gained speed during January compared to December, particularly imports of consumer durables and capital goods.",
        "The figures released by DANE and the sector surveys done in January show employment continued to increase at a brisk pace The International Situation Economic activity in the United States continued to slow.",
        "A variety of indicators in February and March suggest it entered in negative terrain during the first quarter of 2008.",
        "By March, consumer sentiment was similar to what it was during last recession in 2001-2002, or even lower.",
        "This was reflected in poor retail sales performance and a drop in industrial production.",
        "On the other hand, the real estate crisis continues.",
        "According to the information at hand in December, home prices continue to fall, inventories have yet to decline, and mortgage defaults and home foreclosures are on the rise.",
        "This news has affected the financial system, and there are growing concerns about its soundness.",
        "These doubts are confirmed by the difficult situation facing a number of international banks.",
        "All of this seems to indicate the recession in the United States will be more pronounced and longer than initially expected.",
        "Analysts have lowered their forecasts for growth in 2008 from 1.5% to around 0.5%.",
        "The growth rates forecast for 2009 are below 1%.",
        "If these predictions are born out, the performance of the US economy would slow to its lowest point in the last two decades, which would affect world economic growth.",
        "For this reason, the economic forecasts for other developed economies have been revised downward as well.",
        "Prices for raw material have been extremely volatile as a result of the growing uncertainty in the United States.",
        "It is not clear to what extent today’s high prices are due to surplus world demand or to speculation associated with the weak dollar.",
        "This last factor raises the risk of changes sparked by more pronounced reductions than those witnessed in recent months.",
        "The emerging economies, particularly in Latin America, continued to see their currencies appreciate.",
        "On the other hand, in recent weeks, the reaction of their country risk premiums to the worsening international situation has been relatively moderate Financial Variables Monetary aggregates experienced another slowdown in February.",
        "The annual increase in M3 was 16.9%, cash 11.3% and liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR) 17.8%.",
        "The build-up in deposits through CDs continued all the way through February.",
        "The slowdown in loan portfolio growth in the financial system continued.",
        "The annual increase in total credit was 23.1% compared to 24.6% in December.",
        "An analysis of the marginal increase, using a series of 13-order moving averages, shows the slowdown was more pronounced in the last few months, particularly in retail and commercial loans.",
        "Nominal interest rates continued to rise and the various real rates on lending and deposits are at their historic averages Discussion and Policy Options The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: The rate of price increases, which continues to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors The considerable amount of pressure food prices are exerting on inflation in an international scenario marked by upward pressures The behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which halted the downward trend witnessed in previous months Available indicators suggesting the momentum in aggregate demand remains high compared to production, but is showing signs of moderation Uncertainty about the future of the world economy and the future of Colombia’s principal export markets, particularly Venezuela The impact of recent peso revaluation on inflation and prospects for growth in the tradable sectors The development of inflationary expectations, which continue to climb and now exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors and could be reflected in wage negotiations.",
        "The Board believes a number of indicators show the benchmark interest rate hikes and the change in reserve requirements have had an impact on loan and deposit interest rates, and have helped to reduce the increase in credit.",
        "Although the pace of growth in local demand has slowed, it still exceeds the increase in national production.",
        "The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the suitability of adopting monetary policy measures in a context of rising international food and fuel prices (iv) the current account deficit, which indicates that local demand is growing faster than national production; (v) the fact that international developments, in a situation where there is a current account deficit, might lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate; (vi) the uncertainty sparked by extremely volatile international markets and how that volatility could affect the Colombian economy; and (vii) the importance of the monetary authority enhancing its credibility as a way to anchor inflationary expectations, given the rising prices countries face.",
        "The majority of the Board members felt it was best not to change the benchmark rate, despite persistence of the inflationary pressures summarized earlier, particularly the increase in expectations of inflation among agents in the economy.",
        "The idea is to acquire additional information to assess the possible effects of a more prolonged and profound recession in the United States, as well as the impact of the monetary-policy measures adopted in the past.",
        "Several Board members noted the importance of having inflation targets to anchor inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "For that reason, they believe it is necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy that will facilitate an anti-cyclical monetary policy in the future.",
        "This is despite the prospect of less economic growth, particularly due to the impact of the recession in the United States.",
        "One Board member said the benchmark rate should be lowered for the following reasons.",
        "(i) The monetary-policy measures adopted by the Board have achieved the desired effect and will continue to do so.",
        "There already are several signs of this, such as less utilization of industrial installed capacity, the drop in the industrial confidence index, the slowdown in the demand for energy, durable consumer goods and housing, higher interest rates, the downward trend in the demand for household loans and the drop in the loan portfolio, particularly with respect to retail loans.",
        "(ii) The figures at hand suggest there will be a major adjustment in perishable food prices on the local market in the next few months.",
        "(iii) The momentum in the Colombian economy during 2008 and 2009 will be affected by the slowdown in US and world economic growth, and by possible future problems affecting Venezuela.",
        "(iv) A reduction in the benchmark rate would halt the growing spread between internal and external rates and would mean less pressure for revaluation of the peso.",
        "The extent of peso revaluation has been among the highest in the world during the last five years and can cause serious problems for the tradable sectors and job creation.",
        "In view of the foregoing, the Board decided, by a majority vote, to hold the benchmark rate at 9.75% and to carefully monitor the impact the international economic situation could have on growth, as well as the effect of inflationary pressures caused by international food and fuel prices Policy Decision The Board of Directors agreed, by a majority vote, to leave Banco de la República’s benchmark interest rate at 9.75%.",
        "The ordinary meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in The annual consumer inflation was of 7.18% in June, 79 bp above the one observed in May.",
        "The accumulated inflation in the course of the first six months of the year rose to 6%.",
        "Some of the indicators for basic inflation increased in June, and remain over the inflation goal.",
        "The acceleration of inflation during the month of June is explained by the behavior of the prices of food products (12% increase in June vs7% in May), especially that of potato and rice.",
        "Other supplies, perishable as well as processed, continue to present yearly adjustments of very high and increasing prices.",
        "The yearly inflation not including food products was of 4.9%, lightly superior to the 4.8% of May.",
        "Inflation pertaining to sub-groups of tradable and non tradable goods not including food nor regulated products remained stable as compared to May.",
        "The inflation of the group of regulated products increased from 8.3% in May to 8.8% in June as a result of increases in the rates for electricity and gas and in the prices of fuels.",
        "The expectations of inflation in one, five, and ten years, as measured by the polls addressed to analysts and by the prices of the titles of internal debt, increased to over 5.5%.",
        "The annual increase in the index of growth of the PPI rose from 5.4% in May to 8% Internal growth The information available on the behavior of production, aggregate demand, and income, reveals the following: DANE revealed the growth in production for 2007 based on the new base 2000.",
        "According to this information, Colombian economy (excluding illegal crops) expanded at a rhythm of 8.2% in 2007, not 7.6% as had been initially indicated.",
        "The greatest growth rate took place during the first trimester (9.1%), but the fourth trimester also presented a very high yearly variation (8.4%).",
        "With the new base, 2007 has been the year of greatest expansion in economic activity in the last five decades.",
        "The figures of DANE for the growth of the GNP during the first trimester register 4.1%.",
        "The downturn of growth was the result of diverse factors, regarding supply as well as demand, some of them punctual.",
        "The most important corresponds to the direct impact of the decrease in works, as has been pointed out before, probably obeying to changes in local and regional public administrations.",
        "A second factor was the lower number of working days in the trimester, given that the Easter holiday was in March.",
        "The strike in Cerromatoso as well as the reduction in the exportations of automobiles to Venezuela also affected the growth of GNP importantly.",
        "Colombian economy, as well as economy worldwide, has been facing an important increase in the costs of production and transportation during the last trimesters as a consequence of the strong increase in the prices of oil as well as of some raw materials.",
        "These circumstances affect the product negatively and raise the prices.",
        "Considering demand, the increase in the prices of fuels and of food products affect the real available income for households, slowing down present and future consumption, the latter especially given the consumers’ loss of confidence.",
        "The figures of DANE reveal that the net formation of capital was the component that registered a greater deceleration, associated more to the fall of investment in works carried out by the public sector than with a deterioration of private investment.",
        "Household consumption also slowed down, turning from a 5.6% growth in the fourth trimester of 2007 to 3.9% in the first trimester of 2008.",
        "According to the new series (base 2000), consumption would have begun to slow down since the second trimester of 2007, contrasting previous information, which not reveal an important slowdown during last year.",
        "Total exports increased 15% in real pesos in the beginning of the year.",
        "This expansion took place in spite of the appreciation of the type of exchange and obeys to the strong demand from Venezuela of manufactured products and food products as well as to the increase in the production of mining products such as coal.",
        "The final domestic demand grew at an annual rhythm of 5.4% during the first trimester, which implied a slowdown against what was observed in 2007, yet still over the historic average.",
        "On the other side, the annual growth of the aggregated demand to March was 6.7%, facing 11.1% of the fourth trimester of 2007 and 10.3% in all of last year.",
        "The behavior of the indicators of industrial production, of retail commercial sales, and of consumer confidence to May, once again suggests a smaller growth in the second trimester than the one observed in 2007.",
        "All these circumstances led to a reduction by the technical team at Banco de la República in the projection of growth for 2008 to a range of 3.3% to 5.3%, versus the previous one, which stood between 4.0% and 6.0%.",
        "The salary indicators available do not show a homogeneous tendency by sectors.",
        "While the average salaries in heavy construction accelerated until June, registering high readjustments, the annual growth in the salaries of the industry and commerce remained stable around the rates of 5.3% and 7.5% respectively Foreign context Employment in the USA continued falling during the last months, revealing that the productive activity is weakened.",
        "Simultaneously, the housing sector does not show any signals of recovery and, on the contrary, its situation could deteriorate still more.",
        "As a result of the increase in arrears of mortgage credit and seizure of housing, the prices of housing continued to reduce in April and could continue doing so in the following trimesters.",
        "Although some improvement was observed in the financial conditions in the USA during the second trimester, this trend was not maintained in the last few weeks.",
        "The mortgage crisis continued to strike financial institutions, this time affecting the two major entities backed by the government which cover the sector of housing credits (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).",
        "Because of these problems, new liquidity pressures have arisen once again in the inter-banking market of this country, as has been registered by the increase in the differential between the cost of indebtedness by the Treasury and that of commercial banks.",
        "Similarly, meaningful reductions in the stock indexes have taken place, given that they are not only circumscribed to financial companies, but they also extend to those of the real sector (excluding energy companies).",
        "Growth has also lost momentum outside the USA, Europe being the most evident case, where an important deterioration can be observed in consumers’ confidence and company owners.",
        "Some emerging countries of Latin America such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile and Mexico also presented a slowdown of growth in the first trimester.",
        "In spite of this, the growth rate for the region as a whole continues to be relatively high.",
        "Particularly for Venezuela, the growth rate in the first trimester was 4.8%, lower than the one observed for 2007 (8.5%).",
        "The domestic demand lost momentum because of a strong deceleration of consumption and private investment.",
        "In spite of the lower dynamism of the worldwide economy, the international prices of basic products, particularly oil, continued to be high, which caused inflation to continue rising around the world.",
        "Particularly in the USA, total inflation for consumers continued to increase, and as of June it was 5% above analysts’ expectations.",
        "It is expected that the prices of basic products will remain high.",
        "Although speculation may take place, it is probable that fundamental factors related to the balance of demand and supply may explain the boom of these prices.",
        "In these conditions, a meaningful drawback in the prices of raw materials and oil may be possible only if a strong slowdown on world demand takes place, beyond the one foreseen by the market.",
        "Inflation increases as well as increments of inflation expectations took place not only in the USA, but also in a number of emerging and developing economies, the most important case being the one of the Euro zone.",
        "This situation has led to increases in interest rates or announcements of possible increases in the future issued by a number of central banks, notwithstanding that perspectives of growth have diminished Financial Variables The growth of broader monetary aggregates has become stable in the last trimester on levels higher to the growth of nominal GNP estimated for the present year.",
        "By the second week of July, the M3 grew at an annual rate of 12.5% and the liabilities under statutory reserve requirements increased by 13.3%.",
        "A re-composition of liabilities in favor of Certificates of Deposit continues to be observed.",
        "The debt portfolio of the financial system has been growing this year at an annual rate close to 18.9% versus 20% in the previous month.",
        "Debt portfolio in pesos continues to show greater dynamism, although it has presented a trend towards slowdown for almost a year.",
        "The net debt portfolio in national currency continued to slow down, although at a slower rhythm.",
        "Until June, this variable grew 18.9%, while one month before it had grown 20%.",
        "The greatest descent in the annual growth rate continues to be registered by the consumer debt portfolio (including micro-credit) with twelve-month variations of 20.6%, followed by commercial at 19.7% and mortgage on 16.1%.",
        "Different measures of the trends of debt portfolio suggest that by the end of the year its growth will be around 18%.",
        "The nominal average rates for lending (9.7%- in Colombia, DTF) and deposit rates (17.1% - BR methodology) increased slightly in June.",
        "These levels are similar to those registered last April.",
        "In real terms, the average rate for credit has experienced a decreasing behavior since October 2007, interrupted only in April this year, and its current level is below the historic average calculated since 1986.",
        "This last behavior is explained by the descent in the real rate for ordinary credits, and, in a lower measure, by the lower interest rate for consumption.",
        "The average appreciation from January to June this year regarding the same period last year was 13.5% Discussion and policy options In the course of the discussion the following issues were highlighted: (i) the rhythm of price growth continues over the goals established by the Board; (ii) the meaningful weight of food products over the behavior of prices in the international context of rising pressures; (iii) the uncertainty over the future behavior of the prices of regulated products, given the mechanisms for indexation incorporated in the determination of rates and the inflation of non- tradable goods; (iv) the costs of production of companies which present important increases in raw materials as well as in labor components; (v) uncertainty over the future behavior of world economy and of our main markets for exportation, particularly Venezuela’s; (vi) the effect of the revaluation of Colombian Peso over inflation and the perspectives of growth of the tradable sectors; (vii) the behavior of the expectations for inflation, which continue to be over the goals established by the Board, and (viii) the strong impact of the fall of investment on works on the growth of the GNP in the first trimester and the uncertainty of its possible effects on future growth.",
        "The main issues for discussion among the members of the Board were related to the following aspects: (i) the effect of the measures of monetary policy given the lag in their impact; (ii) the elements which affect the projections of inflation for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the negative projections of inflation in the short term; (iv) the pertinence of adopting measures of monetary policy in a context of increase in the international prices of food products and fuels; (v) the behavior of inflation of non-tradable goods not including food or regulated products, which continues to show a trend of increase; (vi) the lower deficit projections of the current account; (vii) the effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate; (viii) the possibility that the changes in the international scenario, in a context of deficit of the current account, may lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate: (ix) the uncertainty generated by the high volatility of the international markets and the incidence it may have on Colombian economy; (x) the difficulty to evaluate the information available in a situation in which there is a rupture in the sustained cycle of growth; (xi) the balance of risk between growth and inflation in a context of expectations of increasing inflation and slowdown of the economy (xii) the need of strengthening the credibility of the monetary authority and anchor expectations of inflation before the risk of collateral effects of the international prices of food products and fuels.",
        "The majority of the Board considered that the current situation is particularly delicate and requires an analysis with an explicit medium and long term perspective.",
        "Although the economy presents clear signals of deceleration and the risk balance indicates that growth this year will be less than in recent years, the risks of an inflation that may endanger growth in the medium term are considerable.",
        "Contrary to what was observed in 2007, during the first semester of 2008 the economy has fully received the impact of the clash of prices for food products, fuels, and metals which has been affecting world economy, in addition to the impact of local climatic factors.",
        "In fact, the diagnosis of the reasons explaining the slow-down of economy shows that the high levels of inflation, given their relation to these relative clashes in prices, are generating pressures of costs that negatively affect the supply in several productive sectors, among them the manufacturing industry.",
        "Additionally, inflation of food and regulated products has eroded the purchasing capacity of consumers of products other than basic goods.",
        "Based on the aforesaid, it can be stated that the nature of inflation significantly explains the recent decrease of economic growth.",
        "On the other hand, the expectations of inflation on a short, medium and long term have increased, constituting a serious obstacle for the purposes of the monetary authority and the greater effectiveness of the policy decisions adopted and to be adopted in the future.",
        "This is particularly dangerous in times when the measures for the propagation of inflation reach values close to 70%, indicating that the greater inflation of food and regulated goods has already contaminated part of the basic goods, and when the recent increases in the interest rates of intervention have been absorbed by the greatest inflation registered this year, even though it partly reflects transitory increases in prices.",
        "It is necessary then to avoid that the monetary policy validates the clashes of relative temporary prices causing them to turn into a greater inflation of permanent nature, carrying enormous economic and social costs.",
        "From the aforesaid it can be inferred that at the time there really is no disjunction between inflation and growth.",
        "The dilemma for the monetary authority lies in looking for a greater dynamics of economy in the very short term, probably temporary and which will be eroded by an overflowing inflation, or, on the other hand, consolidating the conditions for a sustained growth of production and employment, returning to a sensible path of inflation towards long-term goals.",
        "In order to do so, it is necessary to increase the rates of intervention of the Bank.",
        "Some members of the Directive Board advised that at this moment an additional increase on the interest rates would be inconvenient and untimely, given the following reasons: (i) the recent evolution of the economic indicators confirms that the economy is slowing down since the end of the previous year in a much faster way than the economic authorities had foreseen.",
        "The very same technical team at the Banco de la República has been forced to reduce its forecasts on the growth of economy for 2008, first from an annual 5,2% to 4,7%, and, according to its latest exercise, from 4,7% to 4,3%.",
        "(ii) Colombia, as well as other countries, is facing a clash of supply over inflation given the increase of the prices of food products.",
        "In the region, Colombia registers a relatively moderate increase of the total and basic inflation.",
        "The change of posture in the monetary policy since the beginning of 2006 and the additional measures for the control of inflation have allowed such posture not to have been eroded in real terms on account of the increase in the rate of inflation.",
        "(iii) The government announced a budget cut for 2008 of Col$1.5 trillion, which is equivalent to 0.4% of the GNP and one of whose fundamental objectives is to alleviate the pressure over the monetary policy derived from the increase of inflation.",
        "This measure adjusts the fiscal accounts and has an important effect over the growth of the public demand and economic growth in general and, therefore, over the behavior of inflation.",
        "(iv) It must be stressed that the monetary policy adopted by the Board since April 2006 has proved on account of its results that it has moved in the right direction.",
        "Besides, it must not be forgotten that more than half of the 15 increases in the interest rate of intervention of the Banco de la República took place less than one year and a half ago, which indicates that, due to the natural lag existing between these measures and their impact on domestic demand and credit, there is still a highly considerable number of remaining effects which have not yet been felt, and (v) An additional increase in the interest rate would broaden yet more the meaningful differential existing between the internal and external rates, and would therefore would increase the pressure on the revaluation of the Peso and the subsequent harm on employment in the tradable sectors of economy.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed by majority to increase the interest rates of intervention of Banco de la República in 25 bp, and deemed necessary to continue performing a careful follow-up of the effect that the international economic situation may have over growth, as well as of the inflationary pressures of the international prices of food products and fuels Policy decision-making The Board of Directors agreed by majority to increase the interest rates of intervention of Banco de la República in 25 bp, from 9.75% to 10%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on January 25, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor of Banco de la República Full-time Associate Directors: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Juan Mario Laserna Mr. Leonardo Villar Mr. Fernando Tenjo was not present.",
        "The situation with respect to inflation, economic growth and prospects for the future was discussed, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the major issues addressed during the meeting.",
        "Consumer inflation ended the year at 5.69%.",
        "This is 119 b above the top of the target range set by the Board of Directors of Banco de la República and 121 b more than the figure registered in December 2006.",
        "The rise in inflation during December was due essentially to the behavior of food and regulated prices.",
        "Annual inflation in non-tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, saw no increase that month and was 5.2%, having declined for the fourth month in a row after reaching a high of 5.57% in August.",
        "The core inflation indicators averaged around 5% by the end of the year.",
        "Nonfood inflation in particular was 4.4% in December 2007, which is similar to what it was in November.",
        "Several factors explain the annual variation in food prices (8.51%).",
        "On the one hand, weather conditions such as El Niño in the early months of 2007 and La Niña in the second half affected the supply of vegetables, fruits and tubers.",
        "On the other, increased bio-fuel demand and production brought pressure to bear on international prices for certain foods and agricultural supplies, while high oil prices raised transport rates and prices for a number of chemicals used in agriculture.",
        "This situation also prompted a change in the use of agricultural raw materials; some of those previously used for food are now going to produce bio-fuels.",
        "The growing demand for certain foodstuffs in Venezuela and the strength of local demand pushed up prices as well.",
        "Local economic growth remained strong.",
        "The reported annual increase in GDP during the third quarter of 2007 was 6.6%.",
        "This new information confirms that growth for the year as a whole will be around 7.0%.",
        "A slowdown is expected this year, the extent of which will depend on the international situation.",
        "Even so, technical studies done by the Bank show GDP growth will remain vigorous in 2008, near the average for the last five years.",
        "The foregoing is consistent with the good performance of exports, which continue to grow at a healthy pace, along with investment and the momentum in employment.",
        "As to employment in commerce, a sector survey shows an annual increase of 6.7% by November, rounding out two consecutive years of annual growth above 5%.",
        "Although it has not risen as much, industrial employment also completed six quarters with growth rates above 2%, having registered 2.5% annual growth in November.",
        "A number of indicators confirm the slowdown in the U economy.",
        "The housing market shows no signs of recovery, the restrictions on credit have increased, and sales, building permits and the execution of new housing projects continue to decline.",
        "Consequently, the coming months are expected to see a further drop in housing prices and major implications for financial soundness in the United States and other developed countries.",
        "Moreover, unemployment was up from 4.7% to 5% by December, and the number of jobs being created slowed considerably, which has not happened since the previous recession in 2001.",
        "Industrial production expectations detected in surveys are down to levels not witnessed since 2001.",
        "Household consumption, which was very sound until only recently, could be feeling the pinch judging by the decline in retail sales during December (-4.3% annualized monthly) and by the drift in consumer surveys.",
        "These doubts about the US economy have enhanced fears of a slowdown in other developed and developing economies.",
        "Added to this is the emergence of new inflation pressure originating with high oil and food prices and uncertainty about the future of Colombian exports to Venezuela.",
        "The increase in base money was 19.4% by the end of the year, as opposed to 15.3% in November and 10.9% one quarter earlier.",
        "The trend in this variable is associated with the recovery in the demand for cash and the increased demand for bank reserves after the marginal reserve requirement was raised midway through 2007.",
        "M3 registered 17.8% annual growth in December, which also is more than in past months.",
        "An increase in the share of certificates of deposit (CDT – Spanish acronym) to the detriment of saving accounts was another highlight.",
        "Loan portfolio growth in the financial system continued to slow during that period and was up by 23.6% at December.",
        "Commercial credit is showing signs of more momentum, as confirmed by larger disbursements.",
        "Part of this increase could be due to a shift from external credit to local loans due to the reinstatement of deposits required for external borrowing.",
        "Annual growth in retail loans and the total loan portfolio declined.",
        "Savings rates tended to decline in December, with the exception of the DTF.",
        "This was also the case with rates on retail, commercial and micro-credit and with the average lending rate.",
        "With this development in nominal rates and the rise in inflation during recent months, real rates tended to decline during the fourth quarter, ending the upward trend witnessed since early 2007.",
        "The following points were emphasized during the discussion: (i) Price increases that continue to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors.",
        "(ii) The considerable weight of food on inflation in 2008 and 2009 amid an international context marked by rising pressures (iii) The behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which continued to decline but is still above levels compatible with the targets (iv) Available indicators suggesting the momentum in aggregate demand remains high compared to production, but is showing signs of moderation (v) The uncertainty about the future of the world economy and that of our major export markets, particularly Venezuela (vi) The monetary-policy implications of the Board’s inflation targets and developments in inflation expectations, which rose last month due to inflation in 2007.",
        "The Board believes the indicators show the benchmark rate hikes and the change in reserve requirements have had an impact on lending and savings rates and have been effective in helping to curb the momentum in credit.",
        "In any case, the credit growth rate is still high.",
        "Although declining, the increase in local demand continues to exceed the growth in national production.",
        "The discussion among Board members focused on: (i) the effect of monetarypolicy measures, given the lag in their impact; (ii) the elements that shape inflation forecasts for 2008; (iii) the widening current account deficit, which shows local demand is growing faster than national production; (iv) the fact that international developments, in the context of a current account deficit, might lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate; (v) the uncertainty sparked by the extreme volatility on international markets and how it might affect the Colombian economy; and (vi) the need for the monetary authority to enhance its credibility as a strategy for anchoring inflation expectations, given the upward price trends countries face.",
        "The Board members were unanimous in stressing that the current environment is one of considerable uncertainty.",
        "Given the possible implications that less growth in the world economy could have for Colombia’s economic growth, they advised waiting for new information before making a decision on benchmark interest rates.",
        "In effect, less growth in the world economy could affect economic performance in Colombia, which would depend on the extent of the slowdown in those countries and its impact on exports, commodity prices, capital flows and remittances.",
        "Some of the members emphasized that inflation remains on a troubling upward course that is distancing it from the long-term target defined at the last meeting.",
        "This is manifest by the change in expectations.",
        "At the same time, they not rule out the need for additional hikes in the benchmark rate at some point in the future, if the figures suggest hikes are advisable to ensure that inflation targets are met and to maximize the sustainable economic growth rate.",
        "Other members reiterated that the current interest rate is consistent with a contractionist monetary policy and said that available information does not suggest the need for future benchmark rate hikes.",
        "They believe the country’s monetary policy is fulfilling its objectives in terms of curbing growth and credit and anchoring expectations to meet the inflation targets.",
        "In their opinion, it would be possible to return to a more neutral stance, depending on how external conditions develop and the trend in local price and employment levels.",
        "The Board unanimously decided to hold its benchmark rate at 9.50%.",
        "It also agreed on the importance of continuing to monitor the impact the international economic situation could have on growth, as well as the effect of inflation pressures brought to bear by international food and fuel prices.",
        "The Board of Directors unanimously agreed not to modify Banco de la República’s benchmark rates.",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia on November 21, 2008 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia was held in the city of Bogotá on November 21, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Central Bank of Colombia The situation and prospects with respect to inflation and economic growth were discussed and decisions on monetary policy were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting The yearly inflation for consumers in the month of October was of 7.94%, increasing 37 bp as compared to September, time in which it had decreased.",
        "The accumulated inflation during the first ten months of the year reaches 6.9%, and the different indicators of basic inflation increased during the last month.",
        "The inflation of non tradable goods, except food and regulated prices, was of 5.7%, as compared to 5.1% in September.",
        "This increase was concentrated in rentals and banking services and those related to entertainment.",
        "On the other hand, the inflation of tradable goods except food and regulated prices increased from 2.2% in September to 2.3% in October.",
        "Inflation of food in October increased by 38 bp as compared to the previous month, reaching 13.2%.",
        "The upward pressures were originated by the prices of beef meat and its substitutes and by those of cereals (particularly rice and corn), oils, and others.",
        "In this way, the increase in the prices of food explains the 67.97% in the acceleration of inflation during the course of the present year.",
        "The prices for regulated goods presented an annual increase of 10.8% in October, 33 bp higher than in the previous month, with the prices of gas and fuels standing out.",
        "The different measurements for the inflation expectations resulting from public debt bonds (to 1, 5, and 10 years) are still over the targets set by the Board.",
        "The annual variation of the producer prices (PPI) increased from 9.8% in September to 11.8% in October Internal Growth The information available shows that: Industrial production according to the DANE contracted to an annual rate of 3.3% in September, which produces a result of -1.1% to this date.",
        "With this new number, the industrial growth in the third trimester was of -3.4%.",
        "The industrial confidence indexes and the level of stock and demand provided by Fedesarrollo to September corroborate this trend.",
        "Retail sales contracted to a yearly rate of 2.5% in September, with which the growth in the trimester would have been null.",
        "The information from surveys by Fenalco until October confirms the loss of momentum in sales during the last six months.",
        "Something similar is suggested by the indicators produced by Fedesarrollo for the sector, such as the current economic situation and the expectations of economic situation six months from now.",
        "The numbers on energy demand to September and October showed improvement after a low registry in August.",
        "For example, in October the annual growth was of 3.8%, higher than the one observed along the year until September (2.1%).",
        "However, this increase could be due to the high demand from the mining sector instead of to a generalized recovery of the economy.",
        "For the fourth trimester, situations such as the strike of sugarcane collectors and the paralysis of the sugar refineries add up to the weak performance of the demand.",
        "Additionally, the possible consequences that the fall of the pyramids may bring on the consumption indicators in several regions must be considered.",
        "Regarding labor market, hired employment is falling, whereas the so- called self-employment continues to rise External Context The financial crisis has had consequences on the activity of the real sector.",
        "In the USA, the growth of the GNP during the third trimester entered a negative terrain with -0.3% (t/t) (according to the preliminary data), while the Euro zone completed two consecutive trimesters falling (each of -0.2% t/t), with which said economy could be technically in recession.",
        "Something similar happens in the UK and Japan, where growth has been null or negative in two trimesters.",
        "In China, although the expansion continues to be important, a significant deceleration has been observed in the last months.",
        "Facing this scenario, the economic authorities in the USA reformulated their salvage plan, emphasizing the recapitalization of the financial system and the creation of mechanisms to encourage credit.",
        "In Europe, although a joint economic program is expected, several countries such as Germany and Spain have decided to act individually.",
        "On the other hand, China announced a plan to strengthen its economy which reaches up to 17% of the GNP for 2007 (4 trillion Yuan), which would be performed during the following three years.",
        "The policies established by the economic authorities in the USA and in Europe have allowed the reduction of liquidity problems, although the situation has not yet returned to its full normality.",
        "At the same time, aversion to risk is still high and investors continue to seek refuge in more secure assets.",
        "During the first two weeks of November, the risk premiums of emerging economies decreased from the high levels reached by -October, but they remain high as compared to the observations made two or three months ago.",
        "These premiums could be affected by the particularly vulnerable situation in several countries of the Eastern Europe.",
        "The prices of the basic products have decreased rapidly.",
        "In the case of petroleum, the fall from July to the second week of November has been of 60%, leaving the price at about $55 dollars per barrel, a level that had not been experienced since 2005.",
        "For developed economies as well as for many countries which are importers of raw materials, these lower prices must result in a decrease in their inflation in the short term.",
        "However, for the countries which are exporters of raw materials such as those in the region, the inflationary situation is more complex since the fall in the prices will tend to be accompanied by a depreciation of their currencies.",
        "A reduction in inflation has not yet been observed in Latin America, while several currencies in the region have depreciated during the last months.",
        "Given the aforesaid, the panorama of the monetary policy is very diverse.",
        "On the one hand, the central banks of major economies (USA, Euro Zone, China) have reduced their rates upon perceiving lower inflationary risks and due to the existing preoccupation regarding growth.",
        "On the other hand, some emerging economies from Eastern Europe have increased their rates, while in Latin America they remain unaltered Financial variables The main monetary aggregates maintained expansion rates similar to those observed in previous months.",
        "The M3 and the liabilities under statutory reserve requirements grew at annual rates of 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
        "In October, the dynamics of liability portfolios continued on its path of moderation.",
        "The total liabilities in legal tender of the financial system showed an annual growth of 18.5%, as compared to a 19.1% one month before.",
        "Commercial liabilities grew 20.6% compared to 19.8% in September, while consumption liabilities grew at a rate of 14.9%, less than that of the previous month (17.6%).",
        "Mortgage liabilities also decelerated slightly.",
        "The majority of asset and liability rates diminished in October, in nominal as well as in real terms.",
        "In October, the average rate for customer acquisition for limited term deposit certificates descended 16 bp, reaching 10.3%.",
        "The DTF and savings rates increased slightly (10pb and 4bp respectively) reaching 10% and 5%.",
        "On the other hand, the active average rate calculated by Central Bank of Colombia reduced in 26pb as compared to the previous month, reaching 17.1%.",
        "Similarly, the interest rates of household credits diminished: consumption rates by 29 bp and credit card rates by 24 bp.",
        "This movement was accompanied by a fall in the usury rate of 73bp.",
        "The rates for commercial liabilities presented a mixed behavior, descending (51 bp) for ordinary credit, and increasing (24 bp) for treasury credit, and remaining stable in the case of the preferential rate.",
        "The Colombian Peso remained stable before the US Dollar since the last meeting of the Board of Directors AND In the development of the discussion the following issues were highlighted: (i) the rhythm of increase in prices continues to be above the targets established; (ii) the increase presented in the last month due mainly to the prices of non tradable goods; (iii) the international prices of food, raw materials, and petroleum continue to decrease, which might have an important effect on the total inflation within a few months, depending on the behavior of the exchange rate; (iv) the prices of regulated goods continued to increase, given the indexation mechanisms incorporated in the determination of the price lists and the inflation of non tradable goods; (v) the economic activity continues to weaken; (vi) the production costs of the companies show important increases, as is reflected by the increase in the growth rhythm of the PPI; the greatest depreciation of the Peso observed could be expressed in additional pressures; (vii) uncertainty over the future behavior of the world’s economy and of our main exportation markets, particularly those of Venezuela and Ecuador; viii) the effect of the exchange rate on the inflation and the growth of the tradable sectors; and ix) the behavior of the expectations of inflation for the medium and long terms, which continue to be higher than the targets set by the Board.",
        "The main issues discussed among the members of the Board were: i) the effect of the measures of monetary policy given their lag; ii) the elements that affect the projections of inflation for 2009 and 2010; iii) the behavior of inflation of the non tradable goods except food and regulated prices; iv) the effect that the short-term behavior of inflation may have over the formation of prices and salaries in 2009; v) the implications regarding the inflation observed as well as the expectations of inflation of the current policy of restriction to the importation of some agricultural products, whose impact on the basic food supply is significant; vi) the projections of deficit in the current account; vii) the effects of volatility in the exchange rate and the devaluation observed during the last months; viii) the uncertainty generated by the financial crisis around the world on international markets and their incidence on the Colombian economy; ix) the difficulty to evaluate the available information in a juncture in which there has been a rupture in the growth cycle; x) the balance of risks between growth and inflation in a context in which expectations of growth are maintained over the targets and the necessity of deceleration of the economy; and xi) the need to strengthen the credibility of the monetary authorities and anchor the expectations of inflation.",
        "The members of the Board emphasized the goodness and efficacy of the decisions on monetary policy adopted since April 2006, addressed to eliminating the excess of demand and the growth of credit, controlling the entrance of foreign speculative capital, strengthening the position of international reserves, and mitigating the effects over the inflation expectations of the highest international prices of basic products.",
        "They highlighted that the international deterioration still continues, which has caused restrictions on credit worldwide and a lower growth of our main commercial partners.",
        "Additionally, the information available shows that the productive sector in Colombia continues feeling the negative effects of the increase in costs and the fall in the demand, which is reflected in a lower growth dynamics of the GNP.",
        "The international crisis has also led the prices of assets to continue showing great volatility as well as to the increase in risk premiums and external interest rates for all emerging economies.",
        "The prices of food, the devaluation of the Peso, and eventually the higher salary costs could maintain total inflation high in the following months.",
        "However, it is expected that the weakness in the demand and the recent reduction in the international prices of the main basic products will turn out into less inflationary pressures in the future.",
        "Some directors highlighted from the aforesaid that it is not yet opportune to revise the approach of the monetary policy by reducing the interest rates for intervention.",
        "Even if some inflationary pressures have been reduced, there is as yet no evidence that they may be sufficiently under control.",
        "The same happens with the inflation expectations which remain in high levels.",
        "There is uncertainty especially on the behavior of the Exchange rate and its effects over the prices and the perspectives of salary increases to be decided in the coming months.",
        "The risks of the international crisis over the financing of the balance of payments constitute an additional argument to be cautious in the adoption of the monetary policy.",
        "Additionally, these directors considered that the commitment of the monetary authority with the long-term inflation targets promotes the conditions for a sustained growth of production and employment.",
        "Similarly, that in the present juncture, a premature change on the monetary policy could lead to an increase in the inflation expectations, which would raise the medium and long-term interest rates, bringing negative effects on the economic activity and the price of the titles in public debt.",
        "Acting without the necessary precaution would reduce the capacity of the monetary policy to operate in an anti-cyclic manner in the future.",
        "Another position within the Board considered that given the worldwide deterioration of economy and the fall of prices in basic products, as well as the subsequent reduction of inflationary pressures and expectations, a change in the monetary policy is opportune.",
        "Besides, they indicated that, in the internal scope, the new information continues showing that there is a pronounced fall in the growth of product.",
        "The negative behavior of the industry and commerce, the increase of its stock, and the reduction in the level of its orders, as well as the deterioration of the confidence indexes, the wilting of investment expectations and the feeling of consumers confirm the aforesaid.",
        "This reduction in the productive dynamics continues to be reflected in the increase of the national unemployment rate and the fall of hired employment.",
        "This group of directors indicated that the situation could become acute, depending on how the international crisis affects our main commercial partners.",
        "Considering that the monetary policy has to look ahead into a horizon of time of no less than one to two years, Central Bank of Colombia must begin a process to reduce the interest rate of intervention.",
        "On this matter, within this group there were two opinions: the first one stating that the aforesaid reduction should be of 25 basis point, and the second one stating that it should be at least of 50 basis point.",
        "On the other hand, the Board unanimously set the inflation target for 2009 within the range of 4.5% and 5.5%, with 5% as a punctual target for legal effects.",
        "Similarly, it set the medium term for the range of the inflation target for 2010 on 4%, and the members expressed their trust in that inflation will be in the range-long-term target of (3% +/- 1 percent point) in 2011.",
        "The new path for inflation considers the effects of the strong increase in the prices of food and regulated goods and services observed this year.",
        "This clash in prices, which took place in all world economies, produced a substantial increase in inflation and led to the non-fulfillment of the targets.",
        "The decisions on monetary policy are headed towards retaking a convergent path of inflation towards the long-term target.",
        "In 2009 it is expected that the reversion or moderation of these clashes in relative prices, as well as the accumulated effect of the adjustments in monetary policy carried out since 2006, will produce a meaningful reduction of annual inflation on consumers.",
        "The announcement of the new targets shows the commitment of the Board to achieve the long-term target.",
        "It is also a fundamental criterion to guide the decisions on prices and salaries in economy.",
        "Finally, the Board reiterated its commitment to providing the liquidity required by the economy by the end of the year and the need to continue tracking the international financial situation with the purpose of adopting measures of monetary policy which may be necessary to face its effects opportunely ON THE The Board of Directors agreed, by majority, to leave the interest intervention rates of the Central Bank of Colombia unaltered.",
        "On the other hand, the Board unanimously fixed the inflation target for 2009 within 4.5% and 5.5%, with 5% as a punctual target for legal effects and in 4% the medium term for the range of the inflation target for 2010.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on June 20, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Inflation, economic growth and their prospects for the future were discussed and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting Background Annual consumer inflation was 6.39% in May, which is 66 b more than in April, after having declined during the two previous months.",
        "Accumulated inflation in the first five months of the year was 5.1%.",
        "This is 70 b above the figure for the same period in 2007.",
        "All core inflation indicators were up in May and some remain above target.",
        "The build-up in inflation during May is explained largely by the way food prices behaved (up 9.7% in May compared to 7.8% in April), especially prices for perishables (potatoes and other vegetables and tubers) and imported foods.",
        "Non-food inflation was 4.8%, which is slightly above the rate in April (4.7%).",
        "The increase is attributed to 5.25% inflation in non-tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, compared to 5.05% in April.",
        "Annual rental inflation (4.7%) stayed close to the rate observed in May, while banking services experienced a new hike.",
        "Regulated price inflation went from 8.1% in April to 8.3% in May.",
        "Inflation in this basket of goods and services has been on the rise since September of last year, as a result of higher prices for fuel and public utilities.",
        "Tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, were the only group to experience less inflation, which went from 2.4% in April to 2.2% in May.",
        "The reduction in vehicle prices (-4.6% annual inflation) was a high point in this respect.",
        "Prices for consumer durables in general have declined, probably due to the impact of accumulated appreciation.",
        "Expectations of inflation at one year, based on analysts’ surveys and the price of internal debt paper, rose to above 5.5%.",
        "Annual PPI inflation was up from 3.8% in April to 5.4% in May Local Economic Growth The available figures on production, aggregate demand and income reflect the following: The household confidence indicator from the Fedesarrollo survey declined between January and May, compared to 2007.",
        "However, it is still relatively high.",
        "The annual increase in industrial production, excluding coffee processing, was 9.8% by April, following a 9.4% drop in March, which was explained, at the time, as primarily the result of fewer working days in March and the Cerromatoso strike.",
        "Annual growth during March-April was -0.2%.",
        "During the course of the year up to April, it was 3.5%.",
        "The figures released by DANE show retail sales rose 1.2% in April.",
        "This exceeds the rate in March, but is low compared to the increase observed at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008.",
        "With respect to sectors, the poorest performance was in food sales (-3.5%).",
        "Other sectors such as footwear and textiles also reported negative figures.",
        "Exports, in dollars, saw continued momentum during first quarter of 2008.",
        "Total accumulated exports at 12 months were up by nearly 30%.",
        "This is similar to the rate observed at the start of the year and more than the increase during 2007.",
        "Higher prices for a number of raw material exports, coupled with an increase in exported volume, explain the build-up in traditional exports so far this year (34% by March for the 12-month accumulated increase in dollars).",
        "By March, there was a 25% increase in non-traditional exports.",
        "Exports to Venezuela slowed during the past month, possibly due to the border restrictions imposed in March and the Easter holiday that same month.",
        "However, the reduction in growth was offset, in part, by an increase in non- traditional exports to the United States.",
        "Imports recovered in April compared to their performance in March.",
        "This suggests the Easter holiday in March may have had a statistical impact.",
        "The accumulated increase in total imports for 12 months remained at around 24%, which is similar to the rates observed since 2006.",
        "There was a bit less growth in imports of consumer goods, particularly durables.",
        "The DANE indicator of investment in works shows an annual drop of 30% in relation to the first quarter of 2007.",
        "More than expected, this slump may have been due to the turnover in local government administrations.",
        "The reduced figures for growth in industry, commerce and works during the first quarter would have been offset, in part, by better performance in the agricultural, mining and financial sectors.",
        "The figures from the Household Survey in April show the decline in unemployment continues in every area, but was less pronounced than in recent months.",
        "Quarterly unemployment rates were 11.3% for the nationwide total and 12.1% in the 13 principal urban areas, reflecting respective declines of 0.5 pp.",
        "compared to the same quarter in 2007.",
        "The reduction in unemployment is explained by more job creation in comparison to the labor supply, given that the number of employed persons nationwide increased at an annual rate of 4.5% The International Situation Indicators of economic activity in the United States during April and May show performance was better than international analysts had expected.",
        "This was particularly true in industry and services.",
        "Exports bolstered by a weak dollar could explain part of this outcome.",
        "Although the monetary and fiscal stimulus policies being applied in the United States have begun to cushion the slump in that nation’s economy, household consumption continues to be affected by tight credit, a weak job market, the impact of energy prices on available income, and the drop in housing prices.",
        "Inflation in the United States remains high and probably will continue to climb, given the recent hikes in international oil prices.",
        "Higher inflation has raised agents’ expectations, which increased considerably during the last two months.",
        "International analysts expect the US economy to grow by 0.8% during the remainder of the year and by 1.2% in 2009, which is below the historical average.",
        "Higher inflation and increased expectations of inflation were evident not only in the United States, but also in a number of emerging economies and several developed ones, particularly the euro zone.",
        "As a result, various central banks were prompted to raise interest rates or to announce possible rate hikes in the future, even though prospects for growth have slackened Financial Variables The growth in broader monetary aggregates continued to slow during May.",
        "The annual increase in M3 was 13.5%, which is less than what it was in April (13.9%).",
        "Liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR) performed similarly.",
        "The last two months continued to see a shift in LSR towards certificates of deposit (CDT).",
        "So far this year, the loan portfolio in the financial system has grown at an annual rate of nearly 20%.",
        "The peso portfolio continues to exhibit the most momentum, despite a nearly year-long tendency to decelerate.",
        "The retail loan portfolio continued to experience more of a decline in growth than the commercial and mortgage loan portfolios.",
        "By May, it had increased at an annual rate of 22.4%.",
        "The increase in commercial and mortgage loans throughout the year has been more stable, with respective rates of around 20.5% and 16.4%.",
        "Nominal interest rates were down in May.",
        "The sharpest decline was in lending rates, primarily those for retail (92 b), preferred (72 b) and ordinary credit (49 b).",
        "Deposit rates, including the DTF, fell by about 20 b The downturn in rates was somewhat more in real terms, given the increase in non-food inflation during May.",
        "The real average rate was slightly below its historic average (since 1986).",
        "The real retail lending rate was below this average, and less than the average registered since 2001.",
        "Average appreciation in January-May of this year was 14% compared to the same period in 2007.",
        "The sizeable influx of foreign capital continued, particularly in the oil and mining sectors Discussion and Policy Options The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: Continued price increases at rates that exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors; The considerable weight food brings to bear on prices in an international scenario marked by upward pressures; Uncertainty about how regulated prices will behave in the future, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine those rates and non-tradable inflation; The sizeable increase in production costs for companies in terms of raw materials and labor; Uncertainty about the future of the world economy and Colombia’s principal export markets, particularly Venezuela; How revaluation of the peso has affected inflation and prospects for growth in the tradable sectors; The course of inflation expectations, which continue to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors.",
        "The sharp impact on first-quarter GDP growth occasioned by the drop in investments in works and the uncertainty about its possible effect on future growth.",
        "The Board believes the intervention interest rate hikes instituted as of April 2006 and the change in reserve requirements midway through 2007 have affected lending and deposit rates, and have helped to slow the increase in loans and local demand, as was intended.",
        "The behavior of core inflation indicators and expectations of inflation confirm that growth in demand needs to be curbed to reduce inflationary pressures and to prevent unsustainable economic growth.",
        "The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence inflation forecasts for 2008 and 2009; (iii) the advisability of adopting monetary policy measures in a scenario of rising international prices for food and fuel; (iv) the continued upward trend in non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices; (v) a current account deficit that reflect more growth in local demand compared to the increase in national production; (vi) the effects of appreciation in the exchange rate; (vii) the possibility that developments on the international scene, in a situation with a current account deficit, might lead to future exchange rate adjustments; (viii) the uncertainty created by highly volatile international markets and how that volatility might affect the Colombian economy; (ix) the difficulty in assessing available data in a situation where there is a break in the cycle of sustained growth; (x) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context of rising inflation expectations and a slowdown in the economy; and (xi) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility as a way to anchor inflation expectations, given the possible side-effects of international food and fuel prices; The Board underscored the persistence of inflationary pressures worldwide, and stressed the importance of anchoring inflation and expectations of inflation to the targets, given the inflation forecasts for the coming months.",
        "Although external conditions continue to favor economic growth, the indicators available in May suggest that growth in local demand and output has slowed considerably.",
        "Consequently, the Board members believe intervention interest rates at their current level are doing what is required to curb the increase in demand and, therefore, consider it prudent to maintain the current monetary policy stance.",
        "The Board of Directors unanimously agreed to hold Banco de la Republica’s intervention interest rate at 9.75% and emphasized the importance of continuing to monitor the possible impact the international economic situation might have on growth, as well as the effect of inflationary pressures originating with international prices for food and fuel.",
        "It also agreed to step up the accumulation of international reserves during the remainder of 2008, so as to deal with any eventual deterioration in the international environment.",
        "This measure takes advantage of the fact that the exchange rate is now below sustainable levels.",
        "To counter the monetary effects of that measure, the Board decided to modify reserve requirements as of September 1 by eliminating the marginal reserve requirement and establishing an average ordinary reserve requirement of 10% (11.5% for checking and savings accounts and 6% for time certificates of deposit).",
        "If necessary, the Bank also will open its contraction windows Policy Decision The Board of Directors unanimously agreed to hold Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate steady at 9.75%.",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia on October 24, 2008 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia was held in the city of Bogotá on October 24, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Central Bank of Colombia The situation and prospects with respect to inflation and economic growth were discussed and decisions on monetary policy were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in September was 7.57%, having declined by 30 basis point compared to August.",
        "Accumulated inflation in the first nine months of the year came to 6.5%, while the various core inflation indicators rose during the past month.",
        "The reduction in inflation during September was due to food prices, with vegetables, fruits, tubers and milk exerting the least upward pressure.",
        "Annual inflation in regulated prices was 10.5% versus 9.4% in August.",
        "In this category, fuel prices and public utility rates, especially for gas and electricity, continued to exert upward pressure.",
        "Inflation in tradables declined from 2.3% in August to 2.2% in September.",
        "Non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, came to 5.1%, after having dropped to 5% in August.",
        "The increase was concentrated in rentals and services related to entertainment and recreation.",
        "The various measurements of inflation expectations based on local government bonds (at 1, 5 and 10 years) continued to ease, but are still above the long-term target for inflation.",
        "Annual producer inflation, measured by the total PPI, went from 9% in August to 9.8% in September Internal Growth The data at hand shows the following: The annual GDP growth rates in the first and second quarters were 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively.",
        "This meant growth during the first half of the year was 4.1%.",
        "Weakening internal demand was the factor that contributed the most to the decline in economic growth between the first and second quarters.",
        "The slowdown and low level of growth in household consumption (3.1% in the second quarter) were particularly conspicuous.",
        "Investment in works dropped again in the second quarter, by nearly 14%.",
        "Investment without works was the most dynamic component of internal demand, having risen substantially by almost 17% in the second quarter, which is very similar to the rate observed during the first quarter.",
        "As to third quarter, the various available indicators suggest the economy continued to slow, as illustrated by industrial growth figures for the month of August (-8.8%) compared to the same month in 2007 (-0.8% for the year to August).",
        "Retail sales dropped in August (-0.7%), and consumer sentiment was down again as well.",
        "During the period from January to August, the annual increase in Colombian imports came to 22.7%, reaching a value of U $ 25,785 (CIF).",
        "This is evidence of a slowdown compared with the same period in 2007, when the annual increase was 26.8%.",
        "Consumer goods provoked the reduction in import growth, having registered an annual variation of 11% in the first eight months of 2008 compared to 31.7% during the same period in 2007.",
        "Between January and August, imports of raw materials and capital goods registered respective annual increases of 29.1% and 21.5%.",
        "The increase in raw materials, in US dollars, particularly raw materials for industrial activity (20%), could be a reflection of the rise in international commodity prices, since the information shows less imported volume with respect to this item.",
        "During the course of the year to August, the dollar value of total Colombian exports came to U $ 26,142 million, with 41% annual growth.",
        "This increase is led by sales of traditional products, which had increased at an annual rate of 61% by August, bolstered mainly by high international prices, particularly for oil and coal.",
        "Non-traditional exports saw an annual increase of 22% between January and August 2008.",
        "On a country basis, during the course of the year to August, exports to the United States accounted for 39% of total exports and 21% of non- traditional exports.",
        "Exports to the United States have maintained their momentum, registering an increase of 54%, largely due to sales of petroleum and derivatives.",
        "Non-traditional exports to that market continued to recover, as they have since late 2007.",
        "During the year to August, the annual increase in those exports, without non-monetary gold, was 9.8%.",
        "Sales to Venezuela continue to slow, reporting 31% annual growth by August, which is lower than the figure observed by the same month in 2007 (75%).",
        "This was mainly due to fewer sales of transport equipment.",
        "Exports to the rest of the world have remained dynamic (35% annual growth by August), largely because of traditional products (50%) and non- traditional exports (18%).",
        "Using the latest breakdown, namely, for the year to July, sales of industrial products to countries other than the United States, Venezuela and Ecuador, grew at annual rates of 18%.",
        "As to the job market, salaried employment is falling, while so-called “self-employment” continues to rise The External Context At the international level, the events of the past month reveal a more profound financial crisis.",
        "This spells financing problems for a wide range of developed and emerging economies, which can have lasting effects on global economic performance.",
        "The rescue plans adopted by economic authorities in the United States and Europe have met with limited success and have failed to fully restore credit channels or to make borrowing less expensive.",
        "The prospects for world economic growth have fallen sharply in the current environment.",
        "Some indicators already show a great deal of deterioration, which seems to indicate that economies such as the United States and Europe are in a recession.",
        "The consumer confidence indexes and the manufacturing production index have declined sharply in recent months.",
        "Likewise, in the United States, commercial credit has begun to tighten a rate similar to what was observed in past recessions.",
        "This situation could aggravate problems for the financial system in many countries and jeopardize the stability of public finances, inasmuch as governments have announced guarantees to ensure deposits in the financial system.",
        "On par with the lower forecasts for global growth, commodity prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks.",
        "Given the actual and expected drop in prices for raw materials and the slowdown in growth worldwide, there is significantly less risk of inflation throughout the world.",
        "Therefore, the central banks of the developed countries are likely to lower their intervention rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In fact, during early October, the central banks of the developed economies acted in a coordinated way by lowering their benchmark interest rates to tackle the problems caused by the crisis.",
        "Even so, interest rates on short-term money markets in some countries were well above the intervention rates set by the central banks.",
        "This situation was coupled with an interest rate hike on loans, especially on commercial paper in the United States and Europe, which is exerting pressure on relevant interest rates for emerging countries Financial Variables Annual growth in the primary monetary aggregates declined during the past month.",
        "For example, the increase in M3 went from 16.3% to 14.6%.",
        "September saw the momentum in the loan portfolio continue to slow.",
        "During the past eight weeks, the annual increase in pesos went from 19.9% to 18.2%.",
        "The slowdown in the commercial loan portfolio during the past month reversed the trend observed since May.",
        "By October 3, the nominal annual increase in the retail loan portfolio was 15.5% as opposed to 16.4% at the end of August.",
        "The mortgage loan portfolio continued to expand at a rate of almost 16%.",
        "Deposit rates remained close to what they were in August.",
        "In real terms, the average interest rate on credit calculated by the Central Bank of Colombia and the DTF were below the historic averages compiled since 1986.",
        "As a result of the uncertainty on international markets, the exchange rate has devaluated 8% since the Board of Directors held its last meeting AND The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: The rate of growth in prices still exceeds the targets and the decline this past month was mainly due to lower food prices.",
        "International prices for food, raw materials and oil continue to decline.",
        "This could have an important effect on total inflation in the next few months, depending on how the exchange rate performs.",
        "Regulated prices continued to rise, given the indexation mechanisms used to determine rates and non-tradable inflation.",
        "In contrast to past months, the CPI without food and regulated prices ceased to decline in September.",
        "Economic activity continues to weaken.",
        "Companies have seen major increases in production costs, as reflected by the PPI growth rate.",
        "There is uncertainty about how the world economy and Colombia’s largest export markets, particularly Venezuela and Ecuador, will perform in the future.",
        "The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and prospects for growth in the tradable sectors were discussed as well.",
        "Intermediate and long-term expectations for inflation continue to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors, despite a decline this past month.",
        "The discussion among the Board members centered primarily on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that influence inflation forecasts for 2009; (iii) the behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices; (iv) forecasts for the current account deficit; (v) the effects of exchange rate volatility and devaluation observed in recent weeks; (vi) the uncertainty generated by the world financial crisis in international markets and its impact on the Colombian economy; (vii) the difficulty of assessing the data on hand in a situation where there the growth cycle has come to a halt; (viii) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where inflation expectations remain above target and economic activity has slowed; and (x) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "The Board members highlighted the virtues and effectiveness of the monetary policy decisions adopted as of April 2006 to eliminate surplus demand and credit in the economy, to control the influx of foreign speculative capital, to strengthen the balance of international reserves, and to mitigate the effects of higher international commodity prices on inflation expectations.",
        "The dramatic deterioration in the international situation during the past month was emphasized.",
        "It has heightened restrictions on credit worldwide and further slowed economic growth for our major trading partners.",
        "Also, available information shows the productive sector in Colombia is feeling the negative effects of high costs and less demand.",
        "These negative effects, in turn are reflected in less GDP growth.",
        "The international crisis has led to sustained volatility in asset prices and to an increase in risk premiums and external interest rates for all the emerging market economies.",
        "In Colombia, this was echoed by devaluation of the peso, the drop in stock prices and the increase in interest rates on long-term TES.",
        "Food prices, peso devaluation and, eventually, higher wage costs could keep total inflation up in the coming months.",
        "However, weak demand and the recent decline in international commodity prices are expected to mean less inflationary pressures in the future.",
        "Nevertheless, several Board members indicated this does not mean the stance of the country’s monetary policy should be revised by lowering intervention interest rates, at least for now.",
        "There is still a risk of larger increases in the general price level, even though some inflationary pressures have subsided.",
        "The same can be said of inflation expectations, which remain high.",
        "Above all, it is uncertain how the exchange rate will behave and how it will affect prices and prospects for the wage hikes that are scheduled to be decided in the coming months.",
        "Those members also felt the monetary authority’s commitment to the long-term targets for inflation favors the conditions required for sustained growth in production and employment.",
        "Moreover, in view of the current situation, the indication is that a premature change in the country’s monetary policy could increase inflation expectations.",
        "This would raise intermediate and long-term interest rates, which would have a negative effect on economic activity and government bond prices.",
        "Any action taken without due caution would make it more difficult for the country’s monetary policy to operate in an anti-cyclical way in the future.",
        "Given the downturn in the world economy, the slump in commodity prices, and the subsequent reduction in inflationary pressure, the Board indicated that a change in the stance of the country’s monetary policy would be appropriate.",
        "As to the local environment, it was pointed out that, among other manifestations of the economic slowdown, the figures reflect a continued decline in output growth; an 8.8% drop in industrial production during August and 0.8% so far this year; a persistent rise in inventories and a reduction in the extent of orders; deterioration in the confidence index; an increase in idle capacity; fading expectations of investment and a decline in consumer sentiment; a weakening commercial sector; an increase in the national unemployment rate and a 6.9% reduction in salaried employment.",
        "This situation could become more acute, depending on how the international crisis will affect Colombia’s major trading partners.",
        "Considering that monetary policy is projected on a time line of no less than 18 months to two years, the best course is to being a normalization process by reducing the Central Bank’s intervention interest rate.",
        "There were different opinions on this point.",
        "Some of the members said the reduction should be 25 basic points, while others felt it should be 50 basic points.",
        "The Board discussed a package of measures intended to help the money and credit markets operate properly and to provide proper liquidity.",
        "The aim is to avoid increases that place interest rates above the intervention rates, as has happened in other countries.",
        "Finally, it was noted that the international financial situation will have to be monitored carefully and the monetary policy measures required to deal with its impact will have to be adopted in due course The Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, to hold the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates steady.",
        "It also agreed unanimously on the following measures: A reduction in bank reserve requirements from 11.5% to 11% for current and savings accounts, and from 6% to 4.5% for term deposits under 18 months.",
        "These reductions will take effect as of the two-week reserve maintenance period that begins on November 19.",
        "An extension from two to three weeks in the reserve calculation for the end of the year.",
        "Temporary liquidity granted with repo operations that mature at 14 and 30 days, and the definitive purchase Col$ 500 billion in TES, plus the peso equivalent of the sale of foreign exchange through call options.",

        "The Lombard contraction window will be left open.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on February 22, 2008.",
        "Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor of Banco de la República Full-time Members of the Board of Directors: Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Juan Mario Laserna Mr. Leonardo Villar Inflation and economic growth, and their prospects for the future were discussed, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the principal issues addressed during the meeting Background Annual inflation was 6% at the end of January, which amounts to an increase for the fourth month in a row.",
        "This figure is 31 b above the annual rate of inflation registered the month before and 150 b above the top of the target range for 2008.",
        "Higher inflation in January was due fundamentally to the way food prices behaved.",
        "During that month, annual inflation in non-tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, remained stable at around 5.2%.",
        "The various core inflation indicators stayed close to 5%.",
        "The non- food inflation indicator went from 4.4% in December to 4.5% in January.",
        "With respect to food inflation, the sharp rise in January is explained by perishables, particularly potatoes, vegetables and eggs.",
        "Processed food inflation declined slightly.",
        "Even so, annual inflation in that sub-group remained high (9.7%).",
        "Processed foods are being affected by high international prices, which have been hit by the shift in agricultural supply towards bio-fuel production and by soaring demand in China, India and other emerging economies Local Economic Growth Local economic growth remains strong.",
        "This fact supports the estimates developed by the Bank’s technical team, which place GDP growth at around 7% in 2007 and 5% in 2008.",
        "The figures on industrial production show a 7.7% average increase in growth between October and November.",
        "This is high, but less than the figure for the third quarter (8.5%).",
        "Commercial retail sales behaved similarly.",
        "The consumer confidence indicator based on the survey was historically high during the final quarter of 2007.",
        "Imports increased by 24.5%.",
        "The build-up in imports of capital goods was particularly important.",
        "This suggests that investment remained strong towards the end of the year.",
        "Imports of consumer goods increased by 28.4%, but have slow somewhat since April 2007.",
        "Traditional and non-traditional exports continued to expand during October and November.",
        "The momentum in traditional exports was due to higher international prices.",
        "The crucial point in terms of non-traditional exports was the 84% annual increase in sales to Venezuela, as opposed to 70% at the end of the third quarter (accumulated figure for 12 months).",
        "Non-traditional exports to Venezuela now account for 8.44% of GDP.",
        "The news about the US economy in January and February to date supports the lower growth forecasts.",
        "In fact, January’s job creation figures were negative for the first time since -2003.",
        "The leading indicator for the service sector suffered a major setback that same month, something not seen since the previous recession in 2001, while the consumer confidence index in February dropped to levels not registered since the early nineties.",
        "Moreover, the figures for the housing market up to November 2007 point to added deterioration at the end of last year.",
        "As to the Fed’s interest rates, the market expects to see further cuts in the coming months, specifically to the tune of about 75 basis points.",
        "This would place the benchmark rate for federal funds at approximately 2.25% in June.",
        "However, the relatively high figure for US core consumer inflation in January (2.5% in annual terms) could curb those reductions.",
        "The slowdown in economic growth in the United States has yet to have a palpable impact on world demand or on prices for raw materials.",
        "In fact, raw material prices continued to rise at the start of the year and are now at historically high levels.",
        "The increases have been particularly significant in the case of agricultural products, including coffee, and in goods exported by Colombia, such as coal and gold Financial Variables M3 is up by about 18% since September.",
        "The build-up in deposits in the form of CDs is a high point, having registering an increase of nearly 35% in January.",
        "In the financial system, loan portfolio growth continued to slow.",
        "By January, the annual increase in total credit was 23.5%.",
        "This is less than the figures registered in December (24.5%) and September (28.2%), but is still more than expected nominal GDP growth.",
        "The most pronounced slowdown in the last six months has been in retail loans (by approximately 31%), although they continue to grow at a high rate.",
        "The interbank interest rate (TIB – the acronym in Spanish) stayed at around 9.40%, which is slightly below Banco de la República’s benchmark rate.",
        "Most other nominal rates increased in January, particular those on credit card, retail and ordinary loans.",
        "Although the difference between the Fed’s interest rates and those of Banco de la República increased by 125 b.p, the decline in relative interest rates in the United States was offset by the increase in Colombia’s risk premium Discussion and Policy Options The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: (i) The pace of price hikes, which continues to exceed the targets set by the Board of Directors; (i) The considerable weight of food on inflation in an international context marked by upward pressures; (ii) The behavior of non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, which halted the downward trend witnessed in previous months; (iii) Available indicators suggesting the momentum in aggregate demand remains high compared to production, but is showing signs of moderation; (iv) Uncertainty about the future of the world economy and that of Colombia’s principal export markets, above all Venezuela; (v) The trend in inflation expectations, which have increased in recent months to levels that exceed the targets established by the Board of Directors.",
        "According to the Board, a number of indicators show the benchmark interest rate hikes and the change in reserve requirements have had an impact on interest rates for loans and deposits, and have been useful in helping to achieve the objectives with respect to a more moderate increase in credit.",
        "However, credit growth rates are still high.",
        "Moreover, the increase in local demand has decline, but continues to exceed the growth in national production.",
        "The principal points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that shape the inflation forecasts for 2008; (iii) the appropriateness of adopting monetary policy measures in a context of rising international food and fuel prices (iv) the widening current account deficit, which indicates local demand is growing faster than national production; (iv) the fact that international developments, in the context of a current account deficit, might lead to future adjustments in the exchange rate; (v) the uncertainty sparked by the extreme volatility on international markets and how it might affect the Colombian economy; and (vi) the need for the monetary authority to enhance its credibility as a way to anchor inflation expectations, given the upward trend in prices countries face.",
        "The majority of the Board members felt an increase of 25 b in the benchmark rates is necessary to make certain the inflation targets are met and to maximize the sustainable economic growth rate.",
        "That opinion is based on the following factors.",
        "(i) Although the momentum in aggregate demand has slowed, thanks to recent monetary policy decisions, the available figures show it remains strong.",
        "The same is true of credit growth.",
        "Despite a downward trend, it continues to exceed its historic averages.",
        "(ii) The various indicators of expectations for inflation one year or more from now show they have increased in recent months, making any future reduction in inflation more costly.",
        "(iii) Food and fuel prices could continue to rise sharply, which would keep total inflation high, particularly since some internal price hikes have yet to be incorporated into internal price performance.",
        "(iv) There is still no evidence that the Colombian economy has been affected by the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe.",
        "Terms of trade are at historically high levels, the flow of trade remains positive, and the growing influx of foreign direct investment reflects international investor confidence.",
        "(v) It is the momentum in foreign direct investment, not short-term capital flows induced by differences in interest rates between Colombia and other countries, that explains the net capital inflow in the country’s the exchange balance.",
        "(vi) The benchmark rate hike shores up the credibility of the country’s monetary policy and facilitates the anti-cyclical policy in the future.",
        "In contrast, other Board members felt the benchmark rate should not be increased for the following reasons: (i) Due to previous increases in the benchmark rate, which has been among the highest in the region for the last two years, interest rates on loans have risen as well, and will continue to do so during the remainder of 2008, thanks to the remnant effects of policy lag.",
        "It takes approximately 18 months to two years for monetary measures to work their way through to the economy.",
        "(ii) According to the models, although the output gap has been positive for the past two years, it has begun to change because of the interest rate hikes.",
        "(iii) The Colombian economy is facing the effects of a severe external shock brought on by food and fuel prices, which is reflected in inflation expectations.",
        "(iv) The economy in 2008 is expected to slow to a growth rate of 5%, assuming there is 0.8% growth in the United States economy.",
        "However, recent forecasts indicate it would only be around 0.5%.",
        "(v) The reduction in the use of installed industrial capacity is obvious, as is the drop in the industrial confidence index, the slowdown in the demand for energy, consumer durables and housing, the downturn in the demand for household loans and the decline in the loan portfolio, especially retail credit.",
        "(vi) Gross fixed capital formation is still at record historic levels, having reached 27% of GDP.",
        "(vii) Core inflation, without food, which is the inflation indicator that should react to monetary policy through interest rates, is still within the target range.",
        "(viii) The difference between the benchmark rates in Colombia and the United States has increased by 200 b since September 2007.",
        "A continuation of that expansion would cause the Colombian peso to revaluate even more.",
        "The extent of its revaluation in the last five years has been among the highest of any currency in the world, and further revaluation would seriously jeopardize the tradable sectors and job creation.",
        "In view of the foregoing, the Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, to raise the Bank’s benchmark rate to 9.75%.",
        "It also indicated the impact the international economic situation could have on growth, as well as the effect of inflation pressures originating with international food and fuel prices, must continue to be monitored carefully.",
        "By a majority vote, the Board of Directors agreed to raise Banco de la República’s benchmark rate by 25 b"

        "Regulated price inflation went from 9.0% in February to 8.1% in March, mainly because of public utilities, residential natural and gasoline.",
        "Non-tradable inflation, without food and regulated prices, was 5.36%.",

        "The various inflation-expectation indicators measured on the basis of local government bonds at 1, 5 and 10 years were between 3.5% and 4.7% at the start of April.",
        "This is the lowest level since -2006.",
        "The annual variation in producer prices (PPI) rose from 6.2% in February to 6.8% in April Internal Growth Available figures show internal economic activity continued to slow faster than was anticipated the quarter before by the Central Bank’s technical team.",

        "The drop in non-traditional exports (14.8%) was slightly larger than the decline in traditional exports (13.6%).",
        "Coal was the only traditional export item to register an increase (88% annual), thanks to larger volumes sold.",
        "The lower export values for other products (oil and ferronickel) were the result of price declines.",
        "As to non-traditional exports, by destination, sales to Venezuela were less dynamic in every aspect, compared to the same month the year before.",
        "In all, they registered an annual decline of 20% in January Exports to Ecuador increased at an annual rate of 1.7%, bolstered by the industrial sector, particularly food and beverages, transport material and graphic arts.",

        "These figures represent respective increases of 0.8 pp and 1.5 pp compared to those registered for the same period in 2008.",
        "As was the case in February, the expansion witnessed during March is due largely to growth in the labor supply (measured by the global participation rate) The External Context The economy and commerce worldwide contracted sharply during the first quarter of 2009, adding to the drop witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2008.",
        "This outcome confirms the fears of a pronounced and larger-than-expected recession in the global economy.",

        "The annual variation in nominal exports, in dollars, declined at annual rates of 25% in January and February, both in the Euro zone and the United States, respectively.",
        "The drop in this variable is particularly dramatic in Japan, where the annual decline was around 48% in February.",
        "In terms of impact, the collapse has caused a sharp GDP reduction in the developed economies.",
        "In short, the current situation in the developed economies is characterized by a generalized loss of consumer and investor confidence, which has lowered spending levels dramatically and been reinforced by a noticeable increase in restrictions on loans.",
        "The first quarter of 2009 saw no change in this respect, as suggested by the additional decline in consumer confidence indicators.",
        "Business confidence indicators have been slightly less negative in the last two months, although the perception of the economic situation is still very pessimistic.",

        "The mortgage loan portfolio continued to grow at an annual rate of around 14%.",
        "External borrowing in the private sector was down by US$259 million in January and February.",
        "This was due a reduction in the foreign-currency denominated portfolio of exchange market intermediaries.",
        "Direct borrowing rose slightly (by US$63 million), but not enough to offset the drop in the foreign-currency portfolio.",
        "Interest rates continued to decline quickly, following the Central Bank’s benchmark rate.",

        "The drop in nominal rates allowed for a reduction in real rates during recent months, including March.",
        "The real rates on preferential and treasury lending remain above their historic averages (calculated since 1998 and 2001).",
        "Those on commercial loans already are below average, and those on consumer lending have fluctuated around average AND The following points were emphasized during the Board’s deliberations: Price increases at rates that continue to exceed the targets for inflation set by the Board, but have shown a tendency to decline.",
        "The absence of signs of a reduction in non-tradable inflation, excluding food and regulated prices.",

        "The continued decline in economic activity, which is occurring faster than the Bank’s technical team had anticipated.",

        "The main points of the discussion among Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010, and particularly the indexing mechanisms incorporated into some prices; (iii) the uncertainty the world financial crisis has generated on international markets and its impact on the Colombian economy; (iv) the region’s access to external financing and the reasons for less momentum in the financial system’s loan portfolio; (v) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where the economy is slowing faster than anticipated and inflation expectations have declined; and (vi) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "The Board members highlighted the fact that consumer inflation was down for the fifth month in a row.",
        "The decline in inflation and expectations of inflation ratifies the fact that weak internal and external demand and the drop in international commodity prices are bringing less pressure to bear on inflation.",
        "The Board also emphasized the faster-than-expected deterioration in the world economy during the first quarter of 2009.",
        "Despite signs of stabilization in some of the industrialized countries, the negative effects of the world crisis are expected to continue throughout the year.",
        "In Latin America, the generalized drop in industrial production is a reality, as is the decline in inflation.",
        "It was noted that the sharp devaluation in Latin American currencies at the start of 209 has been corrected.",
        "Available figures show similar performance for the Colombian economy, with a slowdown in exports and subsequently weaker growth.",
        "The latest information on industry and commerce signals sharp cutbacks.",
        "However, the financial system continues to perform well.",
        "Under these conditions, and considering the low level of capacity utilization, one would expect inflation in Colombia to continue to decline in the months ahead.",
        "In fact, it might end the year below the -point of the target range.",
        "In view of the foregoing, the members of the Board unanimously agreed to lower the Central Bank’s intervention rate to 6%.",
        "This is a reduction of 100 bp.",
        "The cumulative 400 bp reduction in the intervention interest rate since December 2008 bolsters economic growth.",
        "Recent developments in Colombia and throughout the world make for a low risk balance in terms of economic activity and inflation.",
        "This allows the Board to continue to implement a policy designed to reduce the Central Bank’s intervention rates.",
        "Finally, the Board reiterated the need to continue to monitor the international financial situation, so monetary policy measures needed to address its impact can be adopted without delay.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed to reduce the Central Bank’s intervention interest rate by 100 bp, placing it at 6%.",

        "The latter one is above the long range goal announced by the Board (2% - 4%).",
        "The annual variation for producer prices (PPI) declined from 1.4% in July to 1% in August Growth The annual growth of the GDP for the second quarter of the year was -0.5%.",
        "Compared to the first quarter, the second posted an increase of 0.7%.",
        "The annual tightening in the second quarter was mainly due to a downswing in domestic demand (2.1% annually).",
        "Net exports in real pesos (exports minus imports) made a positive contribution.",
        "The investment in public works was the most dynamic component of domestic demand (annual growth of 40.6%) while the investment in machinery and equipment plunged (-18.4%).",
        "Household consumption fell more than it in the first quarter due to the effect of the consumption of durable goods (-7.2%) and non-durable goods (-2.0%).",

        "The core inflation indicators continued to decline.",

        "The reduction was due to the drop in internal demand (-0.5%) and exports in real pesos (-0.5%).",
        "Because the decline in imports was similar (-0.5% in real pesos), the contraction in net external demand was less (-0.4%) and its contribution to the setback in GDP was quite small.",

        "Total exports during the course of 2009, up to May, came to US$2,719 This represents a decline compared to the same period last year and was primarily the result of fewer exports of oil and petroleum derivatives to the U market.",

        "These annual increases are similar to the ones posted in the moving quarter ended in March External Context Although the world economy continued to contract during the second quarter, several indicators of confidence, credit, corporate earnings and inventory and orders in the industrial economies allow for more optimism with respect to the end of the recession.",

        "The Board members highlighted the fact that annual consumer inflation (3.81%) was down for the eighth straight month.",
        "Once again, food and regulated prices were responsible for the decline, which was more than expected.",
        "The core inflation indicators declined yet again, and medium and long-term expectations for inflation were near to ceiling of the long-term range targeted by the Board of Directors (3%+/- one percentage point).",
        "The pattern in prices shows that weak internal and external demand, lower inflation expectations and the drop in commodity prices compared to the high point in 2008 spell less inflationary pressure.",

        "(i) The sharp increase in the money supply, the decline in food and regulated price inflation, a less negative external environment and the added momentum in works point to a gradual recovery in economic growth as of the second half of the year.",
        "ii) The slump in consumer inflation so far this year is due, in part, to temporary factors that could turn around in the future.",
        "(iii) Lower interest rates are not likely to have much of a positive impact on productive activity due to the weight of external factors in the reason for the slowdown in the country’s economic growth.",
        "(iv) Contrary to the situation in other countries, the Colombian economy is not experiencing a financial crisis that would justify extreme policy measures and unusually low interest rates.",
        "(v) The growth figures for the loan portfolio suggest its momentum is affected not by liquidity problems, but by insufficient demand for credit.",
        "The members believe the current stance of the country’s monetary policy makes it possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation towards its long-term targets.",
        "Another Board member requested an evaluation of the impact of the different types of exchange intervention and proposed the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates be lowered by 50 basis points, taking into account a number of supervening facts; namely, (i) an increasingly negative output gap, as indicated by continued economic decline and rising unemployment; (ii) the growing trade risks for Colombia posed by Venezuela and Ecuador; (iii) the sharp appreciation in the Colombian peso, among highest in the region and above that of our main competitors; and (iv) an inflation rate at June that is the lowest in the last 47 years and will continue to decline in the months ahead to a point well below the target range by the end of the year The Board of directors agreed, by a majority vote, to hold the Central Bank’s intervention rate at 4.5%.",

        "Real interest rates (deflated by the CPI without food) also exhibited a generalized reduction in January and particularly in February.",
        "This was due to the combination of lower nominal rates and the increase in non-food inflation during February AND The following points were emphasized during the course of the Board’s deliberations: The increase in prices continues at a rate that exceeds the targets for inflation set by the Board, but has shown a tendency to decline.",

        "The Board members highlighted the fact that consumer inflation was down for the fourth month in a row.",
        "The decline in inflation and lower expectations of inflation confirm that weak internal and external demand and the drop in international commodity prices are bringing less inflationary pressure to bear.",

        "The latest figures on industry and commerce point to sharp cutbacks.",
        "Given these conditions and considering the low level of capacity use, inflation in Colombia is expected to continue to decline.",
        "In view of the foregoing, the members of the Board unanimously agreed to lower the Central Bank’s intervention rate to 7%, which implies a reduction of 100 b The 300 b reduction in the intervention interest rate accumulated since December 2008 fuels economic growth.",
        "These policy decisions could be reached quickly, inasmuch as recent developments in Colombia and around the world have lowered the balance of risk both in terms of economic activity and inflation.",
        "Finally, the Board reiterated the need to continue to monitor the international financial situation, so any monetary policy measures that might be needed to address its impact can be adopted at the right time The Board of Directors agreed to cut the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates by 100 b, placing the intervention rate at 7%.",

        "The annual variation in producer prices (PPI) declined from 10.9% in November to 9% in December Internal Growth The slowdown in local economic activity during the second half of 2008 occurred faster than the Central Bank’s technical team had expected.",
        "In December, DANE released the third-quarter growth rate (3.1%) and revised the figure for the second quarter from 3.7% to 3.8%.",
        "As a result, growth during the first three quarters came to 3.8%, which is less than the figure for 2007 (7.5%).",
        "The figures for the third quarter show that private consumption continues to weaken, especially in the case of durable goods.",
        "There has been quite a slowdown in exports in real pesos, largely due to smaller volumes of coffee and coal and fewer non-traditional exports (textiles, garments, plastics and machinery), primary to the United States and Venezuela.",
        "Less growth during the third quarter, compared to the second, is explained by the poor performance of both these aggregates.",
        "On the other hand, investment growth remained high, even more so than during the first half of the year, thanks to the recovery in works.",
        "Investment in buildings also saw significant growth, somewhat similar to the increase in other private investments.",
        "This is judging by the extent to which imports of capital goods had increased by that time (23.9% in dollars).",
        "Available indicators for the third quarter show that performance not live up to expectations and tended to decline.",
        "Industry is the most obvious case in point, having experienced a sharp slowdown during October and November compared to the same months in 2007 (7.5% and 13.3% respectively).",
        "Transport material and textiles and garments were the sectors that reported the largest reductions, due to less internal and external (Venezuela) demand.",
        "As to commerce, the drop in retail sales during November (2.9%) was associated largely with vehicles.",
        "Business opinion surveys confirm the economic slowdown that is reflected in the sector indicators.",
        "These surveys also show that businessmen are quite pessimistic about how they expect their sectors to perform during the first six months of 2009.",
        "As to the external sector, imports were still growing at a decent pace by November 2008, thanks largely to imports of capital goods.",
        "That same month, imports of raw materials declined sharply in value for the first time during the year, while imports of consumer goods continued to lose speed.",
        "However, they were still at historically high levels.",
        "Total exports continued to deteriorate in October 2008, but with annual growth rates that remained high.",
        "Prices for oil and other mining products have been falling since -2008; this has cut into the monthly sales value of these exports.",
        "The monthly value of non-traditional exports was less during August and September, but increased again in October, mainly due to the rise in sales to Venezuela and Ecuador.",
        "The latest employment figures show a loss in jobs, but higher “self- employment” numbers took some of the edge off that situation.",
        "Nevertheless, growth in self-employment has slowed since -2008.",
        "Although the labor supply has declined, the number of employed persons has declined even more, which means higher unemployment The External Context The depth of the international financial crisis and the recession in the United States and Europe was confirmed in December.",

        "The United States is a case in point.",
        "Signs of economic slowdown in Latin America were more evident during the last month and a half.",
        "Industrial production and retail sales indicators show contraction in the November figures for countries such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.",
        "All of this translates into less international trade.",
        "For example, in the United States, the dollar value of exports fell by 1.6% yr/yr in November.",
        "The decline in the European economies fluctuated between 15% and 20% yr/yr.",
        "As to economies such as Japan and China, it was 14% in November and 2% yr/yr in December, respectively.",
        "In Latin America, the export sectors in most countries are now feeling the effects of the worldwide slowdown.",
        "The financial crisis in the developed economies has yet to be contained.",

        "Up until early January, the situation for emerging economies was more encouraging.",
        "The deterioration in risk indicators (EMBI and CDS) was brought to an end, but at higher levels than those in September.",
        "At the start of January, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico managed to borrow in dollars - at not overly high rates - through bond issues on demand, which suggests the capital markets remain open for emerging sovereign issuers.",
        "On the exchange market, the recent upward movement in the exchange rate is associated with growing international risk aversion and the prospect of lower benchmark interest rates throughout the region The decline in world demand and the drop in commodity prices have been accompanied by a quick reduction in inflation in the developed economies and in a number of emerging markets.",
        "The central banks in several Latin American and emerging market economies, including Colombia, have responded by beginning to lower their benchmark rates.",
        "As a result, the growth estimates for our trading partners are also lower.",
        "In 2009, growth is expected to be somewhere between -1.6% and -2.5% in the United States, between -1.3% and -2.3% in Europe, and between 0% and 2.5% in Venezuela.",
        "Commodity price projections have fallen on par with the lower forecasts for world growth.",

        "The real DTF averaged 4.8%, and average interest on lending (the Bank’s method) was 12%.",
        "These are similar to the historic averages calculated since 1986, and above those registered since 2001.",
        "The Board emphasized the following points in its deliberations: The pace of price hikes continues to exceed the inflation targets.",
        "International prices for food, raw materials and oil continue to fall.",
        "This could have a major impact on total inflation in the next few months, depending on the exchange rate and the country’s trade policy, particularly with respect to food imports.",
        "The annual change in regulated prices has begun to decline, even though the drop in oil prices on the international market has not been passed on to local gasoline prices.",

        "Intermediate and long-term expectations for inflation, which are still above the targets set by the Board of Directors.",
        "The main points of discussion among Board members centered on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010; (iii) how the behavior of inflation in the short term might affect prices and wages in 2009; (iv) the fact that some core inflation indicators have not declined; (v) projections on the current account deficit; (vi) the uncertainty the world financial crisis has generated in international markets and how it affects the Colombian economy; (vii) depreciation of the peso against the dollar in the last few weeks; (viii) the improvement in the region’s access to external financing in recent weeks, the decline in long-term interest rates, and the momentum in the loan portfolio held by the financial system; (ix) the balance of risk between growth and inflation in a context where inflation expectations are still above target and the slowdown in economic activity has been more than expected; and (x) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "Although consumer inflation was 7.67% in December of last year, which is over the target set by the Board of Directors for 2008, it was emphasized that weak local and external demand and falling international commodity prices should mean less inflationary pressure throughout 2009.",
        "The Board is confident that consumer inflation this year will be within the target range (5% +/- half a percentage point) and continue to decline towards the medium and long-term objective (3% +/- 1 percentage point).",
        "The members of the Board also noted that world economic performance remains negative, despite the strong expansive policies adopted by countries.",
        "Most of the developed economies are seeing less growth, while the emerging economies are experiencing what is, in some cases, a dramatic slowdown.",
        "If the rate of world economic growth is below its long-term tendency and international commodity prices fall, world inflation will be much less in 2009.",
        "If the exchange rate remains stable and an appropriate commercial policy is applied, this expected decline in international inflation should pass through relatively quickly to consumer prices in Colombia.",
        "There are new figures that confirm productive activity in Colombia has weakened.",
        "The latest information on industry and commerce shows more of a decline than what the Board anticipated at its last meeting.",
        "Added to this situation are the effects the world economic slowdown has on production, via lower exports and terms of trade, less confidence and most expensive capital flows.",
        "The Board of Directors believes the time is right to continue to lower the intervention rate and to consolidate the steps initiated in the final quarter of 2008 to change the stance of Colombia’s monetary policy.",
        "The opportunity and speed at which our monetary policy can be relaxed during 2009 will depend on whether inflation behaves as forecast.",
        "It also will hinge on expectations with respect to the targets.",
        "Most of the Board felt that lowering the Bank’s intervention interest rate at a time of financial market instability at home and abroad must be done in a way that aims for credibility and confidence among economic agents.",
        "This will ensure the monetary authority can continue to use the policy tools at its disposal in a countercyclical way.",
        "Caution is particularly important for several reasons; namely, core inflation has been reluctant to decline; the drop in food and regulated prices on the local market has been less than what would be consistent with the performance of international markets; and there have been some particularly pronounced increases in the exchange rate during the last two weeks, which could generate less confidence in the Colombian peso.",
        "A 50 bp cut was considered adequate in this context.",
        "A minority of the Board members felt that macroeconomic conditions allow and call for a more ambitious cut in the intervention interest rate, without risking the Board’s targets for inflation.",
        "A cut of 100 bp would send a loud signal to the productive sector at a time when expectations for growth and inflation are low.",
        "Finally, the Board reiterated the need to continue to monitor the international financial situation, so as to be ready to adopt whatever monetary-policy measures might be required to deal with its impact The Board of Directors agreed, by majority vote, to lower the Central Bank’s intervention interest rate by 50 bp, placing it at 9%.",

        "The annual variation in producer prices (PPI) declined from -1.5% in September to -4.7% in October Growth Most indicators of productive activity do not reflect a more profound slump in economic activity, but do not signal generalized growth either.",
        "The annual variation in the industrial production index, excluding coffee processing, was -3.8% in September.",
        "With this figure, the annual decline in industrial production during the third quarter came to 4.6%, a descent that compares favorably to the reductions observed during the last three quarters.",

        "This was more than the decline in previous months.",
        "Sales to the United States, which account for 38% of all exports, fell 20.3% during the year to date at September, due to fewer sales in dollars by the mining sector (-23.6%) and industry (-19%).",

        "Business sentiment in the industrialized countries also has continued to improve, as have certain indicators of productive activity, such as exports and retail sales.",
        "The international financial markets continued to recover, particularly with respect to liquidity conditions and stock market performance.",
        "This improvement in prospects has led international analysts to raise their forecasts for growth in 2010, particularly with respect to the United States.",
        "Even so, there is lingering uncertainty about how the economies of those countries will evolve.",
        "Specifically, the weak job market and the restrictions on bank loans could tone down the recovery in consumption and investment during the coming quarters.",

        "However, in the past month, the exchange rate stabilized in most Latin American countries and even depreciated, except in Chile, where appreciation continued Financial Variables The annual increase in M3, which had slowed up to -October, stabilized at around 10% in the last three weeks (from October 16 to November 6), largely due to liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR).",
        "The annual variation in cash, which posted an annual increase of 0.7% in October, recovered slightly and was 3.7% on November 6.",
        "In real terms (non- food CPI-deflated), the growth rates for M3, LSR and cash averaged 6.5%, 7.2% and 1.7%, respectively, during October.",

        "Corporate debt issue explains part of the slowdown in the commercial loan portfolio.",
        "With the figures at September, the commercial portfolio plus bonds grew 13.4%, which is 320 bp above the increase in the commercial loan portfolio.",
        "Another factor behind the slowdown in the domestic-currency denominated portfolio is associated with the increased in loan portfolio write- offs during the last 12 months, which went from COP5.5 t to COP7.5 t. As for interest rates, the 50 bp benchmark rate cut (September 25) was reflected entirely in the money market rates and has passed through quickly to rates on deposits and commercial loans (except for construction).",
        "Moreover, the reduction in the usury rate as of October 1 (206 bp) accelerated the decline in rates on credit card lending.",
        "The decline in average nominal rates during October was similar to the slowdown in non-food inflation; for that reason, interest rates in real terms remained relatively stable (with the exception of the credit rate, -116 bp and the consumer lending rate, -33 bp).",
        "Between October 23 and November 13, 2009, the short, middle and long segments of the TES yield declined by 45 bp, 111 bp and 70 bp, in that order AND The following points were emphasized by the Board of Directors during its deliberations: The sharp, rapid drop in price growth during the month, which was not anticipated by the market or in the Bank’s technical calculations.",
        "The continued decline in core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, which are within the target range set by the Board of Directors for next year.",
        "The generalized reduction in price increases compared to other months when reductions were due fundamentally to lower food and regulated prices.",
        "The temporary impact El Niño weather could have on price increases.",
        "The standstill in growth in consumer and business confidence indicators The recovery in M3 and, above all, in liabilities subject to reserve requirements The financial system’s peso loan portfolio, which is declining but still continues to grow in excess of nominal GDP Bond issues to supplement financing for the productive sector How market interest rates have performed in response to the benchmark rate cuts by the Central Bank.",
        "Less economic growth in Venezuela this year and the outlook for 2010 The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and growth in the tradable sectors The evolution of interest rates on government bonds The main points analyzed by the members of the Board centered on: (i) the elements that affect the inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010, particularly an eventual surge in food and regulated prices due to El Niño weather; (ii) the lag between monetary policy measures and their effect on production and prices; (iii) forecasts for economic growth during the remainder of the year and in 2010, given weaker-than-anticipated external demand and less fiscal stimulus next year; (iv) the sharp drop in exports to Venezuela during recent months and in Venezuela’s output; (v) the evolution of the exchange rate in recent weeks; (vi) the performance of monetary aggregates and how it might affect economic recovery; (vii) the recent low momentum in the commercial loan portfolio held by the financial system and its causes; (viii) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context of economic slowdown and falling inflation; (ix) the relevance of continuing to lower the intervention rate, given the latest data at hand; and (x) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations to the long-term target.",
        "The Board of Directors emphasized the following with respect to the way inflation performed during the month: (i) annual consumer inflation in October declined faster than expected; (ii) the core inflation indicators continued to drop; (iii) inflation expectations continue to fall; (iv) although the downturn in inflation was led by food and regulated prices, the monthly price reductions have been more generalized, encompassing a wide variety of goods and services; and (v) forecasts for the end of the year show inflation will be under the -point of the long-term target range (3%).",
        "It was noted that the external context has improved in recent months, prompting international analysts to raise their economic growth forecasts for 2010 in most countries and particularly in the United States.",
        "However, the growth forecasts for Venezuela show a sizeable reduction in GDP for this year and in 2010.",
        "Coupled with the added restrictions on trade, this will affect Colombian exports to that country.",
        "Moreover, although the information available at September reflects no new contractions in the country’s levels of economic activity, neither does it show vigorous recovery.",
        "Added to this is the continued slowdown in the portion of the loan portfolio denominated in domestic currency.",
        "Colombia’s expansive monetary policy has allowed for a steady reduction in interest rates on deposits and lending.",
        "The Board of Directors expects this tendency to continue to stimulate economic growth in an environment characterized by a healthy financial system.",
        "The majority of the Board members believe a 50 basis point reduction in the intervention rate will reinforce economic recovery and will reduce the negative effects of the slump in trade with Venezuela.",
        "This cut in the intervention rate corrects the real interest rate increase caused by less inflation and expectations of inflation and is coherent with the inflation target set for 2010.",
        "Other members of the Board expressed fear concerning the extemporaneous nature of the measure, given the natural lag between its adoption and its full impact on demand.",
        "They indicated a new interest rate cut might make it difficult to meet the inflation target for 2010 and, if so, the Board would have to increase its intervention rate in an environment where the economic recovery might not have been consolidated The Board of Directors agreed, by a majority vote, to lower the Central Bank’s intervention rate by 50 bp, placing it at 3.5%.",
        "OF THE DE LA OF ’S ON 18, 2009 On December 18, 2009 the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica was held in the city of Bogota.",

        "Annual inflation in producer prices (PPI) declined from 2.7% in June to 1.4% in July Growth The information at hand suggests the annual decline in economic activity during the second quarter was close to what it was in the first quarter.",
        "This is consistent with the projection by the Central Bank’s technical team.",

        "The decline in export value for traditional items (US$2.690b) was due mainly to coffee (-22.5%), crude oil and petroleum derivatives (-40.0%) and ferronickel (-39.4%).",
        "In the case of coffee, the contraction was the result of less export volume, while the decline in other products was primarily a question of lower prices.",
        "The biggest slowdown in the value of traditional exports originated with the U market.",
        "During 2009 to June, non-traditional exports to Venezuela in dollars, which account for 36% of all non-traditional exports, saw a 4% decline as a result of 13.6% fewer industrial sales.",

        "In terms of volume, all imports were down.",

        "On August 7, the loan portfolio denominated in domestic currency showed an annual variation of 11.8%, due to the slowdown in commercial loan portfolio growth, which went from 20.6% to 15.3% during that same period.",

        "The performance of the inter-bank credit market Negative growth in the United States and less economic growth in Venezuela, Ecuador and other trading partners The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and growth in the tradable sectors The behavior of interest rates on government bonds Intermediate and long-term expectations for inflation The main points of discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010, particularly an eventual rise in food prices; (ii) the lag between monetary policy measures and their impact on production and prices; (iii) the uncertainty in world markets due to the financial crisis and its impact on the Colombian economy; (iv) the region’s access to external financing, direct investment flows, and the reasons for recent limited growth in the loan portfolio held by the financial system; (v) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where the economy is slowing and inflation is falling; (vi) the relevance of continuing to lower the intervention rate, given the latest data; and (viii) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations to the long-term target.",
        "The members of the Board highlighted the drop in annual consumer inflation for the ninth straight month to 3.28% in July.",
        "Once again, the reduction was due to food and regulated prices, while the core inflation indicators continued to decline.",
        "The reduced inflationary pressures continued as a result of several factors; namely, weak internal and external demand, lower inflation expectations, which are near the upper limit of the long-term target range set by the Board (between 2% and 4%) and the decline in commodity prices compared to the high point in 2008.",
        "As a result, the Board expects annual inflation to end the year below the lower limit of the target range (4.5%).",
        "The world economy is stabilizing.",
        "Slow economic recovery is expected for the second half of the year, and the forecasts for growth in 2010 have improved.",
        "Most of the Latin American economies continue to experience a moderate slowdown and lower inflation.",
        "Thanks to the reduction in the Central Bank’s intervention rate and less demand for credit, interest rates on deposit-taking and lending have declined steadily.",
        "The Board of Directors expects the reduction in interest rates to continue and to stimulate economic growth.",
        "The performance of financial system is healthy and the productive sector has floated several large bond issues to supplement credit from the financial system.",
        "In addition, business and consumer confidence indicators continue to point towards an improvement during the second half of the year.",
        "The latest results for industry, commerce and construction are in line with year-end growth forecast by the Bank’s technical team.",
        "Several Board members said they preferred to hold the intervention rate steady, citing a variety of reasons.",
        "Namely, (i) the stance of the country’s monetary policy is expansionist; (ii) the Colombian economy, unlike that of other countries, has not suffered a financial crisis that justifies extreme policy measures and abnormally low interest rates; (iii) part of the reduction in consumer inflation, especially the drop in annual food inflation, may involve elements that are temporary; (iv) the weight of external factors in the explanation for the country’s economic slowdown is such that lower interest rates probably would not have much of a positive impact on productive activity; (v) the figures on loan portfolio growth suggest it is affected not by liquidity problems, but by limited momentum in the credit market; and (vi) the current stance of monetary policy makes the stability in interest rates compatible with the decline in inflation towards its long-term targets.",
        "Other Board members proposed lowering the Bank’s intervention rate by 25 or 50 basis points, inasmuch as the forecasts for this year indicate inflation will be below the lower limit of the target range for 2009, while the drop in 2010 will be more than was anticipated initially.",
        "One of those directors emphasized the measure also is justified because: (i) there is a growing negative output gap, as reflected by the continued decline in economic activity and higher unemployment; (ii) the trade risks to Colombia posed by Venezuela and Ecuador are growing; and (iii) peso appreciation is pronounced and among the highest in the region, more than that of our major competitors The Board of Directors decided, by a majority vote, to hold the Central Bank’s intervention rate steady at 4.5%.",

        "The information at hand shows signs of recovery in expectations among business people and consumers, even though internal economic activity remains weak: The DANE figures on industrial production at April show -14.5% growth that month.",
        "This sharp drop was due, in part, to fewer working days in April 2009 compared to the year before, because of Easter Week.",
        "The Fedesarrollo Consumer Opinion Survey (EOE: Spanish acronym) for industry in April shows a drop in the indicators for orders and inventories compared to the levels reported the month before.",

        "The Fedesarrollo EOE for industry and commerce in April shows that business people in these sectors have better expectations for production and sales during the next three months.",
        "This, in turn, occasioned a break in the downward tendency in these variables.",
        "The Fedesarrollo Consumer Confidence Indicator registered an important increase in May and recovered from the extremely low level observed in April.",
        "The trade balance in the first quarter of 2009 showed a deficit of USD11 million, in contrast to a surplus of USD342 registered a year earlier.",
        "This was due to the fact that the drop in exports (13.2%) exceeded the drop in imports (-9.5%).",
        "The annual decline in export value (USD1,144 m) during the first three months of the year is explained largely by fewer sales of oil and petroleum derivative to the U market.",
        "Sales to that market, which account for 31% of all exports, fell by 26.8%.",
        "Exports to Venezuela represent nearly 20% of the total and rose 4.1% due to an increase in sales of beef, fuel and boilers.",
        "FOB imports between January and April totaled USD 10,058 and experienced an annual reduction of 12.5%.",
        "In CIF terms, they came to USD 10,640 and were down by -13.3%.",
        "Intermediate goods and raw materials acquired in the United States, especially mining, chemical and pharmaceutical products, registered the most significant drop in total purchases External Context Following the dramatic downturn in the world economy during the last few months, several indicators of household and business sentiment show signs of improvement.",
        "Moreover, the sharp inventory reduction observed in GDP in the United States suggests a change in economic performance during the second half of the year.",
        "As for the emerging market economies, the recovery in industrial production in China and India, along with certain signs of a recovery in exports from other Asian countries, have been an incentive to commodity purchases and have improved the sentiment in capital markets.",
        "Nevertheless, economic activity continues to decline in most countries.",
        "In Latin America in particular, the first quarter of 2009 saw a sharp drop in Mexico and contraction in Brazil and Chile, although not as dramatic.",
        "Peru would have experienced growth, but at less of a rate than the year before.",
        "The decline in demand and lower commodity prices compared to the levels observed a year ago have helped to lower inflation within the region, particularly in Chile, Colombia and Peru.",
        "This, in turn, coupled with better expectations for inflation, has facilitated additional interest rate cuts by the central banks.",
        "However, some market rates, especially those for consumer lending, have yet to react in line with the monetary stimulus.",
        "During the last three months, the region’s major currencies have appreciated against the dollar and are reaching the levels observed a year ago with respect to the euro.",
        "This offset the depreciation witnessed between January and February.",
        "The build-up in the major Latin American currencies has occurred in the context of a weakening dollar against the other hard currencies and less risk perception with respect to the emerging countries Financial Variables In May, M3 and liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR) registered 16% annual growth, following the temporary slowdown observed in April.",
        "That slowdown and the subsequent recovery were related to the accumulation of National Treasury deposits with the Central Bank of Colombia in April and the draw on May 15 to cover COP$4 trillion in TES that fell due.",
        "Another COP$6 trillion in TES are set to mature in July.",
        "Annual growth in the loan portfolio in domestic currency came to 15% in May, which is similar to the increase observed during the previous quarter.",
        "As to the different types of loans, the slowdown in the consumer portfolio continued; its nominal annual growth at May was 3.9%.",
        "However, the balance of consumer loans has stabilized at around COP$39.4 trillion since March of this year.",
        "The reduced speed of consumer lending contrasts with the added expansion in commercial loans.",
        "The commercial loan portfolio registered an annual increase of nearly 21% by May, with the momentum in disbursements on ordinary, preferential and treasury loans being particularly important.",
        "The loan portfolio in foreign currency with local intermediaries declined by COP$1,087 during the course of the year to May.",
        "Direct external lending was up US$279 by April.",
        "The Central Bank’s interest rate cuts (500 bp) passed through quickly to the inter-bank market, to deposits and to commercial lending; however, in the case of household loans, the pass-through has been slower.",
        "At the end of May, the interbank rate (6.00%) and the IBR (6.04%) were in line with the benchmark interest rate.",
        "Moreover, from the onset of the rate reduction policy (December 19, 2008) up until the last week of May 2009, the DTF rate fell by 408 bp to 6.11%.",
        "The decline in rates on ordinary consumer lending between the same dates also has been significant (-443bp), having gone from 17.75% to 13.32%.",
        "The drop in interest rates on consumer and mortgage loans during the same period was less (-134 bp and -159bp in the same order).",
        "Those rates ended May at 24.20% and 15.73%, respectively.",
        "When discounting non-food inflation from the interest rates on savings and loans, the results also show an important reduction.",
        "Real average DTF and lending rates (according to the method used by the Central Bank) declined by 305bp and 362bp, respectively, between December 2008 and May 2009.",
        "In May, they were 1.72% and 8.38%, in that order.",
        "The interest rate on short-term TES declined in line with the benchmark rate.",
        "The rates on longer term TES have seen less of a reduction.",
        "Between December 19, 2008 and May 29, 2009 the TES zero coupon curve registered respective reductions of 395bp, 228bp and 162bp in the one, five and 10-year tranches AND The following points were emphasized by the Board during its deliberations: The pace of price hikes and its steady decline The drop in food inflation and in non-tradable inflation excluding food and regulated prices International prices for food, raw materials and oil, which could have a major impact on total inflation, depending on the country’s trade policy and how the exchange rate performs Better expectations, despite weak economic activity Growth in the peso loan portfolio in the financial system due to the commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, the mortgage loan portfolio The rapid decline in most interest rates in the market in response to the Bank’s benchmark rate cuts.",
        "Negative growth in the United States and less economic growth in Venezuela, Ecuador and the economies of other trading partners The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and growth in the tradable sectors The rise in interest rates on government bonds Intermediate and long-term expectations for inflation The main points of the discussion among the Board members centered on: (i) the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010, including the indexing mechanisms incorporated into certain prices; (ii) the lag between monetary policy measures and their impact on production and prices; (iii) the uncertainty generated in international markets by the world financial crisis and its impact on the Colombian economy; (iv) the region’s access to external financing, direct investment flows, and the reasons for limited momentum in the loan portfolio in the financial system; (v) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where the economy is slowing and inflation is falling; (vi) the relevance of continuing to lower the intervention rate, given the latest data; (vii) the recent increase in medium and long-term expectations for inflation; and (viii) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations to the long-term target.",
        "The members of the Board underscored the fact that annual consumer inflation (4.77%) declined for the seventh month in a row.",
        "Again, this was a case of food prices, in addition to non-tradable goods and regulated prices.",
        "The core inflation indicators continued to decline.",
        "The price pattern ratifies the fact that weak internal and external demand, expectations for inflation and the drop in commodity prices compared to the high point in 2008 are reflected in less inflationary pressure.",
        "The Board expects annual inflation to drop sharply in June and to end the year below the midpoint of the target range (5%).",
        "Several indicators of expectations in the industrialized economies changed for the better, which suggests they could be stabilizing.",
        "The recovery of production in China and India, together with certain signs of a recovery in exports from other Asian countries, have stimulated commodity purchases and improved performance on the capital markets.",
        "However, the negative effects of the world crisis are expected to continue throughout the year.",
        "Most Latin American economies saw a contraction in output growth during the early months of 2009, together with a pronounced drop in inflation.",
        "The sharp devaluation in Latin American currencies witnessed at the start of 2009 has been corrected in a context marked by a weak dollar and less perception of risk with respect to the emerging market economies.",
        "The international crisis has affected Colombia mostly by dampening consumer and producer expectations and slowing the momentum in exports and remittances.",
        "Business and consumer expectations reveal signs of recovery for the second half of the year, even though economic activity remains weak.",
        "Lending continues to grow at a good pace, fueled largely by commercial borrowing, while the performance of the financial system remains healthy.",
        "The Board of Directors expects interest rates on commercial and household loans to continue to fall.",
        "Several Board members indicated they preferred to leave the intervention interest rate unchanged or to cut it by 25 bp, based on the following considerations.",
        "Unlike other countries, Colombia has not suffered a financial crisis that justifies extreme policy measures and unusually low interest rates.",
        "Moreover, given the significant weight of external factors in the explanation for the slowdown in the country’s economic growth, lower interest rates probably would not have a major positive impact on productive activity.",
        "In addition, medium and long-term expectations for inflation registered an increase during the past month.",
        "If that increase persists, monetary policy would have to react accordingly.",
        "Other members voiced their preference for a 50 bp cut in the intervention interest rate and an announcement to the effect that, with the data at hand, no further changes in that rate are anticipated in the near future.",
        "The latter takes into account the delayed effect of a cumulative reduction of 550 bp in the intervention rate on economic growth during the remainder of the year and in 2010, the recent pattern in medium and long-term expectations for inflation, and the fact that part of the reduction in inflation is the result of a temporary shock in food prices.",
        "The members agreed the sharp increase in money supply, the reduced variation in food and regulated prices, a less negative external environment and the added momentum in works suggest a gradual recovery in economic growth as of the second half of the year.",
        "Moreover, they agree the stance of the country’s monetary policy makes it possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation towards its long-term targets.",
        "Given the foregoing, the members of the Board decided to lower the Central Bank’s intervention rate to 4.5%.",
        "This implies a reduction of 50 bp The Board of Directors agreed to reduce the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates by 50 bp and to announce that, given the data now available, no additional changes in that rate are expected in the near future.",
        "This decision places the Bank’s intervention interest rate at 4.5%",
        "Minutes of a Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia on October 23, 2009 A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia was held in the city of Bogotá on October 23, 2009.",
        "Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Cesar Vallejo Mr. Juan Pablo Zárate Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main issues addressed during the meeting Annual consumer inflation in September was 3.21%, which is 8 bp more than in August.",
        "Accumulated inflation during the course of the year up to September is 2.12%, which is well below the rate posted last year (6.53%).",
        "The core inflation indicators continued to decline.",
        "Annual food inflation rose from 1.46% in August to 2.2% in September.",
        "The annual increase in the price of regulated items dropped from 3.5% in August to 2.5% in September, thanks to fuel and public utility prices.",
        "Annual inflation in non-tradable items, excluding food and regulated prices, declined from 4.9% in August to 4.8% in September.",
        "Particularly striking was the drop in items with low indexing and in rentals.",
        "The annual variation in the price of highly-indexed items remained at around 7%.",
        "The annual increase in the price of tradable goods, without food and regulated prices, dropped from 2.8% in August to 2.7% in September.",
        "With the preliminary data available at October 20, inflation expectations based on government bonds negotiated at one, five and 10 years showed variations of 88 bp, 1 bp and -50 bp compared to the average figures for September, and were 3.71%, 4.55% and 4.58%, respectively.",
        "The annual variation in producer prices (PPI) went from 1% in August to -1.5% in September Growth Most indicators of productive activity registered less of an annual decline during the third quarter of the year, but showed no signs of a significant increase in their levels.",
        "According to the figures released by DANE, industrial production in August of this year was 3.3% less than in August 2008.",
        "This is favorable compared to the situation in past months.",
        "In terms of levels, industrial production (seasonally adjusted) was down in August with respect to July.",
        "However, the same series adjusted by the number of working days showed a higher outcome for August compared to July.",
        "ANDI reported that IPI growth during the course of the year to August (-7.5%) would have declined, despite being at a better level than in July (- 8.1%).",
        "It is important to point out that there have been considerable discrepancies between DANE’s series and those released by ANDI, specifically with respect to year-to-date growth rates and trends.",
        "The total demand for energy (both regulated and unregulated) was up 3.0% in September in annual terms.",
        "During the third quarter, this indicator posted a 2.2% annual increase, which is better than in the first and second quarters (0.8% and 0.3%, respectively).",
        "The level of building permits increased during July and August.",
        "Real retail sales levels rose during the period from May until August and the annual slowdown has declined (-0.9% annual in August compared to - 3.7% in July).",
        "The Fedesarollo consumer confidence indicator fell slightly in September with respect to August, but the average for the third quarter was higher than the average for the quarter before.",
        "During the course of the year until August, the country had a trade surplus of US$874 , which is less than the surplus a year ago (US$1.112 b).",
        "This is the result of 19.4% fewer exports, which is more than the drop in imports (-16.5%).",
        "At a monthly level, the trade balance in August posted a US$260 surplus, thanks to trade surpluses with the United States, Venezuela and Ecuador.",
        "During 2009 up to August, total exports in dollars (CIIU classification) fell 19.4% with respect to the same period in 2008.",
        "Industry was down 22.1%, the mining sector -17.2% and farming -12.1%.",
        "In spite of these reductions, the levels were close to those for the same period in 2007, with the exception of the mining sector, which has improved with respect to that year.",
        "Total exports in dollars to Venezuela, which account for 16%, are down 9.8% so far this year, primarily due to industrial sales (-12.5%).",
        "Sales to Venezuela during August declined -45.7% compared to the same month in 2008.",
        "This is more of a reduction than in past months.",
        "Sales to the United States, which accounts for 38% of total exports, declined 22.5%, during the course of the year up to August.",
        "This is the largest contraction among Colombia’s trading partners and originates with fewer exports in dollars from the mining sector (26.2%) and the industrial sector (19.7%).",
        "During the course of 2009 up to August, imports (CIF) came to US$21.293 b, having fallen 17.4% in annual terms.",

        "However, the labor supply (GPR) grew even more.",
        "The result was an increase in the unemployment rate (UR), which was 11.9% nationwide for the moving quarter ended in August and 13% in the 13 areas External Context Economic conditions in the developed countries have improved during the last few months, thanks to the actions taken by governments and central Banks.",
        "These initiatives made it possible: (i) to improve liquidity conditions and to stabilize the interbank markets by reducing risk perception; (ii) to reinforce consumer and business expectations; and (iii) to avoid an even larger slump in economic activity.",
        "The emerging economies also showed signs of recovery, particularly the Asian economies.",

        "For Colombia’s major trading partners in the region, 2010 is expected to be a better year, although the forecasts are less optimistic in the case of Venezuela and Ecuador.",
        "The recovery in China and in several other Asian economies has rekindled the demand for commodities so far this year.",
        "Coupled with a weak dollar, this has sustained commodity prices, favoring terms of trade in the case of the Latin American countries.",
        "The Latin American currencies continue to appreciate, particularly those of Brazil and Colombia.",
        "Since March 2009, the Colombian peso has appreciated against most currencies Financial Variables The annual nominal increase in the monetary base during September was 6.1% compared to an annual rate of 15.3% the month before.",
        "This slowdown is explained by less of an increase in bank reserves due to a statistical effect associated with the sharp increase during September 2008 due to the increase in the bank reserve requirement and the increased perception of risk in the financial system sparked by the failure of Lehman Brothers.",
        "The last few months also saw fewer liabilities subject to reserve requirements (LSR).",
        "The LSR decline may be related to the slowdown in economic activity and to a shift in agents’ portfolio towards government bonds.",
        "As a result, the broadest monetary aggregate – M3 – also experienced a slowdown, which was more pronounced during the early days of October.",
        "The annual increase in M3 went from 13.2% to 9.7% between early August and October 9, while the increase in LSR went from 14.0% to 10.2%.",

        "In August, total external borrowing (direct lending from the private productive sector, plus the banks’ portfolio in foreign currency) dropped 8.1% in annual terms (compared to 6.2% the month before).",
        "However, despite the negative annual rates, direct external borrowing was up compared to the level in July.",

        "All monthly average nominal interest rates on deposits-taking and lending declined during the past month.",
        "The 50 bp policy rate cut by the BDCB on September 25 was passed through entirely to the money market rates (TIB).",
        "The rates on deposit-taking and commercial loans, consumer lending and mortgage loans declined as well.",
        "Moreover, the usury rate reduction led to a drop in the interest rate on credit card lending.",
        "Despite the cut in nominal rates, real rates were up due to the reduction in non-food inflation.",
        "The short, middle and long segments of the TES curve posted respective reductions of 42 bp, 47 bp and 49 bp AND The following points were emphasized by the Board of Directors during its deliberations: The pace of price growth and its downward trend The variation in food prices, which continues to be low The effect international prices for food, raw materials and oil could have on total inflation How the El Niño phenomenon could affect the increase in prices The continued improvement in consumer and business confidence compared to the first half of the year The decline in monetary aggregates, particularly M3 The peso loan portfolio held by the financial system, which continues to grow in excess of nominal GDP, even though it is declining Bond issues that have supplemented productive sector financing How market interest rates have performed in response to the Central Bank’s benchmark rate cuts.",

        "The Board of Directors decided to adopt the 2% to 4% range as the long-term target for inflation in 2010, with 3% as the specific target for legal effects.",
        "This range is the long-term target set years ago by the Board of Directors.",
        "The members of the Board believe economic conditions allow for future inflation to be within the long-term target range, which would help to anchor inflation expectations at that level.",
        "Low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to sustained growth in the economy and employment and the nation’s competiveness.",
        "The inflation target that was adopted takes the following into account: Inflation near 3% by the end of the year, due to the drop in commodity prices during 2009 and the fact that internal and external demand has been seriously weakened as a result of international financial crisis.",
        "Expectations of slow growth in the world economy during 2010 and 2011, and the downward trend in global inflation Recent developments in international commodity prices, the demand for Colombia’s leading exports in a context of low economic growth with respect to our trading partners, and possible future supply shocks to food and regulated prices.",
        "The delayed effect of the Board’s expansionist monetary policy, the forecasts produced by the inflation models, and agents’ expectations for inflation.",
        "The Board decided to hold the base interest rate for repo auctions at 4% and believes the inflation target for 2010 will be met without upward pressure from the intervention interest rate in the near future.",
        "It also agreed to supply a larger portion of permanent liquidity to meet the liquidity needs that usually increase at year’s end.",
        "To do so, the Central Bank will purchase three billion pesos in TES on the secondary market and foreign currency.",
        "Some directors expressed concern about the decline in monetary aggregates and lending, and its possible connection to economic performance.",
        "They indicated the pattern in monetary aggregates and lending may be a reflection of added risk perception, given weaker than expected productive activity.",
        "Accordingly, they warned of the need to closely track monetary aggregates and lending, as well as their possible impact on the stance of monetary policy The Board of Directors decided to make no change in the Central Bank’s intervention interest rate, which was left at 4%.",

        "Non-tradable inflation, without food and regulated prices, went from 5.25% in December to 5.1% in January.",
        "Rentals were an important item and have exhibited an upward tendency in the last five months, largely due to the clauses in rental contracts to compensate for the effects of inflation.",
        "For its part, tradable inflation, without food and regulated prices, registered no change and remained at 2.4%.",
        "The various inflation-expectation indicators measured on the basis of local government bonds at 5 and 10 years fell below 5%, while those measured with one-year TES were at 5.6%, which is slightly over the top of the target range set by the Board of Directors.",

        "The Fenalco retail sales indicator, which discounts seasonality in commerce, showed a drop in January with respect to November and December.",
        "The total demand for energy for consumption and production was up by only 1% in January compared to the same month in 2008.",
        "The Fedesarrollo indicator of consumer sentiment rose somewhat in January, but is still below the levels observed during the last five years.",
        "As to the external sector, total exports in dollars rose at an annual rate of 30.8% between January and November 2008, with traditional exports outdoing non-traditional exports (48.3% versus 9.0% growth).",

        "The discussion among Board members centered primarily on: (i) the effect of monetary-policy measures, given the time it takes them to work through to the economy; (ii) the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010; (iii) how inflation in the short term might affect prices and wages in 2009; (iv) projections on the current account deficit; (v) the uncertainty the world financial crisis has sparked on international markets and how it affects the Colombian economy; (vi) depreciation of the peso against the dollar in recent weeks; (vii) the region’s access to external financing, the decline in long-term interest rates, and the reduced momentum in the loan portfolio held by the financial system; (viii) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where the economy is slowing faster than expected; and (ix) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations.",

        "The drop was more than expected and included most of the items in the family market basket, particularly the food group.",
        "The core inflation indicators also were down in February, and inflation expectations were within the target range set by the Board (5%+/- 1/2 percentage point).",
        "The decline in inflation and expectations of inflation confirms the fact that weak internal and external demand and the drop in international commodity prices are translating into less inflationary pressure.",
        "The Board is now more confident that annual inflation will continue to decline in the coming months and will be within the target range by the end of the year.",
        "Available figures show the outlook for the world economy remains negative, despite the sharply expansive policies countries have adopted.",
        "The figures also confirm that productive activity in Colombia has slowed.",
        "The latest data on industry and commerce continue to show major reductions.",
        "Added to this is the impact further deterioration in economic activity worldwide has had on productive activity through fewer exports and lower terms of trade, declining confidence and more costly capital flows.",
        "Given the current situation, which is characterized by declining inflation and fewer expectations of inflation, the Board of Directors believes the time is right to lower the intervention rate at a faster pace than the one adopted in the past two months, without affecting the credibility of the Central Bank’s monetary policy.",
        "It emphasized that the loss of momentum in productive activity, which is reflected in higher unemployment, is greater than expected and that other central banks in the region also are adopting more expansive monetary policies to support demand and future growth in their economies.",
        "Although they agreed to a reduction in the intervention interest rate, several members warned about the risks associated with a faster change in the policy rate than was agreed on at previous Board meetings.",
        "Given the instability of international and local financial markets, they believe the Bank’s intervention interest rate should be cut in a way that focuses on credibility and the confidence of agents in the economy.",
        "An interest rate cut that is not credible can affect the exchange market, the government bond market and future expectations of inflation, all of which could make it difficult for the Board to continue to pursue an anti-cyclical monetary policy.",
        "Nevertheless, the members of the Board agreed, by consensus, to reduce the intervention rate at a faster pace than the one adopted at previous meetings, but without this implying similar cuts in the future.",
        "Therefore, monetary policy and peso devaluation will help to support demand and future economic growth to the extent that they do not jeopardize the inflation targets.",
        "Lastly, the Board reiterated the need to continue to monitor the international financial situation in order to ensure that whatever monetary policy measures might be needed to address its impact can be adopted at the proper time The Board of Directors agreed to cut the Central Bank’s intervention interest rates by 100 b This places its intervention rate at 8%."

        "In contrast, mining and industry exhibited significant contractions The information available for the third quarter is still scarce, and does not allow determining a forecast for GDP growth with certainty.",
        "However, some indicators suggest that performance of the economic activity during this period would be better than the one registered a year ago Regarding the labor market, data to June show a slight correction of the unemployment rate nationwide, but an increasing trend since over a year for that of the thirteen areas In real terms, household credit during the second quarter of 2017 grew 8.8%, while commercial indebtedness continued to stagnate.",
        "The interest rates on commercial loans (exception for construction) have registered falls that are higher than the one for the policy rate.",
        "Transmission towards interest rates on household loans has been lower.",

        "However, Colombia’s trading partners in the region continue to exhibit low performance of their economic activity.",
        "With this information, the technical staff kept its growth forecast for Colombia’s trading partners unchanged Regarding the price of oil, in recent weeks, the news about lower inventories in the United States and on commitments for lower production by some members of OPEC appear to have contributed to stabilize prices close to the forecast of the technical staff (USD $51/barrel Brent reference) With this, the technical staff at the Central Bank maintained its growth forecast for 2017 at 1.6%, within a range between 1.0% and 2.0% Inflation stood at 3.4% on a yearly basis in June, registering a 59 bp dropvis-à-visJune.",
        "All major groups contributed to this fall, particularly tradables and regulated in the sub-group of non-food inflation.",
        "In the group of food inflation, perishable and processed foods stand out.",
        "It is worth noting that, due to the basis of statistical comparison and to the normal agricultural cycle, the downward trend in annual food inflation could revert in the following months Inflation expectations to December 2017 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts lowered, posting at 4.16%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those derived from public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to a year increased slightly, standing between 3.5% and 3.8% In all, for 2017, the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target are expected to continue fading in an environment of a weaker-than-expected economic activity.",
        "Monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target  AND OPTIONSThe Board Members highlighted the latest data on inflation, which have been better than expected.",

        "The members of the majoritarian group felt that there is space for a 25 bp cut, given the weak dynamics of the economic activity despite the recovery expected for the second half of the year, and an inflationary inertia that has caused the fall in core inflation to be slower than that for headline inflation.",
        "With this reduction, they mentioned, the rate could already be on neutral ground, according to some calculations.The remaining two members considered that the weakness of economic activity deserves a stronger counter-cyclical response, since the output gap is very wide and the results in terms of inflation have been good.",
        "They consider inflation will continue converging to its target, as it has done up to now, and what is relevant at this time is to provide a greater stimulus to the recovery of growth.One member of the Board voted in favor of maintaining the intervention rate unchanged.",
        "S/he highlighted the risks that still persist in terms of inflationary inertia.",

        "With this, on the demand side, growth in 2017 would be more balanced than the one observed in 2016.As for inflation, it stood at 4.69% on a yearly basis in March, while core inflation, measured as the average of the four indicators monitored by the Central Bank, continued with no significant changes.While most of the deceleration in the month is explained by the behavior of food, the decline in inflation of tradables (excluding food and regulated items) suggests that the upward effect of the tax reform and the Liquor Act would have taken place, for the most part, in the first months of the year.",
        "The acceleration in non-tradable inflation (excluding food and regulated) suggests that the indexation of prices and wages may be gaining importance.Inflation expectations by economic analysts and those obtained from the quarterly survey of economic expectations to December 2017, to twelve and twenty-four months decreased.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds to two years and over continue their downward trend.As for the external context, the information available for the first quarter suggests that the economies of the United States and the euro zone could have slowed down in the first quarter.",

        "Capital inflows to fixed income continued in March.",
        "The currencies of these countries have continued with a trend towards appreciation.Colombia's terms of trade would have continued at levels higher than a year ago, thanks to the increase in the price of the main commodities exported by the country (particularly oil and coal).",
        "As for oil, although there have been significant fluctuations in its price, so far this year it has remained above USD $50 per barrel (Brent).In all, for 2017, it is expected that the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade, in an environment of a slightly weaker economic activity than forecast in the previous quarterly report.",
        "The monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target AND OPTIONSIn discussing the policy options, the members of the Board of Directors agreed on the following aspects:The Colombian economy has shown an orderly adjustment in the face of strong shocks in the past years, which has been reflected in the existence of excess installed capacity.The information available from the last month continues to show an increasing weakness of economic activity, which led the technical staff to reduce the 2017 growth forecast to 1.8% as the most likely figure.Inflation expectations and observed inflation declined in the last month.",
        "However, their decline is due, in good part, to a reduction in the annual variation in food prices.",
        "The indexation mechanisms and the increase in the persistence of inflation were reflected in the increase of the variation in prices of non-tradable goods.The current level of the real policy interest rate continues to be contractionary.",
        "With the reduction in inflation expectations that took place last month, the current level of the intervention rate is even more contractionary.Given the above, and facing the risk balance, all Board Members deemed appropriate to reduce the intervention rate, but with differences as to the amount of the reduction.Four members considered advisable to reduce it by 50 basis points.",
        "They felt that this reduction is consistent with the new information regarding the lower growth of the economy, the reduction in inflation expectations, and the expected path of decline in inflation to reach the 3.0% target in 2018.Other Board Members voted for a 25 bp reduction.",
        "They argued that there are reasons to reduce the benchmark interest rate, such as the behavior of inflation expectations and the indicators of real activity.",
        "However, the persistence of high levels of inflation and high indexing still exhibited by the economy indicate that the path of reductions in the benchmark interest rate should be gradual, prudent, and moderate, if the desired objectives of the Central Bank are to be met in the policy horizon.",

        "However, unlike the previous year, the adjustment took place by an increase in revenues (mainly by mining exports) rather than by a reduction of outflows.The information available for the second quarter suggests that the Colombian economy would have exhibited a low expansion, similar to that of the first three months of the year.",

        "Foreign trade would have contributed negatively to GDP growth.On the other hand, banking credit to companies continues to decline, while the one granted to households has also reduced its growth rate in the last few weeks.",
        "This takes place within a context in which the transmission of the reduction in the benchmark rate has been higher to commercial credit rates than to household credit rates.As for the labor market, with figures to April, there is a growing trend in the unemployment rate and stagnation in employment for the 13 areas, while the national total unemployment rate has remained stable, and the number of jobs continues to grow, albeit at low rates.In the external context, the Federal Reserve of the United States increased its benchmark interest rate, placing it between 1.0% and 1.25%.",

        "Partners in the region maintain a very low dynamism.There has been a downward trend in oil prices in recent weeks due to the news of higher inventories and to increases of production in countries which are not members of OPEC.With this, downside risks, incorporated into the forecast range for GDP growth of the previous quarterly report (between 0.8% and 2.6%, with 1.8% as the most likely figure) seem to be materializing.In May, yearly inflation posted at 4.37%.",
        "This reduction is explained by the behavior of food prices, tradable goods excluding food and regulated items, and regulated items.",
        "Non-tradable goods generated upward pressures, particularly leases, which have a high degree of indexation to past inflation.Inflation expectations derived from the monthly survey to financial analysts applied in June exhibited a path slightly lower than the one obtained in the survey in May.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds also declined for most terms.In all, for 2017, the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target are expected to continue fading in an environment of a weak economic activity.",
        "The monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target  AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed that the information published since the previous meeting of the Board of Directors shows that deterioration of the productive activity has been more pronounced than had been anticipated.",

        "By components, the slowdown is explained by a lower dynamism of gross capital formation, while total consumption grew at rates similar to those in the previous quarter.By branches of activity, the sectors that continue contributing the most to growth in this quarter were agriculture and financial services.",
        "In contrast, mining, building construction and industry showed significant contractions.The information available for the fourth quarter is still scarce; however, some indicators suggest that the performance of economic activity during said period shall be slightly inferior to that observed in the third quarter, but superior to the figures from the first half of the year.Regarding the labor market, the information to September shows increases in the unemployment rate on a national level and for the thirteen most important metropolitan areas.",
        "For this last geographic domain, the unemployment rate completed more than a year with an upward trend.Nominal credit growth accelerated slightly in October (7.4%), driven by the recovery in the commercial portfolio.",

        "Thus, Colombia´s terms of trade to September remain at levels above the average level of 2016.With all the above, some downside risks on the growth forecast for 2017, which was estimated at 1.6% in the previous Report, would be materializing.Inflation to October increased, although below the expectations of the technical staff and the market, standing at 4.05% on a yearly basis.",

        "Conversely, data on the productive activity show that, although the economy is in a reactivation process, it is still very slow and far from the potential rate of GDP growth.",
        "Additionally, the external accounts show an improvement, owing both to the increase in the prices of commodities and to the already positive growth of the volume of exports, including non-mining products and services.Five of the seven Board Members voted for an additional reduction of the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "This outlook recognizes that inflation is moving in the direction of reaching the Central Bank´s target, and there is a slight improvement in the external gap, although there is still a significant expansion of the output gap.",
        "This is due, above all, to the weakness of domestic demand, as is reflected in the growth reduction of said variable in the third quartervis-à-visthe second quarter, and the weakness that consumer surveys reveal to the industry and to commerce in the available data for the current quarter.The other two members voted to maintain the policy rate unaltered.",
        "In their judgment, this outlook is consistent with what was announced during the last Board meeting that the 25 bp reduction should not be understood as a continuous path of cuts.",

        "Core inflation, measured as the average of the four indicators monitored by the Central Bank, continued with no significant changes.",
        "The available information suggests that, as happened last month, part of the observed increase in consumer prices was due to the impact of the tax reform (by the change in the VAT, the green tax, and the Liquor Act).Measures of inflation expectations by economic analysts to December 2017 and to 12 and 24 months lowered, as those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years.Regarding the external context, the most recent indicators for the advanced economies suggest improvement of their activity.",

        "His/her arguments focused on the increasing persistence of inflation that seems to be appearing in the Colombian economy.",
        "This factor, added to the supply shocks in recent years, suggests the desirability of maintaining a more contractionary monetary policy in order to ensure the early convergence of inflation to its target, thus avoiding damages to credibility that would cause this process to be more expensive in the future.",

        "This trend would continue in 2018, when a slight increase in the international prices of some of the main export products is also expected The most recent information on capital flows to emerging economies and the behavior of risk premia suggest that external financing would not exhibit significant changes in the rest of the year.",
        "However, in recent months, the expectations of a less expansionary monetary policy in developed economies has increased; consequently, it is estimated that external financing conditions for 2018 will be less generous than in previous years.",
        "This report assumes an increase in the FED’s policy rate in December 2017 and two more increases next year Forecasts suggest that the country's external deficit should continue correcting in the remainder of the year as a result of a better dynamics of exports of goods and the good performance of current transfers.",
        "Thus, a current account deficit close to 3.7% of GDP is estimated in 2017.",
        "A deficit of around 3.6% of GDP is forecast for the coming year, still above the country's historical average The information available on real activity in Colombia allows to confirm that the slowdown would have bottomed out during the first half of 2017.",
        "The indicators for the third quarter suggest an acceleration of the pace of GDP growth, mainly driven by investment and, to a lesser extent, by public consumption, as well as by a low basis for comparison in the same period last year As for credit, total indebtedness since March shows a relatively stable nominal growth (close to 6.0%).",

        "This comes as a result of a more dynamic external demand, of a good performance of public consumption, and a significant increase of works.",
        "Thus, for 2017, the technical staff maintained its estimation for GDP growth close to 1.6%, within a range between 1.3% and 1.9% For 2018, the technical staff increased its growth forecast from 2.4% to 2.7%, within a range between 1.5% and 3.5% In line with the expectations from the technical staff and the market, inflation increased in September, although less than expected, standing at 3.97% on a yearly basis.",
        "This acceleration is explained by the behavior of the groups of perishable food and regulated items.",
        "Contrastingly, the tradable sector, together with processed foods and meals outside the home, contributed to lower inflation.",

        "Monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlighted the good performance of inflation in the last months and the reduction of its forecast at different deadlines.",
        "This is based on the following considerations: (i) the figures for inflation in the last quarter have been lower than expected by the market and by the Central Bank's technical staff; (ii) the staff’s forecasts on this variable have declined, suggesting that it will be close to 4.0% by the end of 2017.",
        "Similarly, forecasts suggest that achieving the 3.0% target in 2018 is highly probable; and (iii) core inflation has continued to fall.Five Board Members voted in favor of a 25 bp reduction to the benchmark interest rate.",

        "In the view of these members, in this environment, with a widening of the excesses of installed capacity and good anchorage of the forecasts and inflation expectations, a reduction in the intervention interest rates is suitable.Some members from the majoritarian group pointed out that external risks persist that limit the possibilities of carrying out a more expansionary monetary policy.",
        "They highlighted the still relatively high level of the current account deficit, and possible unexpected effects of the normalization process of monetary policy in the United States.",
        "For this reason, they pointed out that a reduction in the benchmark interest rate should not be understood as the beginning of a path of cuts.Other members within the same group underlined that much of the recent information on economic activity continues to show a low dynamics, which has begun to affect labor market variables.",
        "These factors, added to the previous excesses of installed capacity, deserve a more countercyclical and less contractive monetary policy.Two Board Members voted to keep the benchmark interest rate unaltered.",
        "These members stressed that, should the risks still posed by inflation forecasts materialize, they could hinder the convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon.",

        "However, Colombia’s trading partners in the region continue to exhibit low performance of their economic activity.",
        "In the United States, the market has significantly increased the likelihood that the Fed would increase its benchmark rate once more in the rest of the year.",
        "Additional increases are expected for 2018.Regarding the price of oil, the news about greater compliance with the OPEC agreements in recent weeks, as well as a more dynamic demand, would have contributed to increase the prices in this market.",
        "The average price for the year to date (28 September) for Brent oil is USD $52.5/b, higher than the average forecast for 2017 (USD $51, Brent).In Colombia, the information available for the third quarter of 2017 suggests that the pace of expansion of the GDP would have been low, but higher than the records for the first half of the year.",
        "This performance would be partly explained by a low basis for comparison in the same period of 2016 (as a result of supply shocks in transport that took place in July last year, as well as by the effect of the Easter holiday).",
        "However, when controlling these effects, the dynamics of the GDP in the third quarter reflects acceleration.",
        "Additionally, the behavior of some indicators of economic activity has been somewhat better than expected.Regarding the labor market, the seasonally adjusted series of the unemployment rate to July show a relatively stable unemployment rate at the national level, and an increasing trend in the 13 urban areas.As for credit, since March total indebtedness shows a relatively stable nominal growth (close to 6.0%).",
        "In the last few months, household credit has slowed, but keeps increasing at rates that exceed inflation and growth of nominal GDP.",
        "Commercial debt grows at a low rate, somewhat lower than inflation.",
        "The interest rates on commercial loans (exception for construction) have registered falls that are higher than the one for the policy rate.",
        "Transmission towards households’ interest rates on loans has been lower.With all this, growth in the second half of this year is expected to be low, but higher than in the first half of 2017.",
        "This is due to a better performance of domestic demand, both in consumption and investment.",
        "The contribution of the foreign trade accounts to GDP growth would have been less negative.",
        "For all of 2017, the technical staff maintained its estimation for GDP growth close to 1.6%, within a range between 1.0% and 2.0%.As expected, after a year of continuous decline, inflation increased in August and stood at 3.9% on a yearly basis.",
        "The greatest inflationary pressures concentrated in perishable goods and, to a lesser extent, in regulated items and non-tradable goods.",
        "On the contrary, the tradable sector, together with processed foods and meals outside the home, contributed to lower inflation.Inflation expectations to December 2017 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts increased slightly, posting at 4.18%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to a year increased slightly, standing between 3.4% and 3.6%.In all, for the remainder of 2017, inflation is expected to increase slightly, taking into account that it is likely that food prices do not exert downward pressures and that non-food inflation will continue to reflect the effects of the indexing of prices and the increase in indirect taxes at the beginning of the year.",
        "This would take place in an environment of weak economic activity.",
        "Monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target  AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board highlighted that, as expected, the figure for annual inflation increased in August to 3.87% after a year of continuous decline.",
        "This performance was mainly explained by the higher pace of the yearly increase of food CPI due to a low basis for comparison.",
        "However, the average of core inflation indicators continued descending, standing at 4.74%.The figures available for economic activity suggest that economic growth in the third quarter would be low, but higher than in the first half of the year.",
        "Thus, Board Members expect higher growth for the rest of the year, in line with past forecasts.They also emphasized that, although external demand remains weak, it has been recovering mainly thanks to the performance of developed economies.",
        "Also, that higher oil prices could lead to an improvement in the country's terms of trade, which would bring their average to be higher than in 2016.Five Board Members voted to keep the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 5.25%, while two of them voted in favor of reducing it by 25 bp.The members of the majoritarian group considered that after a 250 bp reduction of the benchmark rate, and given that the real value of the reference rate is close to its neutral level, a pause would be timely until new information on the future performance of inflation and inflation forecasts, the output gap, and the current account deficit is available.",
        "For this group, the possibility of leading monetary policy to an expansionary stance will depend on the above-mentioned factors.The remaining two Board Members considered that the weakness of economic activity deserves an immediate counter-cyclical response, since the output gap is increasing, and the results in terms of inflation have been good and according to the forecasts.",
        "Inflation expectations to twelve months are within the target range.",
        "This group considers that inflation will continue converging to its target, as it has done up to now, and that it is important now to provide a greater stimulus to the recovery of economic growth.",
        "The current account deficit will continue reducing, given the levels of the exchange rate, external prices, and economic activity DECISIONThe Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicaat today’s meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 5.25%.The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged was approved by five (5) members of the Board.",

        "Therefore, this report revised the growth projection for 2016 downwards to 1.8% as the most likely figure, within a range between 1.6% and 2.0% (compared to 2.0%, within a range between 1.5% and 2.5% in the previous report).",
        "The current account deficit would have posted for the whole year at 4.5% of GDP (within a range between 4.3% and 4.7% of GDP).For 2017, GDP growth is projected between 0.7% and 2.7%, with 2.0% as the most likely figure.",
        "This forecast, which takes into account the effects of the Tax Reform, suggests an adjustment of expenditure consistent with the deterioration of the dynamics of national income due to the strong shocks registered since 2014.",
        "It also incorporates a recovery of the terms of trade for the country on account of the higher international prices of oil and of the main export products.",
        "External demand would exhibit a slight recovery resulting from growth of the main trading partners, somewhat better than in 2016.The current account deficit for 2017 would stand between 3.0% and 4.4% of GDP, with 3.7% in the baseline scenario.",
        "This forecast considers an increase in the cost of external financing, mainly explained by possible increases in the Fed’s benchmark interest rate.",
        "International markets could register a higher volatility, for example due to the measures that can be taken by the new government in the United States and decisions regarding Brexit, among others.In Colombia, at the end of 2016, inflation stood at 5.75%, 322 bp less than the maximum reached in July and 102 bp below the figure for December 2015.",
        "The behavior of the food groups and of tradables (excluding food and regulated items) explained the reduction in inflation during the month and at the end of the previous year.",
        "Core inflation indicators also lowered, and their average stood at 5.60%.",
        "The different measures of inflation expectations remain above the target (3.0%).",
        "Analysts' expectations for December of 2017 have continued to rise, from 4.1% in November to 4.5% in January.",
        "All those derived from public debt bonds also increased: for 2 years, to 4.8%; for 3 years, to 4.3%; and for 5 years, to 3.8%.For 2017, it is expected that the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade, in an environment of a weak economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, the increase in value-added tax and other indirect taxes would pressure inflation upwards.",
        "The monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target.In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit continues to adjust.",
        "The dynamics of output have been weaker than forecast, and inflation continues to decline, although the core inflation indicators and inflation expectations exceed the 3.0% target.",
        "The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is likely to continue.",
        "The tax reform adopted by the Congress favors productive investment and enables the achievement of higher levels of income in the long term, besides consolidating the country's fiscal and external sustainability AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board of Directors highlighted the following changes in the information available since their last meeting.",
        "In the first place, an increase in global uncertainty arising from expectations regarding changes in the United States’ fiscal and trade policies and their possible impact on the Fed's benchmark interest rates, and consequently on the global financial markets; secondly, an increase in all the measures of inflation expectations; finally, worse-than-expected output growth and domestic demand.",
        "The Board agrees that, if no negative, significant inflationary shocks arise, the benchmark interest rate will decrease in the coming quarters.",
        "The pace at which this takes place will only depend on the new data available.The majority of Board Members voted in favor of maintaining the benchmark interest rate unaltered.Among this group, some members of the Board emphasized that the new most outstanding fact —and at the same time, worrisome— since the last meeting of the Board on 16 December is the increase in inflation expectations, including those for December 2018.",
        "Also, according to the Fan Chart, the probability of achieving the target in December 2017 lowered to 40%, exhibiting a slower convergence.",
        "They stated that under the current circumstances, a rate cut is not advisable on two considerations: on the one hand, domestically, due to the possible impact that new inflationary shocks may produce on inflation expectations,  indexation mechanisms, and the greater persistence of the price increase of non-tradable goods; on the other, externally, because of the uncertainty associated with political and economic events in the US and Europe, mainly, which may affect capital flows, the exchange rate, and inflation.",
        "Future movements of the benchmark interest rate must be subject to the evolution of expectations and to the speed of the convergence of expectations and observed inflation towards the target.Other members highlighted that, despite the fact that the economy has been adjusting quickly, risks persist that indexation mechanisms generate inefficiencies in the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Consequently, they considered desirable a path of a gradual reduction of the benchmark interest rate in order to incorporate progressively the information that affects the forecasts for inflation and output gap in the policy horizon.A group of Board Members proposed a 25-bp reduction of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They stressed that the risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand has increased.",
        "Additionally, they pointed out that the monetary policy stance continues to be contractionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by majority, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.5%.This decision was approved by four members of the Board.",

        "The branches of activity with the highest growth rates during the year were financial services, construction, and agriculture, while mining and transport exhibited contractions.On demand side, the DANE will publish the figures on 1 March.",
        "The available information suggests that in the year, domestic demand would have stalled versus 2015 as a result of the slowdown in consumption (households and Government) and a fall in investment.",
        "Net exports would have contributed positively to growth.",
        "Foreign trade figures (in US dollars) show a decrease in the deficit of goods close to 25%.So far in 2017, the information on economic activity is still very scarce.",
        "The negative outcome of the consumer confidence index stands out, standing in January at the lowest part of the series (since November 2001).For 2017, GDP growth is still projected between 0.7% and 2.7%, with 2.0% as the most likely figure.Regarding inflation, in January it posted at 5.47% annually, 28 bp less than in December 2016; however, the average of the four core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank stopped declining.",
        "The available information suggests that during January part of the observed increase in consumer prices was due to the impact of the tax reform (by the change in the VAT, the green tax and the Liquor Act).Measures of inflation expectations by economic analysts to December 2017 and 2018 increased (10 bp and 6 bp, respectively), while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years remained relatively stable.As for the external context, the most recent indicators for the United States and Europe suggest that their economies maintain a dynamism similar to that of previous quarters.",
        "Regarding Latin America, low growth rates continued during the fourth quarter.So far in 2017, the improvement of the international prices of major commodities exported by the region would contribute to the strengthening of the currencies and the lowering of the country risk indicators.",
        "In the first weeks of the year, there have been significant capital inflows to emerging economies.For 2017, it is expected that the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade, in an environment of a weak economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, the increase in value-added tax and other indirect taxes would pressure inflation upwards.",
        "The monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target AND OPTIONSWith information from the last month, the Board of Directors highlighted the continued reduction in the headline inflation indicator, the weak performance of the economy so far this year, and the favorable reduction in the current account deficit.",
        "All this confirms the Board’s conviction that there are conditions to change the contractionary monetary policy stance gradually towards its neutral level, at a pace that will depend on the information and the risks observed in each session.",
        "The sharp drop in consumer confidence raised particular concern, although in recent months this index has lost its correlation with domestic demand and household consumption.A majoritarian group voted to reduce the rate by 25 bp.",
        "Among the arguments sustained by these Board Members, the following stand out: the low growth forecast by the technical staff for this year, the poor performance of the industry in recent months, the slight increase in the unemployment rate in the thirteen major cities, and the collapse of the consumer confidence index.",
        "Some members considered it is necessary to avoid the risk of falling into a negative spiral of a greater slowdown of the economy, and that greater attention should be given to recovering confidence, given the relatively favorable behavior expected for the external deficit.",
        "Finally, regarding inflation expectations and their slight increase in the last month, some Board Members within this group pointed out that, with a 25 bp reduction, the benchmark interest rate continues to be contractionary, and reaffirmed that the change should continue to be gradual in the future, depending on the observed data and, particularly, on the inertia and indexation of inflation.The minority group, while acknowledging the importance of a gradual normalization of monetary policy, voted in favor of maintaining the reference rate unchanged.",
        "Among the arguments posed by the members of this group, the following stand out: the degree of persistence of inflation is still high; inflation expectations increased again slightly and continue above the long-term target in the policy horizon.",
        "One member of the Board stated that, although there are still external and internal factors for uncertainty, there are reasons to believe that the economy has bottomed out and, although slowly, it can begin to recover.",

        "For the moment, S&P’s decision to reduce Colombia´s credit rating has had moderate effects on the country´s risk measurements, on the price of TES, and on the price of the peso against the dollar.The information on the current account deficit to September of 2017 shows that the external imbalance continues to adjust vis-à-vis the same period last year.",
        "This continues being a result of the better performance of external revenues, particularly the exports of goods favored by the better terms of trade, and to a lesser extent, by a better behavior of net exports.Given the information observed to the third quarter, the GDP growth of 1.6% expected by the technical staff for all of 2017, would imply an annual expansion of 1.8% in the last quarter.",
        "However, available activity and perception indicators for the fourth quarter continue to show a low dynamism in the economy and reveal that several of the downside risks in growth would be materializing.The credit slowdown continued in the last month, explained mainly by the moderation in household indebtedness, particularly in the consumer modality.The commercial credit also slowed down in November and registered an annual growth of 5.1%.In November, annual consumer inflation increased for the fourth consecutive month and stood at 4.12%, above that expected by the technical staff and by the market.",
        "This is mainly explained by the rebound in the annual adjustment of perishable foods, tradables and, to a lesser extent, non-tradables.",
        "Core inflation interrupted the downward trend that it had been presenting and stood at 4.54% in the last month.Inflation expectations for December of 2017, obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts, increased, and stood at 4.01%.",
        "The expectations calculated from the public debt bonds, with horizons of 2 and 3 years, had some increases vis-à-vis the previous month and stand above 3.0%.In summary, to December 2017, inflation is expected to finish slightly below 4.0% and decline in the first quarter next year, partly as a result of the reversal of the transitory shocks that have diverted it from its target.",
        "This takes place in an environment of economic activity that continues to be weak.",
        "Monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target AND OPTIONSThe Board of Directors decided unanimously to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.75%.",
        "In making this decision, they considered that inflation for November was above that forecast byBanco de la República´s technical staff, that the average of the core inflation indicators stopped falling, that the inflation forecasts continue showing a decrease for the first quarter of 2018, and that this trend is expected to strengthen.",
        "Although the inflation figure for November was not good, there is a high probability that inflation will be close to 4.0%, or even slightly below, by the end of 2017.They also referenced the weakness of demand, which is reflected both in the GDP data for the third quarter and in the industry, commerce and consumption surveys available for the third quarter.",
        "On the external front, the good performance of total exports is highlighted, driven mainly by oil and carbon, as well as by non-traditional exports.The Board Members also agreed that the space to decrease the benchmark interest rate has been reduced.",
        "For this reason, they considered it appropriate to wait for more information on the behavior of inflation, output and the exchange rate before reducing the policy rate.As for the credit rating reduction announced by S&P, the Board observed that the market has had no significant reaction that may alter in a relevant way the inflation and product forecasts DECISIONThe Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.75%.Bogotá,"

        "The annual increase in tradables, excluding food and regulated goods, declined from 1.4% in December to 1.2% in January.",
        "This reflects accumulated appreciation in the exchange rate during recent months and international price stability for industrial products.",
        "Given the preliminary data for February, inflation expectations derived from trading in government bonds at 1, 5 and 10 years came to 4.26%, 4.89% and 5.05%, respectively, with 57 bp, 64 bp and 65 bp variations compared to the averages for January.",

        "The result has been an increase in risk perception with respect to that country and others with huge debts, such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland, as reflected in larger spreads on their sovereign bonds.",
        "This situation has brought pressure to bear on the euro, weakening it against the dollar and undermining investor confidence and stock market performance in the developed economies.",
        "As for the emerging economies, the impact of the government debt problems in Europe has been low.",
        "Although the countries in the region saw their risk premiums go up slightly last month, this situation was reversed somewhat during the past week.",

        "Annual growth in the primary monetary aggregates stabilized during the past nine weeks at rates between 5.0% and 8.0%.",
        "In the case of M3, the stability in the growth rate was the result of a build-up in savings and a slowdown in term deposits.",
        "The nominal annual increase in the total gross loan portfolio came to 5.8% by early February, which is a little more than at the end of 2009 (4.9%).",

        "In real terms, all average interest rates were down in January.",
        "Government bond performance in January was mixed, with depreciation in -term bonds (24 bp), valuation in short-term bonds (-35 bp) and stability in long-term bonds (2 bp).",
        "The following points were emphasized by the Board of Directors during its deliberations: The January figure for inflation, which was less than the rate forecast by the Central Bank’s technical team, mainly because of good performance with respect to food prices The increase in core inflation indicators The temporary effect El Niño weather could have on higher prices The optimism reflected in producer and consumer confidence indicators The increase in monetary aggregates at rates between 5% and 8% The financial system’s peso loan portfolio, which continues to grow in excess of nominal GDP How market interest rates performed in response to the decline in the Central Bank’s benchmark rate The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and on growth in output in the tradable sectors Interest rates on government bonds, which showed mixed performance for the different tranches.",
        "The main points analyzed by the Board members centered on: the elements that affect inflation forecasts for 2010, particularly an eventual temporary surge in food and regulated prices due to El Niño weather; the lag between monetary policy measures and their impact on production and prices; forecasts for economic growth in 2010; the sharp drop anticipated in exports to Venezuela; the performance of monetary aggregates and how it might affect economic recovery; the recent momentum in the financial system’s commercial and mortgage loan portfolio; (vii) the increase in expectations of inflation the risk balance between growth and inflation in the context of an economy that continues to demonstrate weak growth and a level of inflation that is within the long-term range set by the Board of Directors; and the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor expectations for inflation close to the long-term target.",
        "The Board of Directors emphasized the following with respect to the performance of inflation during the month: annual consumer inflation in January was 2.1%, having been 2% at the end of December; core inflation indicators were up slightly, while expectations for inflation one-year out increased, but remain within the target range set by the Board of Directors, which coincides with the long-term range (between 2% y 4%); annual inflation in January was due fundamentally to higher prices for regulated goods; in spite of El Niño weather, the decline in food prices continued; although perishables experienced price hikes, they were more than offset by non-perishables and food outside the home; (vi) the Central Bank’s inflation forecasts include temporary increases in the price of food as a result of El Niño weather, but they are expected to be reversed during the second half of the year.",

        "Expectations within the business community have improved, and there is more growth in private consumption.",
        "The Board of Directors believes the Central Bank’s expansive monetary policy has permitted a steady decline in interest rates on deposits and lending.",
        "It also is of the opinion that the benchmark rate, as it now stands, continues to kindle economic growth in an environment that is characterized by a healthy financial system.",
        "Therefore, it decided to hold the Central Bank’s intervention rate at the current levels.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed to make no change in the Central Bank’s intervention rate, leaving it at 3.5%.",

        "The PPI increased mainly because of a drop in the basis of comparison in May of last year Growth The data released in recent weeks indicate the Colombian economy will grow faster than expected.",
        "The following are some of the relevant indicators: The industrial confidence indicator in April, which includes questions about orders, inventory and expectations and is correlated closely with annual growth in industrial production, continued to exhibit an upward tendency.",
        "The way this indicator has performed recently is explained by the questions on industrial inventory and orders.",
        "The opposite was true several months back, when the question on the momentum in expectations for production was the only one to show an increase.",
        "The total demand for energy rose 4.4% during May, in annual terms, posting increases compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and the early months of 2010.",
        "The Fedsarrollo Consumer Confidence Indicator was up again in May.",

        "Total exports in April came to US$3.491 billion, having grown 43.8% with respect to the same month in 2009.",
        "This was due to more exports in dollars from the mining sector (73.6%) as well as the industrial sector (30.8%).",

        "Sales to Ecuador were a high point, having grown 49.3% in April compared to the same month the year before.",
        "Although countries such as the United States, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador have gained ground as destinations for Colombia’s industrial exports, minus the leading products, the average monthly extent of these sales during 2010 to date (US$840 m) is still less than the average on record for the same period in 2007 (US$903 m).",
        "Total imports (CIF) in April came to US$3.182 billion, having increased 19.3% in value compared to the same month in 2009; however, they were 4.2% less with respect to March 2010.",

        "Purchases of capital goods were down 13.8% in April compared to the same month the year before, thanks to fewer imports of transportation equipment (-47,7%) and despite an annual increase of 16.9% in imports of capital goods for industry External Context The markets continued to exhibit a great deal of volatility during May and early June.",
        "Added to the debt problems of the so-called (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) were those of Hungary.",
        "This situation led to an increase in global risk indicators; however, their impact on the emerging countries in the region, including Colombia, has not been severe.",
        "As a result, international stock markets continued to fall sharply, particularly in the developed countries, where an important part of the valuation gained during the past year was lost.",
        "At the same time, the euro continued to depreciate against the dollar.",

        "The Colombian stock market is one of the most stable.",

        "During that period, several countries in the region, such as Brazil and Peru, saw an important increase in GDP, as other emerging countries in Asia.",
        "The main impact of the added external uncertainty has been on commodity prices, particularly in the case of oil.",
        "If this tendency continues it will be especially damaging for commodity exporting countries, as it will affect their terms of trade and, in doing so, their GDP Financial Variables There were no changes during May in the tendencies of the major monetary aggregates.",
        "M3 rose at an annual rate of 8.0%.",

        "The main points analyzed by the members of the Board centered on the following aspects: (i) the forecasts for inflation in 2010 and 2011 ; (ii) less variation in the price of tradable goods due to appreciation of the peso with respect to the dollar; (iii) the time it takes monetary policy measures to have an effect on production and prices; (iv) forecasts for economic growth in 2010, which suggest the recovery will be faster than anticipated; (v) the recent increase in the financial system’s loan portfolio and in asset prices; (vi) the drop in inflation expectations; (vii) the risk balance between growth and inflation in the context of a recovering economy and inflation that is slightly below the long-term target range; (viii) the uncertainty the European crisis has sparked in the world economy; and (ix) the need to bolster the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations to the long-term target.",
        "The Board of Directors highlighted the following with respect to the way inflation behaved during the month: (i) annual consumer inflation in May was 2.07%, which is slightly higher than in April (9 bp), but less than expected by the market and by the Central Bank’s technical team; (ii) most of the core inflation indicators are still in the lower part of the long-term target range set by the Board (3% +/-1%); (iii) inflation expectations continued to decline; and (iv) the outcome for inflation last month is consistent with the technical team’s forecasts, which show- with a high degree of certainty – that inflation will be within the long-term target range in 2010 and 2011.",
        "The Board emphasized that information received in the last few weeks indicates the Colombian economy will grow faster than expected, without producing inflationary pressures.",
        "The increase in exports, fueled by the recovery in global economic momentum and better terms of trade confirms the build-up in the Colombian economy, as do other factors such as the increase in consumer and producer confidence, the increase in a number of leading indicators, and the soundness of the financial system.",
        "The international markets have been extremely volatile as a result of the government debt crisis in several European countries.",

        "The increase was primarily in urban salaried jobs.",
        "Two aspects stand out with respect to the latest information on investments.",
        "The first is the slow but steady recovery in imports of capital goods, particularly for industry.",

        "As for annual variations, the decline in GDP during the third quarter of 2009 was related to fewer investments.",
        "DANE reported a decline in gross capital formation, due to a sharp reduction in investments other than those in works.",
        "The other component of internal demand, consumption (government and private consumption combined), contributed positively to the annual variation in GDP during that period.",

        "This is US$737 million (m) less than the deficit posted during the same period in 2008.",
        "That reduction originated with the decline in current outlays (-US$7.019 b), which exceeded the drop in current income (-US$6.282 b).",
        "The aforementioned deficit was financed with US$4.894 b in capital inflows (3 % of GDP), mainly US$6.165 b in resources from the public sector (including Ecopetrol).",
        "The capital and financial account surplus is US$ 2.166 b less than it was during the same period in 2008.",

        "Total exports in dollars saw 25.9% annual growth in November 2009, largely because exports to the United States were up 61.6%.",

        "Monthly inflation was 0.11% and the indicators for core inflation declined again.",
        "The annual change in food prices went from 1% in May to 1.5% in June basically due to the prices for perishables.",

        "It is important to emphasize that with the new 2005 base, gross formation of fixed capital expanded throughout 2009.",
        "Net exports (exports minus imports), in turn, contributed negatively to growth.",
        "While imports rose at a positive annual rate for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008, exports continued shrinking in annual terms although at a slower pace than the rate seen last year.",
        "For imports, the recovery was mainly driven by the purchase of consumer goods.",
        "By branches of economic activity, the sectors that were responsible for the annual growth of the GDP were, in the following order, construction (public work projects), mining, utilities, industry and trade all of which had an annual growth higher than 3%.",
        "In the case of utilities, the good performance of those offered by the government stood out.",
        "The only sector that showed an annual decline in its economic activity was agriculture, which was due to a contraction of the GDP in the fishing sector and to the fact that coffee production remained at low levels with respect to the year before.",
        "For the second quarter of 2010 the majority of the available indicators suggest that the annual expansion of economic activity continued at a more dynamic pace than what was seen in the first quarter of the year.",
        "Some relevant indicators show the following: – The Fedesarrollo Consumer Opinion Survey that measures the household confidence index rose in April, May and June and approached its highest historical levels this last month.",
        "The Consumer Confidence Index has been driven mainly by the better expectations that households have regarding the future performance of the economy and to a lesser degree, a better perception of the current economic conditions.",
        "The improvement in consumer confidence goes hand in hand with more financial resources to purchase durable goods, housing and cars.",
        "– The retail sales reported by DANE grew in real terms at an annual rate of 8% and 13.1% for the months of April and May respectively.",
        "The expansion of retail sales in May, excluding automobiles, was 7.9%.",
        "– In May, the annual change for the industrial production index (IPI) excluding coffee threshing was 7.5% which is lower than for the month of April (7.9%).",
        "In spite of the fact that in May, the seasonally adjusted level of the IPI fell slightly, the series is maintaining a solid rising trend.",
        "Based on the available information, the technical team a forecast of the annual GDP growth for the second quarter of the year.",
        "The result of this exercise was a predicted interval of 4.3% to 5.5% with 4.9% as the most probable figure.",
        "For all of 2010, the technical team estimates that the GDP will grow within a range of between 3.5% and 5.5% with 4.5% being the most probable.",
        "The total exports in dollars for the month of May came to US$3,510 million thus registering an increase of 28% with respect to the same month last year.",
        "This trend is explained by the increase in the mining sector (42%) and industrial sector (21%) exports.",
        "In volume, sales abroad from those sectors also showed increases (31% and 13% respectively).",
        "However, in May industrial sector exports excluding coffee, petroleum derivatives, nickel-iron and gold registered levels similar to those seen in the same month in 2009 with an annual growth of 1%.",
        "The main export products (coffee, coal, nickel-iron, petroleum and its derivatives), which represented 61% of the total sales abroad in the month of May, registered an annual growth of 51% in value and 31% in volume during that period.",
        "In May, industrial sector sales to Venezuela excluding the main products (coffee, petroleum derivatives, nickel-iron and gold) shrank 68% in annual terms while those to Ecuador, the United States and the rest of the countries had annual rises of 42%, 27% and 57% respectively.",
        "In spite of the fact that countries like the United States, Brazil, Chile, China and Ecuador have been the destinations for a larger share of our industrial exports excluding the main products, the average monthly levels so far in 2010 for the total sales of these products (US$867 m) remain below the levels registered during the same period in 2007 (US$947 m).",
        "The total imports (CIF) for the month of May came to US$3,184 million, a value that was 30.1% higher than that registered for the same month the year before.",
        "This increase came mainly from the larger purchases of consumer goods (durable goods in particular) and intermediate goods (specifically fuel and goods for industry).",
        "Imports of capital goods, in turn, registered an increase of 14.4% in May with respect to the same month the year before due to the larger purchases of goods for industry (36.6%).",
        "In the March-May period, the unemployment rate for the national total was 12%.",
        "In the 13 main cities, it declined, going from 12.9% for the same period in 2009 to 12.5% in 2010.",
        "Upon analyzing the seasonally adjusted series, it can be seen that over the course of the quarter, the unemployment rate declined in comparison with the levels seen at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010.",
        "This was possible due to lower pressure from the overall rate of participation which had stopped expanding at the pace it had been growing at the end of 2009 External Context During the second quarter, the global economy continued growing due to the better trend in emerging economies and the United States.",
        "The developing countries, the Asian countries in particular, are still leading the revival of world demand although a significant recovery has been seen in Latin America as well.",
        "In spite of this favorable panorama, the public debt crisis in Europe has generated fear regarding the sustainability of the world recovery and, in particular, of the developed countries.",
        "Furthermore, the developed economies continue to face problems that could limit their growth over the next few quarters.",
        "The most serious ones are the weakness that the labor market is showing, the high level of household debt and the restrictions on bank loans that remain in effect.",
        "With respect to the emerging economies, an event from last month that stands out was the slight slowdown of China’s GDP which grew 10.3% in the second quarter of 2010 after the 11.9% seen in the previous quarter.",
        "This phenomenon is due to a change in the economic policy posture adopted by that country a few months ago to cool down the economy.",
        "In spite of this, growth for China and the rest of Asia is expected to remain strong for the rest of the year.",
        "In Latin America, dynamic growth was seen in the first quarter.",
        "The most outstanding cases were Brazil and Peru, which had annual rates of 9% and 6% respectively.",
        "However, although the prices for commodities had had sharp falls due to the financial upheaval, they showed a tendency to recover by remaining at historically high levels.",
        "For what is left of the year and for 2011, substantial changes in their levels are not expected, as a result of which, the terms of trade for countries that are exporters of raw materials like Colombia will continue to be favored.",
        "With respect to consumer inflation, both total and core inflation remain at low levels in the majority of the industrialized countries.",
        "Therefore, and due to the weakness of growth and employment, the central banks for these economies are expected to keep their interest rates at levels close to zero in 2010 with a few notable exceptions like Canada and Australia.",
        "In Latin America, with the exception of Argentina and Venezuela, inflation seems to be under control at relatively low levels.",
        "In spite of this, the sharp economic growth has led to adjustments to the monetary policy of various countries in the region.",
        "Regarding the currencies, the dollar has strengthened so far this year against the euro and the pound sterling although in the case of emerging economy currencies the trend has been mixed.",
        "The Colombia peso, in particular, has appreciated around 8% so far this year.",
        "Finally, the risk premiums have remained stable or decreased slightly for emerging economies, especially for Latin American countries Financial Variables In the last few months, the annual growth of cash has surged.",
        "Based on the most recent data from the beginning of July, its growth is at 11.5% or 6 percentage points more than what was registered at the beginning of the year.",
        "M3 and liabilities subject to reserve requirements, in turn, that had shown relatively stable nominal rates of growth rose in volatility as a result of the trend of mainly fiduciary deposits.",
        "In real terms, the average rate of growth for M3 was 4.4% in June.",
        "With respect to loans, the annual growth of the portfolio in nominal local currency recovered in comparison to May.",
        "The declining trend for the commercial loan portfolio halted and the mortgage and consumer portfolios strengthened their surge.",
        "As of July 2, the annual rates of growth were 0.9%, 22.2% and 8.9% respectively.",
        "The total portfolio in local currency grew 5.6%.",
        "During the second half of the year, it is possible that there will be better loan performance based on the surveys of the financial sector done by the Banco de la República which capture aspects of supply.",
        "Based on those results, the loan entities seem to be more willing to grant loans compared to what was observed at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010.",
        "With regards to demand, the Fedesarrollo survey indicates that consumers are more willing to purchase real estate and durable goods that require financing.",
        "With respect to the interest rate, the interbanking ones have remained adjusted to the policy rate since -April.",
        "The reductions in the Banco de la República’s benchmark interest rate continued their transmission to the market rates in June.",
        "In the case of the DTF, the level was 3.5% this last month compared to 3.6% in May.",
        "With regards to the lending rates, all of them showed declines in June that swung between 9 bp (for consumption) and 38 bp (for mortgage).",
        "There was also a reduction in real terms, especially in those for mortgages.",
        "With respect to the price for assets, stocks resumed to their tendency to appreciate.",
        "Public debt securities with maturities of more than one year also rose in price.",
        "The price index for used housing is at historically high levels.",
        "Between June 18 and July 21 the rates for public debt securities showed negative variations of 10 bp, 51 bp and 65 bp in the short, medium and long tranches respectively AND Over the course of the discussion the following points stood out: (i) the result of inflation up to June was lower than that expected by the Banco de la República’s technical team; (ii) the indicators for core inflation resumed a declining trend and are within the target range fixed by the Board; (iii) inflation expectations continue to drop; (iv) the information from DANE about the growth of the GDP in the first quarter confirmed a faster recovery of the economy than what was expected; (v) the improvements in the businessmen’s and consumer’s expectations; (vi) stable growth in the monetary aggregates; (vii) the growth of the financial system portfolio in legal currency at levels similar to the estimated rise in the nominal GDP for 2010; (viii) the recent trend in the prices for assets; (ix) the trend in the market interest rates in response to the reduction of the Bank’s benchmark rate; (x) the effect of the exchange rate on inflation and the growth of the product of the tradable sectors; (xi) the interest rates for public debt securities which fell during the month and (xii) the recovery of the world economy and the severe uncertainty generated by the crisis in some European countries.",
        "The Board members’ main points of analysis centered around the following aspects: (i) the inflation projections for 2010 and 2011; (ii) the reduced variation in prices for tradable goods due to the appreciation of the peso compared to the dollar; (iii) the lagged effect of monetary policy measures on production and prices; (iv) the projections for economic growth for 2010 which suggest a more rapid recovery than predicted and which led the technical team to raise their forecast for the year; (v) the recent movement in the financial system portfolio and in the high level of prices for assets; (vi) the drop in inflation expectations; (vii) the recent trend in capital flows; (viii) the balance of risk between growth and inflation in a context of a recovering economy and inflation that is at the long term target range and (ix) the need to maintain the monetary authority’s credibility and anchor inflation expectations to the long term target.",
        "The Board of Directors emphasized the following regarding the inflation trend for the month: (i) annual consumer inflation in June was 2.25%, which was higher than in April (18 bp) but below what was expected by the Banco de la República’s technical team; (ii) the majority of the core inflation indicators started falling again and remain in the lower part of the target range for long term inflation set by the Board (3% plus or minus 1%); (iii) inflation expectations also continued to fall; (iv) the result of inflation last month is in line with the projections made by the technical team which shows, with a high degree of confidence, that inflation will be within the long term target range in 2010 and 2011.",
        "The Board emphasized that the information received in the last few weeks indicates that the economy is growing at a faster pace than expected without generating inflationary pressures.",
        "The growth in exports, which is driven by the recovery of momentum in the global economy and better terms of trade; the rise in consumer and producer confidence; the momentum of various leading indicators and solidity of the financial system confirm the strength of the Colombian economy.",
        "Given the above, the technical team of the Banco de la Republica raised their forecast for the growth of the GDP for 2010 indicating that this will be within a range of 3.5% to 5.5% with 4.5% being the most probable.",
        "In the second quarter, the global economy continued to grow due to the better trend in the emerging economies and the USA with the steady recovery of the economies in Latin America standing out.",
        "The international markets, in turn, stabilized after the financial crisis in Europe.",
        "All of the above led to a reduction in the risk premiums and the appreciation of various currencies in the region including the Colombian peso.",
        "The Board believes that the expansionary monetary policy that has been adopted has contributed to the short term economic growth.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed to keep the benchmark rate of the Banco de la República unchanged and it will remain at 3%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on September 24, 2010.",
        "Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Cesar Vallejo Mr. Juan Pablo Zárate Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed during the meeting Annual consumer inflation was 2.31% in August (0.11% for the month) compared to 2.24% in July.",
        "As a result, accumulated inflation is now 2.54%.",
        "As has been the case for several months, the main upward pressure on annual inflation comes from prices for regulated items and food.",
        "The annual increase in prices for regulated items went from 5.23% in July to 5.69% in August, due to adjustments in utility rates, specifically for water and residential natural gas.",
        "The annual variation in the food CPI was 1.80% in August, as opposed to 1.71% the month before.",
        "The annual variation in prices for non-tradables, excluding food and regulated items, decline from 3.78% in July to 3.69% in August.",
        "The annual increase in prices for tradable goods, excluding food and regulated items, remained constant at -0.77% between July and August.",
        "The core inflation indicators remained virtually stable during the past month and were below 3%.",
        "The lowest continued to be the CPI excluding food and regulated prices, with an annual increase of 1.7%.",
        "Given the preliminary figures for September to date, inflation expectations derived from trading in government bonds at one, five and 10 years came to 2.43%, 3.67% and 3.98%, with respective variations of +74 bp, -2 bp and -9 bp compared to the average the month before.",
        "Inflation expectations detected in the monthly survey conducted by Banco de la República at the start of September continue to show reductions and are within the long-term target range set by the Board of Directors.",
        "As to pressure from non-wage costs, it is important to note that PPI performance to date suggests these costs are not significant.",
        "The annual variation in the PPI by August was only 2.0%, with a slight increase due to an extremely low base of comparison Growth DANE says GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.5% during the second quarter.",
        "With the new figures, household consumption continued to recover, bolstered by low interest rates, high levels of confidence and low inflation.",
        "Its annual growth went from 3.5% in the first quarter to 3.9% in the second.",
        "The decline in the unemployment rate came to a halt in July due to an increase in the supply of labor (12.6% total unemployment nationwide and 13.3% in the thirteen major cities).",
        "The employment rate for household heads remains at levels above 74%.",
        "In general, the economy is still being bolstered by internal demand, including total investment and government consumption.",
        "The negative contribution from net external demand was more pronounced in the second quarter than in the first, given the momentum gained by imports and the slow growth in exports.",
        "Growth during the first quarter of 2010 was revised downward to 4.2% as opposed to the initial estimate of 4.4%.",
        "This figure brought the average annual increase in GDP during the first half of the year to 4.3%.",
        "As for the third quarter, the supply indicators at hand show mixed performance and suggest that economic growth could slow in a number of branches such as transportation, energy, gas and water, and industry.",
        "In the case of the latter, this is according to the ANDI and Fedesarrollo surveys and the DANE data at July.",
        "The figures on demand are more favorable, particularly with respect to household consumption.",
        "According to the opinion polls in August and the latest figures on commerce, household consumption is growing at a good pace.",
        "A number of indicators, such as foreign investment, imports of capital goods for industry and the local manufacture of machinery and equipment, suggest that corporate investment is gaining strength.",
        "The increase in building permits and good performance with respect to mortgage lending also imply some recovery in building construction The External Context The latest available data on the external front suggests less growth in the United States and Japan.",
        "In the United States, which is Colombia’s major trading partner, GDP during the second quarter of 2010 was revised downward from 2.4% (a/q) to 1.6% (a/q), primarily because of slower growth in investments and exports.",
        "For the third quarter, the new figures on the job market, industrial sentiment, retail sales, consumer lending and housing starts suggest that growth during the second half of 2010 could be less than what analysts had estimated previously.",
        "The latest information on GDP in Europe was better than expected, causing the market to raise its forecasts for 2010 as a whole.",
        "However, the new data for the third quarter show this momentum is losing force.",
        "In July, industrial production in the Euro Zone rose 7.1% (the forecast was for 8%); a month earlier, it increased by 8.3%.",
        "In Germany, the country in the Euro Zone that has grown the most, the indicator of economic sentiment among analysts (ZEW) entered negative terrain in September, (-4.3 points; 14 points were expected) and reached its lowest level in 19 months.",
        "With the exception of Venezuela, our major trading partners in Latin America experienced high growth rates during the second quarter of 2010, although those rates are expected to be more moderate during the remainder of the year.",
        "In the case of Venezuela, GDP growth during the second quarter of 2010 (-1.9% annual) showed that country’s economy is still in a recession; however, it is less pronounced than analysts had predicted.",
        "Internal demand in Venezuela declined at an annual rate of 0.9% during the same period, primarily because of the drop in household consumption (-2.5% annual) Financial Variables In August, the nominal rates on consumer and ordinary lending averaged 17.6% and 9.8% respectively, having dropped by 32 bp and 6 bp, in that order, compared to the month before.",
        "The rates on mortgage lending remained stable at 12.9%.",
        "Accordingly, the interest rates on loans to households and companies are at historically low levels.",
        "The average annual increase in the total gross loan portfolio came to 6.6% in August, having been 4.4% the month before.",
        "The mortgage and consumer loan portfolios continued to be the most dynamic, with 19.3% and 10.6% annual growth, in that order.",
        "These figures exceed those in July by 50 bp and 130 bp, respectively.",

        "The impact of the exchange rate on inflation and prices in the tradable sectors The performance of government bonds Data on world economic growth, especially the figures on economic growth in the United States The main points analyzed by the Board members centered on the following aspects: (i) the inflation forecasts for 2010 and 2011; (ii) the decline in the variation in prices for tradables due to peso appreciation with respect to the dollar; (iii) the delayed effect of monetary policy measures on production and prices; (iv) the forecasts for economic growth in 2010, which suggest recovery will be slower than expected (v) investment performance and the increase in consumer confidence (vi) the recent momentum in the portfolio of the financial system; (vii) the rise in prices for financial assets and housing; (viii) the drop in inflation expectations; (ix) the recent developments in capital flows; (x) the performance of government bonds, which shows valuation at the short end of the curve and depreciation at the long end; (xi) the risk balance between growth and inflation in a context where the economy is recovering and inflation is within the long-term target range; and (xii) the need to maintain the monetary authority’s credibility and to anchor inflation expectations to the long-term target.",
        "The Board of Directors highlighted the following aspects with respect to inflation during the month: (i) Annual consumer inflation in August was 2.31%, which is slightly more than was anticipated by the market and by Banco de la República’s technical team.",
        "(ii) The core inflation indicators declined once again.",
        "(iii) Inflation expectations remain low.",
        "(iv) The outcome for inflation in August is consistent with the technical team’s forecasts.",
        "These suggest - with a high degree of confidence - that inflation will be within the long-term target range in 2010 and 2011.",
        "The Board emphasized that the information at hand indicates the Colombian economy is growing at the anticipated rate, without bringing inflationary pressure to bear.",
        "The economy still is being bolstered by internal demand, including total investment and government consumption.",
        "The world economy continued to grow, although more slowly than during the first half of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, the Asian economies are growing at a good pace and the Latin American economies have shown an increasing amount of recovery.",
        "As for the rest of the year and early 2011, the Board expects the Colombian economy to see favorable terms of trade, larger capital flows, low international interest rates and a weak recovery in external demand.",
        "The Board believes its expansive monetary policy has contributed to economic growth, without jeopardizing the inflation targets The Board of Directors agreed to hold Banco de la República’s intervention rate steady at 3%.",
        "On April 30, 2010 the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogota.",

        "So far this year, there have been upswings in the prices of perishables as a result of the Niño phenomenon though not as intensely as was expected.",
        "However, other components of the basket have declined due to the following factors: (i) a fall in the price of meat due to the weakness of domestic demand and the closing of exports to the Venezuelan market, (ii) moderate adjustments in the prices of eating out also because of the weakness in domestic demand and the moderate adjustment in the minimum salary, and (iii) stability in the prices of imported food as the result of the revaluation of the peso compared to the dollar.",
        "The annual increase in the prices of regulated goods went from 4.2% in February to 3.4% in March due to the lower annual growth in the CPI of utilities and public transportation.",

        "The annual rise in the prices for tradable goods excluding food and regulated goods fell from 1% in February to 0.3% in March.",
        "This level is the lowest one seen since a record for this indicator has been kept.",
        "The fall is determined by the accumulated appreciation of the peso compared to the dollar over the last few months, a domestic demand that is still weak, a foreign demand that is lower than was projected by the technical team, etc.",
        "With preliminary data for April, the inflation expectations derived from public debt negotiations for 1, 5 and 10 years declined and stood at 2.61%, 3.91% and 4.18% with drops of 105 bp, 78 bp and 29 bp respectively.",

        "Specifically, those related to the demand pointed to private consumption continuing to have the favorable momentum that has been seen for the last two quarters.",
        "The indicators associated with the formation of gross fixed capital other than public works and construction still show negative annual growth.",
        "Some of the relevant indicators are as follows: – The Fedesarrollo Consumer Confidence Indicator (CCI) with data as of March show that agent confidence grew for the third consecutive month and was at its highest level since 2008.",
        "The increase is explained by an improvement in household expectations for the economic situation in the short and medium term.",
        "– Up to February, retail sales maintained the growing trend that has been seen since the middle of last year.",
        "The high correlation between the growth in commercial sales and domestic consumption by households makes it possible to be confident of an upswing in this type of expenditure for the first quarter of 2010.",
        "– The retail sales of vehicles for household consumption as of March grew at an annual rate of 28.3%.",
        "– The annual change in the production index excluding coffee threshing was 3%, which is higher than what was expected by the Bank’s technical team (2.5%).",

        "– The imports of capital goods are falling in dollars and in real pesos (-21% annually as of February) which suggests that this expenditure will continue to show a contraction in annual terms during the first quarter.",
        "In February, 2010, total exports in dollars registered a growth of 22.9% with respect to the same month last year.",
        "This is due to the rise in exports from the mining (94.6%) and agricultural (7.6%) sectors.",

        "The Board members’ main points of analysis centered around the following aspects: (i) the inflation projections for 2010 and 2011; (ii) a reduction in the risks of rising inflation because of the lower impact of the Niño phenomenon on the prices of food; (iii) the reduction in the variation of prices of tradable goods due to the appreciation of the peso in comparison to the dollar; (iv) the lagged effect of the monetary policy measures on production and prices; (v) the growth projections for the economy in 2010 that suggest a faster recovery than anticipated; (vi) the recent momentum in the financial system portfolio; (vii) the fall in inflation expectations; (viii) the balance of risk between growth and inflation in the context of an economy that is recovering and an inflation that is slightly below the long term target range; (ix) the possible impact of the Greek crisis; and (x) the need to uphold the credibility of the monetary authority and anchor inflation expectations around the long term target.",

        "The information received in the last few weeks indicates that the economy is recovering more rapidly than expected without generating inflation pressures.",
        "Factors such as the greater growth of the world economy, the improvements in agents’ confidence and the momentum of various leading indicators show the strength of the growth.",
        "The technical work indicates that in spite of the greater growth of the economy, there is still a negative gap that, together with the positive trend of inflation and expectations, allows a more expansionary monetary policy without compromising the inflation targets and macroeconomic stability.",
        "The Board analyzed the following alternatives related to the posture of monetary policy: i) Reduce the Bank’s benchmark rate based on the fact that the technical analysis shows that a more expansionary monetary policy will contribute to economic recovery without putting the achievement of the inflation target for 2010 and 2011 at risk.",
        "ii) Table the above decision until next month in order to wait for the market to incorporate the new inflation projections into its expectations and thus, facilitate the transmission of monetary policy.",
        "iii) Keep the benchmark rate as it is while waiting for information that confirms the new projections and announcing that the Board will not be making increases in the benchmark interest rate in the near future.",

        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting Annual consumer inflation in September was at 2.28% (monthly was -0.14%) which was 3 basis points (bp) lower than in August.",
        "The lower percentage registered with respect to August was due to the downward pressure from perishables, non-tradable excluding food and regulated prices and from regulated prices.",
        "The annual change in the prices for food went from 1.8% in August to 1.72% in September.",
        "This was driven by perishable food which registered an annual inflation of 4.43% in September compared to 6.24% in August.",
        "The annual change in the prices for non-tradable goods and services excluding food and regulated prices also dropped from 3.69% in August to 3.58% in September.",

        "The lowest record, which is 1.67% annually, is still seen in the CPI excluding food and regulated prices.",
        "Using the data for October, the inflation expectations derived from the negotiations for the 1-, 5- and 10-year public debt were at 0.8%, 3.5%, and 3.8% with variations of -174 bp, -14 bp, and -27 bp respectively.",
        "This data is below the average from the previous month.",
        "The inflation expectations from the quarterly and monthly surveys done by the Banco de la Republica at the beginning of October continue to show declines and are within the long term target range fixed by the Board of Directors.",
        "The pressure from non-salary costs remain at low levels.",
        "Significant pressures are not seen on that front in spite of the increase registered in the last month.",
        "The annual change in the producer prices (PPI) was 2.3% compared to the 2.0% registered in August Growth The information from the third quarter suggests that, in general terms, the domestic demand continued to follow the trend seen in the first half of the year, which was characterized by the strength of household consumption and the sustained recovery of investment.",
        "For the third quarter, the supply indicators available have had mixed performances and suggest that the economic growth in various branches such as industry, electricity, gas and water, and transportation could become more moderate.",
        "According to the latest information from DANE, the industry would have shown an annual expansion rate of 4.4% in August.",
        "However, other sectors are showing a more outstanding performance as in the case of commerce, which according to DANE, expanded at an annual rate of 12.7% in August.",
        "This last figure agrees with the positive performance shown in the consumer confidence indicators for the third quarter.",
        "With respect to the labor market, the unemployment rate was at 10.6% in September for the national total and 11.5% for the 13 cities.",
        "These figures are lower than those seen last year.",
        "Investment is expected to rise in the third quarter.",
        "This prediction is based on the upswing in imports of capital goods, the positive performance of direct foreign investment and the local production of machinery and equipment.",
        "Likewise, the rise in construction permits and the strength of mortgage loans also support better performance in construction.",
        "With respect to foreign trade, using data as of August, total exports in dollars showed an annual variation of 22.3% that is mainly driven by the mining sector with an annual change of 30.4%.",
        "These figures are higher than those registered for the months of July and June.",
        "The total imports in dollars, in turn, showed an upsurge in August with an annual, 12-month accumulated 5.0% rate of growth compared to the -0.5% that had been registered a month before.",
        "The surge was seen in the three groups: consumption, raw materials and capital goods Foreign context The latest information available regarding the panorama abroad suggests a worldwide economic recovery that could occur more slowly and unequally than what the market has expected.",
        "Our main trading partner, the United States in particular, is showing more marked signs of slowdown than was expected by the market.",
        "In the second quarter of 2010, it grew 1.6% (a/q) after having grown at a rate of 3.7% (a/q) at the beginning of the year.",
        "This is confirmed by the third quarter indicators such as: the new data on the labor market, industry sentiment, retail sales, consumer credit, and housing starts.",
        "Together, the slowdown in this economy, the strong monetary injection and expectations of larger stimuli to the economy on the part of the Federal Reserve have continued weakening the dollar with respect to the majority of the currencies.",
        "The most recent information from Europe, in turn, continues to show a slow recovery in spite of the surge seen in Germany and France in the first and second quarters.",
        "The Asian countries, however, are maintaining positive rates of growth and are expected to continue down that road.",
        "In this region’s emerging economies, with the exception of Venezuela, the monetary policies and fiscal measures, levels of debt, capital flows, terms of trade and confidence continue to favor growth, especially that of domestic demand.",
        "This, together with the future outlook, has led the central banks in some of the countries (Peru, Brazil and Chile) to begin normalizing their monetary policies by raising their interest rates.",
        "In the case of Venezuela, several analysts are projecting a fall in the GDP of close to 2% for this year.",
        "This is in line with what was registered in the second quarter (-1.9%) and a recovery for 2011 that is barely starting.",

        "The strongest portfolios are still mortgages which have an annual variation of 22.5% and the consumer portfolio which has an annual variation 12.3%.",

        "The Board emphasized that the information that has been received indicates that the Colombian economy is growing at the pace predicted a couple of months ago without causing inflationary pressure.",
        "The economy is still being boosted by consumer confidence, the high terms of trade, the strengthening of business investment and the recovery of the financial system portfolio.",

        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicatook place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, July 26, 2019.",
        "In attendance were Alberto Carrasquilla Barrera, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; Juan José Echavarría, Governor of the Central Bank; and Board Members Gerardo Hernández Correa, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, José Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, Carolina Soto Losada, and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.The main monetary policy discussions considered by the Board are summarized as follows:1.",
        "AND OPTIONSThe Board members emphasized that inflation remains consistent with its convergence to the target in 2020.",
        "Although the forecasts suggest that it may divert from the target over the next few months, this is due to transitory supply shocks.",
        "According to this, the average of core inflation indicators continues below 3.0%.",
        "In the Board's opinion, the most likely scenario is that inflation converges to the target once the transitory supply shocks fade, which is consistent with the forecasts by the technical staff and with the behavior of inflation expectations.Regarding economic activity, the Board continues to consider that the pace of growth will pick up in the second half of 2019.",
        "However, this acceleration would be insufficient to close the current spare capacity of the economy.",
        "In the same sense, the Members of the Board highlighted the increase in the unemployment rate.As for the external context, they highlighted several negative signals regarding global and regional growth.",
        "Specifically, they referred to the low growth of global investment and retail, as well as decreases in economic growth forecasts for Latin America.",
        "On the other hand, they agreed that more expansionary monetary policies, especially in the U, will strengthen an environment of liquidity for international financial conditions.The Board discussed the forecasts of the balance of payments, assessing both the vulnerabilities of the level of the current account deficit and the benefits of having most funding based on foreign direct investment.",
        "Some Board Members emphasized the country's need to increase exports other than energy and mining products consistently in order to balance the external accounts without major damage.In this context, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered, which it considers as moderately expansionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, March 22, 2019.",
        "In attendance were Alberto Carrasquilla Barrera, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; Juan José Echavarría, Governor of the Central Bank; and Board Members Gerardo Hernández Correa, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, José Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, Carolina Soto Losada, and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of the outlook on the macroeconomic situation by the technical staff of the Central Bank (section 1), followed by a review of the main discussion regarding monetary policy by the Board of Directors (section 2).Further detail on the macroeconomic situation prepared by the technical staff from the Central Bank will be presented in the quarterlyMonetary Policy Report for March 2019and in thestatistical annex (Only Available in Spanish)     CONTEXTThe external context anticipated for 2019 suggests an average growth of the country's trading partners that is expected to be somewhat lower this year than in 2018, and which is estimated to be around 2.3%, with international financial conditions that would be more favorable for emerging economies than those considered in the previous report.",
        "Particularly, the information suggests a weaker-than-expected economic performance in the US at the beginning of the year.",
        "This, together with the absence of inflationary pressures, would be postponing the increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate.On the other hand, sovereign risk premia in the region have declined in recent months.",
        "This, added with better financial conditions that those referred to in the previous report, would contribute to a slower-than-expected increase in the country's risk premia.The conditions for global supply and demand for oil do not suggest changes in the oil price forecast for 2019.",
        "Thus, the forecast of the average price for this year (USD 63 per barrel, Brent) has remained unchanged.The observed data suggest that the country's external imbalance increased somewhat more than expected in 2018, and that, in the external scenario described above, this trend would continue in 2019.",
        "Thus, the current account deficit for 2018 stood at 3.8% of GDP, and for 2019 it is estimated to stand between 3.9% and 4.7% of GDP, with 4.3% as the most likely scenario.",
        "This would take place in a scenario with a lower external income, in line with the expected setback in the terms of trade, a stable dynamism of imports consistent with the forecasts for domestic demand, and a less restrictive access to external financing than in the previous report.For the fourth quarter, growth figures were somewhat higher than had been forecast, with a more dynamic than expected domestic demand.",
        "This, above all, due to the good performance of public consumption and investment, which grew at a historically high rate for the second consecutive quarter.",
        "Contrary to expectations, this was due mainly to a strong accumulation of inventories and an unanticipated acceleration of construction spending, rather than to the performance of investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "The better behavior of domestic demand was offset by a net external demand that subtracted from GDP growth, consistent with a higher-than-expected widening of the trade deficit.The technical staff at the Central Bank projects an annual GDP growth that would increase again in the first quarter of 2019, and that would stand around 3.2% as the most likely figure.",
        "This would be consistent with a domestic demand that would maintain a good performance and an external demand that would subtract less from GDP.",
        "The figure estimated for the first quarter of the year would be closer to the estimation of the rate of potential growth of the Colombian economy.For 2019, the growth forecast was revised upwards slightly to 3.5%.",
        "Vis-à-vis the previous report, the forecast suggests a more dynamic domestic demand with a faster closing of the output gap.",
        "This behavior would be explained, mainly, by a greater thrust from investment, which would offset the deterioration anticipated in the terms of trade and external demand, within a context in which the Colombian economy would continue to have favorable conditions to access international financing.In Colombia, inflation continued to surprise downwards in the first months of the year, standing at 3.01% in February.",
        "The results have been lower than expected in all the subgroups analyzed (tradables, non-tradables, food, and regulated items).",
        "As a result, inflation excluding food and regulated items fell to 2.41%, and the average of core inflation indicators fell to 2.81%.The different measures of inflation expectations remain slightly above the target (3.0%).",
        "Analysts’ expectations stand between 3.2% and 3.3% to different horizons not over 24 months, and those embedded in public debt bonds stand around 3.3%.In all, observed inflation has been lower than expected, and stood at the target.",
        "However, some upward pressures on inflation in the second half of 2019 are not ruled out.",
        "The economic activity continues to recover at a better pace from levels that have been lower than the natural output of the economy.",
        "Monetary policy actions taken so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for GDP expansion.",
        "Uncertainty on global growth remains high     AND OPTIONSThe Board Members emphasized the excellent performance of inflation so far in 2019, particularly of core inflation indicators.",
        "The risks that had been advised regarding inflation this year due to El Niño and the impact of the increase in the minimum wage have not yet materialized.",
        "The conditions of international liquidity have relaxed, pushing away devaluation pressures, and, in any event, consumer prices of tradable products do not seem to be picking up the depreciation from the end of 2018.",
        "Thus, the outlook of inflation for 2019 is more favorable than had been considered at the end of last year.",
        "It is expected to continue at levels close to the target and has led to a reduction in inflation expectations in the market.As for the productive activity, the Board considered that the reactivation is still in progress, and GDP is expected to grow 3.5% in 2019.",
        "Notwithstanding, some of the Board Members expressed their concern over the pace at which such recovery has taken place, which is lower than they expected.",
        "Several members expressed their concern over the weakness of the labor market, whose causes are still uncertain.",
        "Also, the improvement in the risk indicators of the financial system was also noted.The members of the Board highlighted the consolidation of a broader environment of international liquidity, with which the Colombian economy is not expected to face external funding restrictions, nor increases in risk premia.",
        "In general, they expressed their concern about the outcome of the current account deficit in 2018 and its widening this year, which would be driven by the recovery of domestic demand and the low growth figures for the country’s trading partners.",
        "Some Board Members stressed that the composition of the current account and its financing somehow mitigates the external vulnerability.",
        "The fact that imports of capital goods and raw materials for productive processes are a dominant factor in the widening of the trade deficit as well as that financing comes mainly from foreign direct investment stood out as positive elements.In the context of an inflation figure very close to the target, with a reactivation process in progress (albeit slow) and an international environment with better liquidity conditions, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%, a level they considered moderately expansionist DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicatook place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, 20 December 2019.",
        "In attendance were Alberto Carrasquilla Barrera, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; Juan José Echavarría, Governor of the Central Bank; and Board Members Gerardo Hernández Correa, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, José Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, Carolina Soto Losada, and Roberto Steiner Sampedro.The main monetary policy discussions considered by the Board are summarized as follows:1.",
        "AND OPTIONSInflation results in November were in line with the forecasts of the technical staff for the end of the year and for 2020.",
        "Inflation is expected to stand at the higher part of the range defined by the Board of Directors (2.0% - 4.0%), and to converge to the 3.0% target in 2020.",
        "This convergence will start at the beginning of next year, inasmuch as the supply shocks that took place in 2019 begin fading.",
        "As indicated in the minutes of the October meeting, this convergence will be slower that had been expected initially due mainly to the performance of prices in the group of tradable goods.Regarding economic activity, the Board Members emphasized that in 2019 the Colombian economy will record its best performance (with an expected growth figure of 3.2%) since the negative shock caused by the fall in oil prices in -2014.",
        "Also, they emphasized that this growth figure will be the highest among the major Latin American economies.",
        "This positive dynamic is expected to continue in 2020, led by consumption and private investment, with which the gradual closing of the negative output gap would continue.On the other hand, the Board analyzed the recent results of the labor market, and particularly highlighted its concern about the high unemployment rate and its trend.The external context is still characterized by low growth and high liquidity in international markets, although with volatile flows towards emerging economies.",
        "As a consequence, international interest rates are expected to continue at low levels in 2020, while the external demand from the main trading partners is recovering slowly.The members of the Board discussed the projections of the balance of payments, assessing the potential vulnerabilities posed by the level of the current account deficit as well as the benefits of having a majority of funding based on foreign direct investment.",
        "They highlighted that this greater deficit takes place in an environment of lower external demand, wide international liquidity, and higher growth of the economy.In this context, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the current level of the benchmark interest rate for monetary policy intervention, which it considers as moderately expansionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicatook place in Bogotá on Thursday, October 31, 2019.",

        "They agreed with the projections of the technical staff, which suggest that inflation will stand away from the 3.0% target in the coming months, and that once the transitory supply shocks that have been taking place have faded, it will come close to it.",
        "This scenario is consistent with the behavior of agents’ expectations.",
        "Several members of the Board also pointed out that, according to the new information, the persistence of the depreciation of the exchange rate has affected the prices of some food items, while regulated prices have remained below the initial estimates.Although inflation is expected to converge to the target next year, some Board Members pointed out that there are risks that could cause this to happen more slowly than expected initially by the Central Bank's technical staff.Regarding economic activity, the Board emphasized that economic growth in Colombia exhibits a greater dynamism than the rest of the region.",
        "The information available suggests that the pace of growth has continued so far in the second half of the year, therefore the gradual closing of the negative output gap would continue.On the other hand, the complexities of the labor market continue to be studied by the technical staff, given the Board's concerns on its evolution and possible structural changes it could face.The Board highlighted the good performance of credit (particularly consumption credit) and the recovery of commercial loans.",
        "A full transmission of the benchmark interest rate to portfolio interest rates including consumption has been observed.As for the external context, the Board noted the low growth of global investment and trade, as well as the lower growth projections both globally and in the region.",
        "On the other hand, they agreed that the more expansionary monetary policies, particularly those of the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, will strengthen an environment of greater liquidity in international markets.The members of the Board discussed the projections of the balance of payments, assessing the potential vulnerabilities posed by the level of the current account deficit as well as the benefits of having a majority of funding based on foreign direct investment.",
        "They highlighted that this greater deficit takes place in an environment of lower external demand, wide international liquidity, and high growth of local investment.In this context, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the current level of the benchmark interest rate for monetary policy intervention, which it considers as moderately expansionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",

        "Particularly, the average growth of the country's trading partners projected for 2019 was revised slightly downward to 2.3%, taking into account a lower performance forecast for the euro zone and for some Latin American countries.",
        "The lower global demand and the strength of global oil production reduced the price that had been forecast for 2019.",
        "Thus, for 2019, an average price of USD 63 per barrel (Brent) is estimated.In this environment, the risks toward a more pronounced slowdown in global growth increased.",
        "This, together with the absence of inflationary pressures in advanced economies, suggests lower increases in external interest rates, particularly the Fed's.",
        "In Colombia, the lower price of oil and a somewhat weaker growth of the country’s trading partners would contribute to a gradual increase in sovereign risk premia.The new estimates suggest that the external imbalance would have widened in 2018, and that, in an external scenario as described above, this trend would continue in 2019.",
        "Thus, the current account deficit would have been close to 3.7% of GDP in 2018.",
        "For 2019, the current account deficit is estimated between 3.5% and 4.3% of GDP, with 3.9% as the most likely scenario, given the lower external income from exports of goods and a stable dynamism of imports.The information available for the fourth quarter suggests that the economy would have grown at a similar pace as in the third quarter.",
        "However, a slightly more dynamic domestic demand than forecast in the previous report is estimated.",
        "This is due to the fact that household consumption would be performing somewhat better because of spending on durable goods and that the positive impact observed on public consumption at the beginning of the year would be reversing more slowly than expected.",
        "The better performance of domestic demand is being offset by a net external demand that subtracts more from GDP, due to a lower growth of exports and higher imports.With this, the technical staff at the Central Bank forecasts that yearly GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 would be 2.7% as the most likely figure.",
        "Taking this into account, the GDP growth forecast of 2.6% in 2018 was maintained.",
        "The forecast range containing this projection is between 2.5% and 2.7%.",
        "Thus, in 2018, domestic demand would have expandedvis-à-vis2017 with positive contributions both from total consumption and investment.For 2019, GDP growth is forecast at around 3.4% within a range between 2.4% and 4.0%.",
        "This forecast considers lower prospects for international commodity prices (particularly oil) and a slightly weaker global economy.",
        "Despite this, the Colombian economy would continue to enjoy access to international financing, although this would take place in a context of high uncertainty and with marked downside risks.",
        "Additionally, it is considered that the changes introduced by theLey de financiamientorepresent a positive impact on investment that would boost growth, partly offsetting the fewer prospects in the external context.In Colombia, at the end of 2018, inflation stood at 3.18%, a surprise to the downside in the last month, mainly due to a more favorable performance of the prices of tradable and non-tradable inflation (excluding food and regulated items).",
        "As a result, inflation excluding food and regulated items fell to 2.64%, and the average of core inflation indicators fell to 3.03%.The different measures of inflation expectations remain above the target (3.0%).",
        "However, analysts’ expectations remain relatively stable in the survey for January, and inflation expectations for December 2019 are at 3.50%.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds lowered in January, and are currently around 3.6%.In summary, observed inflation has been lower than expected, and it maintains its convergence to the target.",
        "However, some upward pressures on inflation in the first part of 2019 are not ruled out, associated with the transitory effects of a weakEl Niñoand the estimated impact of the increase in the minimum wage.",
        "Economic activity continues to recover from levels of product lower than the productive capacity of the economy.",
        "Monetary policy actions taken so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for GDP expansion.",
        "Uncertainty about external financing conditions and the performance of some emerging economies remains high AND OPTIONSThe Board members emphasized the good performance of inflation at the end of 2018, especially of core inflation indicators.",
        "Although there are some risks associated to the increase in the minimum wage and the performance of some prices, the latter are limited and even have become weaker, especially due to the expectation of a low-intensityEl Niñoand the reduced impacts of the devaluation of the peso on consumer prices of tradable products so far.",
        "For this reason, the Board expressed its confidence in that inflation will stand once more at levels close to the target and below the inflation expectations of market agents.Regarding productive activity, the Board Members considered that the reactivation is still in progress, although still at a somewhat slow pace.",
        "Particularly, they highlighted the increase in investment, several months of growth in industrial production, increases in retail sales, and better consumer expectations.",
        "TheLey de financiamientowill contribute to the reactivation by means of higher levels of investment.",
        "Thus, they considered that economic growth in 2019 will be very close to 3.5%.Vis-à-visthe previous Board meeting, international liquidity has tended to improve.",
        "There has been a change in the monetary policy stance of the Fed towards a more moderate pace of increase of its interest rates, the price of oil has partially recovered, and the reactivation of the Latin American economy will boost demand for manufacturing exports and tourist activity in the country.",
        "In contrast to these positive trends, projections of economic growth in Europe and China have weakened, and there are still no signs of stopping the trade war between the United States and China.",
        "In any case, several Board Members expressed their concern about the expected widening of the current account deficit during the current year, although they all expressed their confidence in that it will not face financing problems, and also that it will be covered mostly by foreign direct investment.In the context of an inflation figure very close to the target, reactivation in progress, but slow, and an international environment that has improved albeit retaining many uncertainties, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the reference interest rate unaltered at 4.25%, a level considered by the members of the Board as moderately expansionist DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",

        "Thus, a slowdown is still expected for this year and the followingvis-á-vis2018, but with a growth figure still above the one observed for 2015 and 2016.",
        "However, there are still risks of a more pronounced slowdown in the advanced economies as well as in some emerging economies.The announcements made by the Fed in the last month suggest a greater perception of downside risks regarding growth of the United States, which, should they materialize, would lead to a more rapid and pronounced slowdown in the US economy that was forecasted in the previous report.",
        "This, together with the absence of inflationary pressures, has significantly reduced the likelihood of increases in the benchmark interest rate this year and the next.Given the above, a lower cost of international financing than the one anticipated earlier is expected.",
        "For Colombia, this should bring about a lower path for risk premia, with a slower convergence to its historical average.The price of oil has exceeded the forecasts made a month ago, largely as a result from the observed and expected supply constraints in the crude oil market.",
        "However, this is expected to be a transitory phenomenon, and the price of oil should return to levels around USD $62 per barrel in the coming months.",
        "Thus, a marginal upward revision of the oil price forecast for 2019 has been made in this report, for which an average price of USD $63.4 per barrel (Brent) is expected.The projections suggest that the country's external deficit as a share of GDP should continue to expand in 2019 as a consequence of a higher deficit in the balance of trade in goods.",
        "This is a result of lower-then-expected external sales and a better dynamics of imports, which reflect the higher expected growth in domestic demandvis-a-vis2018.",
        "The remaining items are expected to partially offset this estimated behavior of the trade balance.",
        "Thus, for 2019, the estimate of the current account deficit remains within a range between 3.9% and 4.7% of GDP, with 4.3% as the most likely figure.For the first quarter of 2019, the annual growth of the Colombian economy would continue to increase gradually.",
        "In this report, the technical staff confirms its GDP growth forecast in the first quarter of 2019 at 3.2%, a figure close to the long-term growth estimate for the Colombian economy.",
        "This would be consistent with domestic demand showing a greater dynamism than had been estimated in the previous report, while that of external demand would be subtracting more from GDP, in line with the figures of external trade and the projections of the balance of payments.For 2019, the technical staff forecasts GDP growth at 3.5%, a figure similar to the one presented a month ago.",
        "However, a greater dynamism of domestic demand and net exports is expected, which would subtract more from growth.",
        "The acceleration of GDP growth versus the 2.7% figure for all of 2018 would take place within a context of more favorable international financial conditions.Annual inflation in March was slightly higher than expected a month ago, and reached 3.21%.",
        "However, inflation results for the first quarter have been lower than forecast at the start of the year.",
        "In March, the increase in annual inflation was widespread, except for the non-tradable segment.",
        "Food inflation was driven by supply problems in the south of the country, while the tradable component rose slightly after continuous falls.",
        "Also, the generalized increase in the fees for public utilities explained the upward pressure exerted by the group of regulated items on the CPI.",
        "On the other hand, inflation excluding food and regulated items fell to 2.38% and the average of core inflation indicators remains below 3.0%.The different measures of inflation expectations remain slightly above the target (3.0%).",
        "Analysts’ expectations stand between 3.2% and 3.3% to different horizons not over 24 months, and those embedded in public debt bonds stand around 3.3%.In all, observed inflation is somewhat above the target, while the average core inflation indicators remains somewhat below 3.0%.",
        "The economic activity continues to recover at a better pace from levels that have been lower than the natural output of the economy.",
        "With this, and with the growth estimate for all of 2019, the output gap is expected to continue closing in the rest of the year.",
        "Monetary policy actions taken so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for GDP expansion.",
        "Uncertainty on global growth remains high    AND OPTIONSThe Board Members emphasized that the average of core inflation indicators not change in March, and continues below the 3.0% target.",
        "Although inflation accelerated this month, the members of the Board considered that, given the composition of this increase and the general dynamics of inflation, this change does not jeopardize reaching the target.",
        "On the other hand, inflation expectations continue to be close to the target.Regarding productive activity, the Board noted that there is no new information to modify their assessment from the previous meeting, characterized by a reactivation of output growth that is still in progress, and due to which GDP is expected to stand at 3.5% in 2019.",
        "Some Board Members continue to be concerned about the following issues: (i) the pace at which the reactivation is taking place; (ii) the poor dynamics of the labor market and uncertainty about its drivers; and (iii) the low growth of commercial loans (despite the improvement in risk indicators for the financial system).As for the external environment, the members of the Board stressed that, despite the news of better growth figures in the United States and China, an environment of lower external demand, wide international liquidity, and high volatility is still expected.",
        "With this, the Colombian economy would face neither external funding restrictions nor increases in its risk premia.In general, the members of the Board agreed on their concern regarding the current account deficit projected for 2019, which is driven by the recovering dynamism of domestic demand and the low growth figures of the country’s trading partners.",
        "They highlighted that the composition of the current account and its financing mitigate the external vulnerability to some extent.",
        "Two positive elements are the fact that the imports of capital goods and raw materials for productive processes are a dominant factor in the widening of the trade balance deficit, and that funding mainly comes from foreign direct investment.In the absence of substantial changes within the context of an inflation figure that is very close to the target, an ongoing (albeit slow) GDP growth reactivation, and an international environment that exhibits better liquidity conditions, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%, a level they consider moderately expansionist DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",

        "The average of core inflation indicators fell below the 3.0% target for the sixth consecutive month.",
        "Inflation in May (3.31%) was slightly higher than expected by the Central Bank's technical staff driven by the behavior of food prices due to climatic effects.",
        "The members of the Board considered that, given the composition of this increase and the general price dynamics, inflation will return to levels close to the target.",
        "According to the forecasts by the technical staff, it will reach the target in 2020.",
        "On the other hand, inflation expectations continue to be close to the target.Regarding economic growth, the members of the Board considered that the Colombian economy continues its recovery path, driven mainly by domestic demand.",
        "While the results of the GDP for the first quarter were lower than expected, the dynamics of economic activity continues to be positive, and is expected to pick up in the second half of the year.",
        "A factor of concern, however, is the negative results in terms of employment, as expressed by several members of the Board.",
        "Unemployment continues to increase due to low labor demand.In the international context, uncertainty associated with commercial and geopolitical tensions continues.",
        "At the same time, lower global growth projections have led several of the advanced economies to reverse their monetary policy stance.",
        "Particularly, the announcements by the Fed and the European Central Bank suggest that they could relax their monetary policy.The Board also expressed its concern about the external imbalance.",
        "The current account deficit for the first quarter of 2019 stood at 4.6% as a share of GDP, and forecasts suggest that it will end the year above 4.0%.",
        "Foreign direct investment and portfolio capital flows have widely financed the current account.",

        "Projections show that over the next few months inflation will remain away from the 3.0% target, but in August a reversal of its upward trend was observed.",
        "In the Board's opinion, the most likely scenario is that inflation converges to the target once the transitory supply shocks fade, which is consistent with the forecasts by the technical staff and with the behavior of inflation expectations.Regarding economic activity, the Board Members emphasized that, contrasting the data from the rest of the region, economic growth in Colombia has exhibited a greater dynamism throughout the first half of the year.",
        "They also believe that there will be an acceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second half of 2019.",
        "However, this acceleration would be insufficient to close the current spare capacity of the economy.",
        "The members of the Board reiterated their concern about the performance of the labor market, albeit noting that urban indicators have slightly improved.On this occasion, they highlighted the good performance of credit, particularly that of consumption, and the recovery of the commercial loans.",
        "Some Board Members highlighted that a full transmission of the policy interest rate to portfolio interest rates including consumption can already be observed.As for the external context, they highlighted several negative signals regarding global and regional growth.",
        "Specifically, they referred to the low growth of investment and international trade, as well as to decreases in economic growth projections for Latin America.",
        "On the other hand, they agreed that more expansionary monetary policies, especially from the Fed and the European Central Bank, will strengthen an environment of increased liquidity in international financial conditions.The members of the Board discussed the forecasts of the balance of payments, assessing both the vulnerabilities of the level of the current account deficit and the benefits of having most funding based on foreign direct investment.In this context, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered, which it considers as moderately expansionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%."

    "2021": [
        "On September 30, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) decided unanimously to begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.",
        "The board voted 4-3 to increase the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.0%, with three dissenting members voting for a 50-point increase.The unanimous decision to raise interest rates and begin normalizing monetary policy took into account the following considerations:Third-quarter indicators suggest renewed dynamism in GDP growth following a partial interruption in the second quarter caused by roadblocks and a third wave of the -19 pandemic.",
        "Positive performance in domestic demand, driven by private consumption, and a strengthening in external demand were the most important factors in this recovery.",
        "An improvement in terms of trade and recovery in investment also contributed to economic growth.As a result, the technical staff revised its GDP growth forecasts upward to 8.6% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022, suggesting smaller excess productive capacity that would be expected to tighten at a faster rate than previously anticipated.Annual inflation continued to rise in August, exceeding projections at 4.4%.",
        "Core inflation measured as the CPI excluding food and regulated items was 2.3%.",
        "Inflationary pressures have originated largely in local and international supply shocks, which are expected to be transitory but whose durations may vary, possibly limiting short-term convergence to the target rate.",
        "A partial withdrawal of some price relief measures accentuated inflationary pressures.In this context, the technical staff revised its inflation forecasts upward to 4.5% for the end of 2021 and 3.5% for the end of 2022.",
        "Surveys and other recent indicators suggest that inflation expectations have increased, though in the medium term these remain close to the target.The technical staff forecasts that the current account deficit will increase from 3.6% of GDP in 2020 to 5.0% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022.",
        "The widening of the deficit reflects greater dynamism in demand compared to domestic supply and is in line with a decline in household savings as private consumption recovers.",
        "This imbalance is being financed by capital flows, notably in foreign investment (which has recovered significantly compared to 2020) and public sector resources through credit and portfolio investment.BDBR's risk evaluation considered the possibility of a worsening of the pandemic that could affect recovery in domestic and external demand.",
        "It also allowed for the possibility that deviations in expected inflation compared to the target could become persistent and lead to indexation at higher rates of inflation.",
        "The political dilemma inherent in these risks was discussed in detail.Considering the clear signs of economic recovery, there was consensus among the board members over the need to begin a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus and prevent a de-anchoring of expected inflation tied to indexation processes.",
        "The board members agreed that the factors driving inflation have been largely due to supply shocks related to disruptions in supply chains, high costs of maritime transport, the effect of blockades on productive processes, and the withdrawal of price relief measures, which would not respond to increases in interest rates.",
        "The board members also noted that the monetary policy stance has become more expansive as expected inflation has increased, distancing the real policy interest rate from its natural level.",
        "Given the above, four board members voted in favor of a 25-basis point interest rate increase, while three board members voted for a 50-point increase.The board members in the majority emphasized the temporary character of the current pressures on prices, highlighting the fact that expected inflation remains anchored to the target in the medium term.",
        "They noted that this would provide flexibility for a more gradual approach in adjusting monetary policy, and also stressed that adjustment in the labor market has not yet been completed.",
        "Finally, they highlighted the remaining uncertainty that surrounds the projections and noted the potential worsening of the pandemic due to the Delta variant.The three board members who voted for a 50-point increase noted that expected inflation for the basket excluding foods is already above the 3% target in the most recent surveys.",
        "They suggested that postponing adjustments in the policy rate could increase the need for larger increases in the future and underlined the fact that more significant increases in the benchmark rate at the beginning of the normalization process would reaffirm the Bank's commitment to the target and help moderate increases in expected inflation.",
        "They also signaled their uncertainty over how transitory or permanent the shocks to inflation will prove to be.Finally, these board members highlighted the experience of managing monetary policy in 2020, when the BDBR opted to begin reducing interest rates in a relatively aggressive manner in response to the onset of the pandemic.",
        "In retrospect, this may have been a contributing factor to the success of monetary stimulus in economic recovery, as suggested by current GDP growth figures.",
        "After a thorough evaluation of the most recent indicators of economic activity, inflation, the credit market and international financial conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) decided unanimously on March 26 to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.The monetary policy discussion centered on the following factors:Annual inflation in February 2021 was 1.56%, while inflation on foods was 5.02% and the average for core inflation indicators was 1.21%.",
        "The directors highlighted continued stability in expected inflation, which survey results project at 2.7% and 3.1% for the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively.",
        "While the directors supported the technical staff's forecast of low inflation in the first quarter followed by an acceleration over the rest of the year, they noted that observed inflation in February had exceeded both the technical staff's and market analysts' expectations.The directors also noted mixed signals regarding economic activity.",
        "While GDP growth in 2020 (-6.8%) was slightly above the technical staff's expectations, a resurgence of the pandemic and the subsequent implementation of additional quarantine measures led to a deceleration in economic activity in January.",
        "By contrast, several indicators suggested recovery in February and a slight improvement in the economic outlook for the remainder of the year.",
        "As a result, the technical staff has revised its growth projection for 2021 up to 5.2%, reflecting expectations shared by a diverse set of market analysts and international agencies, which have also recently revised their 2021 projections upward.Unfortunately, and despite this relative improvement in the growth outlook, weakness in Colombia's labor market has persisted, and in January a recovery in employment observed in previous months came to a halt.International financial conditions continue to be broadly favorable amid high levels of global liquidity.",
        "However, a confluence of recent factors suggests that conditions on the margin may have tightened somewhat.",
        "These include an increase in medium- and long-term interest rates in international financial markets and increased inflation expectations in the United States following its recent approval of a fiscal stimulus package.In this context, the directors highlighted the importance of Colombia's congress to approve a fiscal adjustment program aimed at guaranteeing the sustainability of the public finances, and which would allow Banco de la República to maintain an expansive monetary policy stance without compromising macroeconomic stability.The directors also noted the full transmission of the policy interest rate on commercial credit rates, a portfolio now showing growth similar to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Consumer and mortgage interest rates have also fallen, though at a slower pace.",
        "As expected, both the default portfolio and liability provisions have increased as certain debt relief measures have been withdrawn, though this has come without risk to the stability of the financial system.Despite improvement on several counts, significant economic uncertainty persists.",
        "Some of the directors emphasized the adverse effects on economic activity that would result from a third wave of the pandemic, which, should it materialize, could raise the need for additional monetary stimulus.By contrast, some directors highlighted a risk in the opposite direction associated with a larger and more rapid tightening of international financial conditions in light of a loosening of fiscal policy in the United States.",
        "This would have particular relevance in the event that Colombia's congress does not approve a fiscal adjustment plan along the lines of the one currently being prepared by the national government.",
        "DECISIONThe BDBR decided unanimously to hold Banco de la República's benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "After a thorough evaluation of the most recent indicators of economic activity, inflation and international financial conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) voted by a 6-1 majority to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%, with one dissenting vote in favor of a 25-basis point reduction.The monetary policy discussion centered on the following factors:First-quarter economic activity maintained the positive trend observed since the second half of 2020 despite new mobility restrictions put in place in January and again at the end of March.",
        "As a result, the technical staff has revised its central GDP growth forecast for 2021 upward from 5.2% to 6.0%.",
        "However, additional -19 outbreaks of unknown intensity and duration, as well as uncertain fiscal conditions, make it necessary to consider alternative risk scenarios that, should they materialize, would instead point to growth between 3.6% and 5.2%.Total annual inflation and inflation excluding food and regulated items fell less than projected by the technical staff and market analysts, registering 1.51% and 0.94% through March, respectively.",
        "Changes in inflation are likely to continue to be affected by ample excess productive capacity, which should progressively reduce over time.",
        "Given the above, both the technical staff's inflation forecast and expected inflation based on analyst surveys appear to be in line with a convergence to the 3% target inflation rate in 2021 and 2022.The total national unemployment rate in March was 14.2%, while the figure for Colombia's 13 largest cities was 16.8%.",
        "Colombia's national statistics agency (DANE) also reported an increase in monetary poverty of 6.8 percentage points from 2019 to 2020, rising to 42.5%.",
        "High unemployment and the increase in the poverty rate provide grounds for the current, historically low policy interest rate.A highly expansionary fiscal policy in the United States suggests that international financial conditions may grow less favorable.",
        "While financing conditions currently remain loose, long-term interest rates have increased and the Colombian peso has sustained some depreciation pressures that, while common to a majority of Latin American countries, have been more accentuated than elsewhere in the region.Initiating a gradual process of fiscal consolidation that addresses the effects of the pandemic on public debt (now estimated to be around 15% of GDP) will be necessary to ensure public sector access to financing sources at reasonable costs.",
        "Failing to successfully undertake such a process could significantly limit the space available for monetary policy to continue supporting recovery in economic activity and employment.The members of the board who voted in favor of holding interest rates weighed the positive and negative signals from the economy without identifying a net trend in either direction that would justify a change in what they consider a sufficiently expansionary monetary policy stance.",
        "Economic performance in the first quarter was a notable positive considered by the group, as were forecasts for inflation and expected inflation that pointed to a convergence with the 3% target in 2021 and 2022.Among the negative factors considered by the group were a recent worsening of the -19 pandemic and high levels of uncertainty surrounding potential future waves of the virus.",
        "In response, the board members signaled the need to closely monitor any new information related to the pandemic and its potential effects on economic activity.",
        "They also underlined the risks that could result from a steepening of the yield curve on government debt, which could reduce international investors' appetite for emerging markets and make access to capital markets more difficult.Some of the board members noted that the slow pace of economic activity was reflected in reduced demand for credit that, together with an increase in perceived risk, has led to an increased share of investments, particularly in public debt, among financial intermediaries' asset holdings.",
        "This represents an example of the displacement effect, associated with a deterioration in fiscal conditions.All of the board members shared concern over the negative environment created by uncertainty surrounding the fiscal adjustment project, the failure of which could affect macroeconomic stability and investor confidence and slow economic recovery.",
        "They also warned that a failure to implement a fiscal adjustment could limit the space available for a counter-cyclical monetary policy.The member of the board who voted in favor of a 25-basis point reduction concurred with many of the points mentioned above.",
        "However, this board member also underlined that a situation in which the fiscal deficit is significantly higher than the external deficit in the current account suggests significant excess in private savings, translating to low levels of investment and private consumption and thereby limiting the space for economic growth.",
        "The board member also noted that private sector credit levels have barely increased in the last year despite efforts to inject liquidity, and that this has come as private sector deposits have increased 15%.",
        "Given the above, the board member called for an additional loosening of monetary policy, alongside new measures to promote medium- and long-term financing.",
        "On October 29, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) decided unanimously to continue to normalize monetary policy.",
        "The board voted 5-2 to increase the policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.5%, with two dissenting members voting for a 25-point increase.The decision took into account the following considerations:Economic activity has recovered faster than previously anticipated, a reflection primarily of strengthening domestic demand that has benefited from monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policies implemented since the start of the pandemic.",
        "The persistence of favorable international financial conditions, improvements in international demand, and an increase in terms of trade are expected to continue to drive output recovery over the rest of the year and into 2022.",
        "As a result, the technical staff has revised its GDP growth projections upward to 9.8% for 2021 and 4.7% for 2022.Annual inflation in September was above expectations at 4.51%, in large part due to the price behavior of foods and regulated items.",
        "Increased prices and international costs have created upward pressure on various baskets, as have the partial lapse of some price relief measures implemented in 2020 and the increase in domestic demand and consequent reduction in excess capacity.",
        "Given the persistence of external shocks, the possible effects of indexation on some prices, and the improvement in economic activity, the technical staff revised its year-end inflation forecasts upward to 4.9% in 2021 and 3.6% in 2022.Seasonally adjusted figures from the national statistics agency's integrated household survey (GEIH) show a recovery of 5.2 million jobs lost since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total recovery to 88.4%.",
        "Close to 1 million jobs were created in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "The recovery has led to a decline in seasonally adjusted unemployment rates, which in September fell to 12.6% nationally and 14.1% in Colombia's 13 largest cities.",
        "While unemployment levels remain high, the continued recovery in economic activity suggests that favorable labor market trends should continue in the coming months.The current account deficit is expected to grow to 5.3% of GDP in 2021, primarily as a reflection of significant growth in domestic demand, which has incentivized imports.",
        "An expected recovery in earnings for businesses with international investment, as the result of economic recovery and higher coal and oil prices, would also contribute to deficit growth.",
        "Deterioration in the balance of payments represents a source of vulnerability, particularly as international financial conditions could become less favorable more quickly than recently anticipated.In their unanimous decision to continue the gradual process of monetary policy normalization, the members of the board agreed that the monetary stimulus deployed to address the economic effects of the pandemic had largely achieved its objectives, as indicated by the significant increase in domestic demand, which has been the primary driver of economic recovery.",
        "However, increased inflation and inflation expectations, and the progressive reduction of excess productive capacity, suggest that maintaining monetary stimulus at current levels could compromise macroeconomic sustainability.",
        "The board members also concurred that monetary policy remains accommodative despite the beginning of the normalization process.Having agreed in their general diagnosis of current macroeconomic conditions, the board differed in its view of the speed with which the normalization process should proceed; five board members voted in favor of a 50-basis point increase to the policy interest rate, while two board members voted for a 25-point increase.In recommending a more pronounced increase to the policy interest rate, the majority noted the coexistence of increased inflation and expected inflation alongside a marked increase in economic activity.",
        "Some members of this group emphasized the notable recovery in private consumption, supported by abundant credit and interest rates that have largely reflected changes to the policy rate, which remains negative in real terms and will continue to provide sustained support for economic recovery.",
        "Other members of this group expressed doubts that the productive capacity of the economy could sustain current levels of demand growth in the medium term, which could give rise to internal and external imbalances.",
        "Recent data suggests that the output gap could close faster than previously expected.",
        "At the same time, the accelerated increase in demand could induce larger external imbalances as international financial conditions tighten.",
        "The majority also expressed concern over the increase in expected inflation and reiterated that, in this context, indexation in 2022 could present a risk to price stability.",
        "This group agreed that a larger increase in the interest rate was appropriate in this instance, suggesting that a smaller increase could risk the need for a more restrictive monetary policy stance in the future.The board members who voted for a 25-basis point increase noted persistent uncertainty related over to the evolution of the pandemic, in light of the appearance of new strains of -19 in some countries.",
        "They added that the high recent level of consumption may not be sustainable, as it has been based on the deaccumulation of savings accrued during the height of the pandemic.",
        "These board members highlighted that significant gaps in employment and investment remain, compared to pre-pandemic levels, and suggested that cash flow problems still being faced by many Colombian companies could be accentuated by an accelerated increase in the interest rate.",
        "While they expressed concern over high levels of inflation, these board members noted that part of the increase could be understood as an inevitable adjustment to changes in international prices and the economic effects of the pandemic and recent roadblocks in some parts the country, and as such should not be cause for excessive alarm.",
        "They also noted their concern that Colombia may not be making the investments necessary to sustain high levels of growth in the long term.",
        "Finally, these board members expressed concern over the impact that a more pronounced increase in the policy rate could have on the dynamism of credit levels, particularly for those segments that were most affected during the critical phases of the pandemic, such as small and micro-businesses.",
        "After a thorough evaluation of economic activity, inflation and international financial conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) voted unanimously on June 28 to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.The monetary policy discussion centered on the following considerations:After growth outpaced expectations in the first quarter, economic activity remained dynamic in April, growing at an annual rate of 29.2% in the seasonally adjusted and calendar-corrected series from DANE's monthly economic tracking indicator (ISE, by its acronym in Spanish).",
        "A low basis of comparison from 2020 had a significant impact on this result, which exceeded the same figure from March by 0.3% despite new mobility restrictions in some cities in response to additional outbreaks of -19.A third wave of the coronavirus and, in particular, roadblocks and other disruptions to public order will likely be reflected in a deceleration of economic growth in the second quarter.",
        "However, the economic recovery observed through April led the Bank's technical staff to increase its growth forecast for 2021 from 6% to 6.5% in the central forecast scenario.",
        "Even in this case, GDP would be expected to remain below 2019 levels this year.",
        "Meanwhile, recovery in employment has slowed and unemployment rates and levels of informality remain high.Annual inflation in May exceeded projections at 3.3%.",
        "Upward pressures came primarily from foods (9.52%), especially perishable foods (18.16%), as the result of supply challenges in multiple cities.",
        "Inflation on regulated items also accelerated (4.2%) due to the partial lapse of price relief measures on utility rates put in place in 2020, as well as due to an increase in fuel prices.",
        "Core inflation excluding food and regulated items (1.56%) remained below the target and was similar to projections.",
        "Some inflationary pressures from May could show a degree of persistence, which could keep annual inflation above the target until the first quarter of 2022.",
        "Such persistence would be the result of the time required to re-establish production affected by the roadblocks, as well as an increase in international food prices and high logistics and transportation costs.",
        "Expected inflation, which remains anchored to the target, could be affected by this scenario.The BDBR observed that growth in foreign demand has been higher than expected, leading to increased dynamism in the trade of goods despite deteriorating value chains and a significant increase in raw materials prices and freight costs.",
        "Although foreign demand and terms of trade have improved, the 2021 forecast for the current account deficit has been revised upward.",
        "This comes in line with greater dynamism in domestic demand, reflected in increased imports and an increase in the earnings that businesses with foreign investment in Colombia send abroad.The BDBR considered the possibility that the U Federal Reserve may bring forward the normalization of its monetary policy in response to unexpectedly high inflation and the persistence of inflationary pressures.",
        "If this were to occur, international financial conditions could become less favorable and the risk appetite for investment in emerging markets could be affected.",
        "The space for Colombia to maintain a monetary policy as expansive as the current stance could be limited in these circumstances.The BDBR reiterated its view on the need for an adequate fiscal adjustment as a necessary condition for the public sector to maintain access to financing at reasonable costs.",
        "Should this fail to occur, the space for monetary policy to continue supporting recovery in economic activity and employment would eventually be reduced.In their policy discussion, the board members agreed that Colombia's current macroeconomic scenario is changing in a highly uncertain environment.",
        "As the economy recovers and excess capacity is reduced, the labor market continues to be loose and inflation has increased.",
        "However, the board members emphasized that a large part of the increase in inflation in May came as the result of a supply shock, as suggested by the fact that the average of the indicators of core inflation remained below the target rate.",
        "One member of the board expressed surprise that inflation in the basic family basket remains so low despite the fact that installed excess capacity is decreasing and that global commodity prices are rising.",
        "The member raised the possibility that this could change in the months ahead.",
        "Another board member noted that disruptions in the supply chain both domestically and internationally could take time to normalize, which in the meantime would affect production costs.",
        "The monetary policy challenge under these conditions is to avoid stagflation.Given that expected inflation remains anchored to the target, the board members concurred in holding the benchmark interest rate, subject to developments in the months ahead and keeping a close eye on the evolution of fiscal and external financial conditions.The board members also noted that the expansive monetary policy stance adopted last year has been transmitted to a large degree on distinct credit modalities, and that in some cases interest rate reductions have even exceeded changes to the policy rate.",
        "As was to be expected, this has been tempered to some degree by an increase in perceived risk on the part of some financial agents.",
        "As a result, a more effective transmission of the relaxation in monetary policy has been limited in some specific cases, such as in microcredit.",
        "One board member expressed concern over the insufficient level of financing being received by the private sector, and the degree to which increased public financing needs could be displacing private financing.Finally, the board members examined the recent evolution of the exchange rate and concluded that idiosyncratic factors, including a credit downgrade from one ratings agency and uncertainty related to recent social unrest, have influenced its performance.",
        "The board members noted, however, that an improvement in the terms of trade and, especially, an increase in oil prices have mitigated downward exchange rate pressures.",
        "Given the potential for less favorable international financial conditions in the future, they reiterated the need for fiscal adjustment as a means of providing greater assurance on this front.",
        "The Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicaraised the policy rate by 50 basis points (bp) thus putting it at 3.0% in a 4-3 majority decision at its December 17 session.",
        "Three members voted for a 75 bp increase.The decision took the following aspects into account:Annual inflation in November increased 68 bp with respect to what was registered in October, reaching 5.26%.",
        "This increase was above the expectations of the technical staff and the market.",
        "Annual core inflation (excluding food and regulated items) also showed an upward trend as it stood at 2.54%, 52 bp above the October figure.",
        "While the main upward pressure came from the increase in food prices, other CPI groups also registered increases.",
        "As a result, the inflation forecast was revised to 5.3% for 2021 and 3.7% for 2022.GDP continued to grow strongly in the fourth quarter, as shown by leading indicators such as energy consumption, mobility, banking transactions, and air and land transportation.",
        "Industrial, commercial, and consumer confidence indicators also remain at favorable levels.",
        "Economic activity is still driven by domestic demand, particularly by private and public consumption.",
        "Taking this into consideration, the technical staff ratified its 9.8% GDP growth projection for 2021, which would place economic output at levels higher than before the pandemic.The current account deficit is likely to reach 5.6% of the GDP in 2021, two percentage points higher than in 2020.",
        "The widening of this imbalance is partly due to the impact of domestic demand on imports, which has only been partially offset by the rebound in exports.",
        "In addition, the net factor income imbalance has increased, thus reflecting an improvement in the profits of companies with foreign capital.",
        "These are higher due to the improved pace of economic activity.",
        "For 2022, the current account deficit is expected to drop to 4.9% of GDP.",
        "The external imbalance has been financed with greater foreign direct investment resources and public sector capital flows in an international financial context that is beginning to become tighter with widespread increases in interest rates in emerging economies and the expected tightening of monetary policy in the United States.Inflation expectations, both those obtained from surveys and those inferred from the difference between fixed and indexed yields on public debt instruments, have been rising and are currently above the 3.0% target even for the medium term.",
        "This increases the risk of inducing indexation processes at higher inflation levels.All the Board Members agreed that the increases in inflation and inflation expectations and the high rate of economic activity, which has been reducing spare capacity, warranted the continued withdrawal of monetary stimulus.",
        "In this context, four members of the Board voted for a 50 bp and three for a 75 bp increase in the policy rate.The Board members who voted for the 50 bp increase believed that while these factors justify the continued withdrawal of monetary stimulus, they not think it would be advisable to fast-track an interest rate adjustment.",
        "In support of this, they expressed doubts about the sustainability of the pace at which domestic demand is picking up due to the reduction in household savings, the sluggishness of investment, the employment recovery lag, and the limits to consumption of durable and semi-durable goods.",
        "They also underlined the fact that economic recovery has not been uniform, as shown by investment items that have been slow to recover and are still at considerably lower levels than in the pre-pandemic period.",
        "Finally, they believe it is advisable to, as far as possible, gradually increase interest rates in order to avoid the financial tensions that sharp and sudden changes could cause in the markets.The group that advocated a 75 bp increase stated that the surge in inflation and the increase in inflation expectations were of concern not only because of the level they had reached, but also because the factors that generated them were beginning to take on a structural nature given the inability of supply to meet the needs of the market's increased demand.",
        "They added that the recent raise in the minimum wage well over the usual practice of basing it on actual inflation and productivity gains creates a perception in public opinion that nominal increases well-above the inflation target are normal.",
        "This could contribute to de-anchoring inflation expectations and makeBanco de la República'stask of controlling inflation more demanding.",
        "This, together with the notable increase in the different current and expected inflation indicators since the previous Board meeting, makes it advisable for this group to quicken the pace of monetary policy tightening.Finally, the Board of Directors as a whole reiterated its commitment to the 3.0% annual inflation target and reaffirmed that it will continue to adopt the decisions required to ensure the convergence of inflation towards this target.",
        "En su sesión del 29 de enero, la Junta Directiva del Banco de la República revisó la última información disponible sobre actividad económica, inflación y condiciones internacionales.",
        "La Junta decidió mantener la tasa de política After considering the most recent information available on economic activity, inflation, and international conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on January 29 held the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "Five board members voted in favor of leaving the rate unchanged, while two voted for a 25 bp reduction.The monetary policy discussion centered on the following factors:Year-end inflation in 2020 was 1.6%, while the average of core inflation indicators was 1.3%.",
        "Expected inflation remained stable at 2.7% for 2021 and 3.1% for 2022.",
        "The Bank's technical staff projects low levels of inflation for the first quarter of 2021 before an acceleration through the remainder of the year.Fourth-quarter indicators suggested a continued recovery in economic activity at the end of 2020 that is expected to persist over the course of this year.External conditions continue to favor financing of the Colombian economy amid high levels of global liquidity, low central bank interest rates, and significant optimism over the deployment of -19 vaccines.The Colombian financial system continues to offer favorable and stable conditions for solvency and liquidity.",
        "In this context, the credit portfolio and interest rates continue to respond to monetary policy stimulus.The directors highlighted persistent uncertainty so far this month related to the economic effects of additional waves of the pandemic.For the majority, the main arguments in favor of holding the current expansionary monetary policy stance centered on the need to focus on medium-term measures of expected inflation and its deviation from the target.",
        "Several directors in the majority noted that despite low measures of inflation and the prospect of a further reduction in coming months, this trend could be expected to begin to reverse in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Given medium-term inflation expectations that remain close to the target and information related to economic activity that points to recovery, they considered a deepening of the current expansionary policy stance unnecessary.One of the directors in the majority, by contrast, considered it possible that inflation could settle at a lower trajectory and that market expectations could account for this view.",
        "However, this director suggested it would be prudent to wait for further information in order to determine if this scenario comes to fruition.Those in the majority group placedsignificantweight on signals of instability that could be sent to markets through frequent and potentiallyinverse changesto the benchmark interest rate.",
        "Finally, they suggested that it would be appropriate to wait for further information regarding key economic indicators.A minority group of directors recommended a 25 bp reduction in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They emphasized that recent inflation data has been at historic lows and anticipated a lower inflation path on the forecast horizon, which would open additional space to support economic recovery through a more expansive policy stance.",
        "They argued that maintaining the current posture could lead to a less expansionary real policy interest rate than currently exists.This group also signaled their concern over the aggressive new wave of the coronavirus present in January and its possible effects, together with additional closures and restrictions, on economic activity and the output gap.",
        "In their judgment this created greater uncertainty over the magnitude of potential recovery in December, and as a result they considered that there was space available for a reduction of the policy rate.",
        "They underlined that external conditions and Colombia's continued access to international financial markets would also offer a margin to adjust the interest rate downward.Monetary Policy DecisionThe BDBR decided by majority to hold the Banco de la República's benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "After a thorough evaluation of economic activity, inflation and international financial conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) on July 30 voted by majority to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.The monetary policy discussion centered on the following considerations:Leading indicators suggest a return to the prevailing growth trajectory after a recent slowdown in economic activity caused by roadblocks and other disruptions to public order.",
        "These indicators include figures from June and July suggesting significant recoveries in ground freight transportation, unregulated energy demand and the consumer confidence index.",
        "As a result, the technical staff has revised its growth projection for 2021 upward from 6.5% to 7.5%.Inflation increased from below 2.0% in the first quarter to 3.30% in May and 3.63% in June.",
        "This acceleration was due primarily to shocks in supply, including increases in perishable food prices caused by roadblock-related supply difficulties in some cities, higher inflation on regulated items due to the partial lapse of price relief measures on utility rates, and an increase in fuel prices.",
        "External factors, including increased international prices for basic goods and raw materials and higher logistics and maritime transportation costs, accentuated these pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation excluding food and regulated items continued at low levels (1.87% in June).The global economy has continued to recover thanks to progress in vaccination programs and fiscal and monetary stimulus that has driven growth in advanced economies and some emerging markets.",
        "However, new variants of the coronavirus continue to pose a significant risk to the world economy.",
        "Meanwhile, inflationary pressures in the United States and other advanced economies suggest the risk of a return to less favorable international financing conditions.The technical staff projects an increase in the current account deficit from 3.4% of GDP in 2020 to 4.5% of GDP in 2021.",
        "This would be consistent with the expected recovery in domestic demand, which would be driven by household consumption and investment and by increases in spending and the public deficit.",
        "This imbalance should begin to correct in 2022 thanks to a fiscal reform package recently presented by the national government for consideration in Congress, the rapid implementation of which will be critical.Given recent inflation behavior and its possible persistence, as well as the previously noted upward revision to the growth forecast, the board members concurred that the space available to maintain current levels of monetary stimulus is closing.",
        "In response, the policy discussion centered on whether to delay or to proceed immediately with a decision to partially withdraw monetary stimulus that the economy has been receiving since the start of the pandemic.Five board members advocated in favor of holding the policy interest rate.",
        "They outlined their support for the eventual normalization of monetary policy but suggested that continued uncertainty on a variety of economic fronts created a need for more information prior to modifying the current monetary policy stance.Among the arguments supporting their position, this group of board members highlighted that the output gap remains in negative territory and that gross domestic product has not yet returned to 2019 levels.",
        "This has been reflected in an unusually high unemployment rate, and a remaining need to recover a significant number of jobs lost as a result of the pandemic.",
        "This group expressed its concern that the events of May could have caused more significant damage to the means of production than has so far been measured, and that as a result it would be prudent to wait for second-quarter GDP figures prior to making any decision to raise rates.",
        "The group also noted that a portion of inflationary pressures have originated in supply shocks, which should correct with the return to pre-pandemic production and mobility conditions.",
        "They highlighted that core inflation continues to be low and that expected inflation at two years remains anchored to the target.",
        "They also noted that the appearance of new, more contagious variants of -19 could produce significant risks to recovery in international demand, and that, should these strains of the virus take hold in Colombia, they could weaken the recovery in domestic demand and economic growth.",
        "These board members also expect loose financial conditions to persist for some time, in line with recent Fed and ECB announcements.One of these board members further underlined that a significant cause of the observed increase in inflation has been in higher costs due to readjustments in production chains and domestic and international transportation, and that an increase in the interest rate would not be very effective in addressing these issues.",
        "This member also suggested that the private sector has over-adjusted to the fiscal imbalance and that an increase in rates would affect activity levels more so than prices.",
        "Additionally, the member noted that it would be desirable to improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism, creating conditions for more significant growth in private sector credit.Two board members argued that recent inflation behavior and its possible persistence, as well as the upward revision to the growth forecast, suggest that monetary stimulus should not be postponed.",
        "They advocated for a 25-basis point increase to the benchmark interest rate.In support of this proposal, the board members highlighted that the output gap, though still negative, has been tightening and that this process would accelerate in consonance with the technical staff's upward revision to the growth forecast.",
        "These board members highlighted that expected inflation for this year and next have been increasing and that, while supply factors have been significant in explaining price increases, demand and external factors should not be ignored.",
        "They also expressed their concern over the increase in the current account deficit projected by the technical staff and noted the upward inclination of the technical staff's inflation and growth projections, positing that a possible de-anchoring of inflation expectations or effects on the exchange rate could introduce additional pressures on prices.",
        "Finally, they suggested that any delay in a necessary adjustment to the interest rate could lead to the need for a more forceful monetary policy reaction in the future,  sacrificing the benefits of a gradual adjustment."

    "2020": [
        "The ordinary meeting of the Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicatook place on 31 January 2020 in Bogotá In attendance were the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Alberto Carrasquilla Barrera, the Governor of the Central Bank, Juan José Echavarría Soto, and Board Members Gerardo Hernández Correa, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Carolina Soto Losada, and Roberto Steiner Sampedro.The main monetary policy discussions considered by the Board are summarized as follows AND OPTIONSInflation in December 2019 (3.8%) was in line with the projections by the technical staff.",
        "For 2020, the Board Members anticipate that inflation will continue its convergence toward the 3% target, given that supply shocks continue to fade.",
        "They also expect lower pressures on the level of prices from the exchange rate, in an environment of low international interest rates and reduced risk premia.",
        "This could be affected by the economic effects of the recently declared international health emergency.The Board considers that economic activity in 2020 will maintain a positive dynamics, led by the private sector, with which the gradual closing of the negative output gap would continue.",
        "They stressed that such dynamism is framed in an environment of low interest rates, wide credit conditions, and stimuli to private investment.The Board highlighted that the external context is still characterized by low growth and high liquidity of international markets, added to the uncertainty about the already mentioned effects of Coronavirus.",
        "They agreed that the partial trade agreement between USA and China, as well as the finalization of the Brexit, reduce the likelihood of further deterioration of global trade.",
        "As a consequence, international interest rates are expected to continue at low levels in 2020, while the external demand from the country’s main trading partners recovers, albeit slowly.The members of the Board discussed the projections of the balance of payments, assessing the potential vulnerabilities posed by the level of the current account deficit as well as the benefits of having a majority of funding based on foreign direct investment.",
        "They highlighted that this greater deficit takes place in an environment of lower external demand, wide international liquidity, and higher growth of the economy.In this context, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the current level of the monetary policy intervention rate, which the majority of Board Members considers is still moderately expansionary DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",
        "The Coronavirus pandemic has generated a collapse in global economic activity.",
        "Additionally, Colombia has been severely affected by the collapse in the international price of oil.The members of the Board highlighted the importance of the measures taken in recent weeks to ensure a wide and timely provision of liquidity to the economy, both in pesos and US dollars, as has been demanded by the situation.Continuing with the countercyclical monetary policy stance, the Board of Directors unanimously decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, placing it at 3.25 %.",
        "This seeks to contribute to cash flows and lays the grounds for the return to a healthy path of expansion of the economy once the health emergency is over.This decision opportunely joins the measures adopted by the National Government to provide support to credits aimed at different groups of corporations and independent workers who seek funding amidst the current highly uncertain environment.The members of the Board anticipate that the recovery of economic growth is to start in the second half of this year.",
        "Also, they consider that the measures taken and those that may be deemed necessary in the future will ensure the proper operation of the payments system in the economy.",
        "At its meeting on 31 July, the Board of Directors of the Central Bank (BDBR) assessed the latest figures available on the national and global economic activity.",
        "Outlined below are the main elements of the monetary policy discussion.The Board considers that the economic activity indicators together with the extension of the measures for preventative isolation and the restrictions imposed on the operation of several sub-sectors indicate that there would be a significant contraction of output during the second quarter of 2020.Despite the better performance of some high-frequency indicators starting in May, both household and corporate income have been severely affected, and a significant amount of spare production capacity continues to be observed.",
        "Added to this, there is a lower external demand forecast for all of 2020.",
        "Given the high degree of uncertainty, the members of the Board highlighted that it is difficult to determine the amount of spare capacity.Additionally, the Board Members expressed their concern regarding the marked deterioration of the labor market.",
        "In June, labor market indicators exhibited results similar to those of the previous month, with unemployment figures at historical levels.",
        "The Board anticipates a gradual recovery of employment as the economic activity recovers.The members of the Board discussed the inflation figure in June (2.19%, below the target), and, particularly, inflation excluding food and regulated items, which reduced to 1.6%.",
        "They also referred to the continued decline of inflation expectations, below the 3.0% target, even over one-year and longer horizons.As for the external front, the BDBR highlighted the improvement of financial conditions supported by the comprehensive response by central banks, which has been reflected by lower sovereign risk premia, lower volatility, and greater liquidity in global and local money markets, public debt, and foreign exchange markets.",
        "Similarly, oil prices and workers' remittances have exhibited a recovery trend.",
        "In this environment, there has been a correction of the strong depreciation of the peso that took place at the onset of the pandemic.In this context, the members of the of the Board considered that monetary policy should have a more expansionary stance in order to support the recovery of economic activity and lead inflation to its target within the policy horizon; therefore, they reduced the benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25%.",
        "At its meeting on 25 September, the Board of Directors ofBanco de la República(the Central Bank of Colombia) assessed the latest figures available on the domestic and global economic activity.",
        "The monetary policy discussion focused on the following aspects.Inflation in August remained below target: 1.88% vs 3.0%.",
        "On the other hand, inflation expectations suggest that the economic agents’ perception to one and two years reiterates this difference.",
        "Indeed, surveys place one-year expectations at 2.75%, while two-year expectations embedded in inflation-indexed bonds are at 2.05%.The economy faces a sharp contraction that the technical staff of the Central Bank estimates between -6.0% and -10% for 2020.While July data reflect a slight decline in national unemployment (19.8%), the labor market and households´ disposable income continue to suggest a situation of marked deterioration, especially of formal labor.Most interest rates have fallen since the beginning of the crisis reflecting significantly the reduction of the monetary policy rate in a context that also exhibits increases in credit volumes to both households and businesses.The international outlook suggests that major central banks will continue to pursue a broadly expansionary monetary policy, and that the high supply of global liquidity and credit will persist for several months.",
        "On the side of demand, while the dynamics of the current account deficit continue to reflect lower funding needsvis-à-visthe period preceding the crisis, public borrowing needs have increased significantly.Uncertainty on several fronts, both domestic and external, remains high.",
        "Regarding possible risk factors, some Board Members highlighted their concerns, including:The possibility that the epidemiological dynamics—which have been favorable in recent weeks—may be reversed, as has been observed in some countries, thus forcing a new contractionary cycle.The possibility that the increase in public debt required to face a prolongation of the crisis will make it more difficult to transmit monetary policy to longer-term interest rates.The Board considered the risk balance and, with a 4-3 vote, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%.",
        "Three members of the Board voted to keep the rate unaltered.The main elements supporting the vote to reduce the rate considered providing additional stimulus by using the space provided by the low level of inflation recorded, and the fact that inflation expectations stand below 3.0%.",
        "Those who voted to keep the rate at 2.0% argued that the risks faced could be boosted by a move towards a more expansive policy stance.",
        "The Board of Directors reviewed the latest available information on economic activity, inflation, and international conditions in their November 27 session.",
        "The monetary policy discussion took the following aspects into account:The Board concluded that the results of economic activity were in line with the expected forecast and path of recovery.",
        "The data on economic growth for the third quarter have confirmed the sharp contraction of the economy in 2020 and the recovery of the majority of the productive sectors and demand components from the previous quarter.",
        "The latest high frequency indicators – EMI, energy demand, home sales, and consumer and business confidence – confirm this trend.The Board members noted that inflation expectations for the end of 2021 are anchored around 3%.",
        "Total inflation stood at 1.75% and core inflation excluding food and regulated items was at 1.55%.",
        "The inflation expectations that are drawn from the public debt papers for maturities of 2 and 3 years are 2.32% and 2.66% respectively.Board members expressed concern about the labor market situation.",
        "Although the data as of September have confirmed a gradual recovery in employment, job creation is concentrated in the informal/non-wage segment, and the unemployment rate remains very high.",
        "This reflects the structural rigidities of the Colombian labor market and calls for prudence in setting the minimum wage.They also emphasized the effective transmission of the policy rate to both lending and borrowing rates.",
        "The balances in the loan portfolios have grown significantly, especially in the housing and commercial sectors.Last of all, the Board members pointed out that leeway in international financial conditions prevails.",
        "Recent announcements by the central banks of the major advanced economies suggest that high liquidity and low international interest rates will remain on the policy horizon.",
        "There have been significant reductions in risk premiums and a recovery in capital flows in emerging economies.In this context, and taking the risk balance into account, all the board members judged that the current benchmark of 1.75% will maintain a monetary policy that supports the recovery of the Colombian economy.",
        "They considered it prudent to hold to this position while waiting for new information about the shocks and the variables that could affect the policy reaction.",
        "DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to keep theBanco de la Republica's benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "The ordinary meeting of the Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicatook place on 27 March 2020 in Bogotá In attendance were the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, Alberto Carrasquilla Barrera; the Governor of the Central Bank, Juan José Echavarría Soto; and Board Members Gerardo Hernández Correa, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Carolina Soto Losada, Roberto Steiner Sampedro, and Arturo José Galindo Andrade.The main monetary policy discussions considered by the Board are summarized as follows AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed that:This is an extraordinary and unprecedented situation of alteration of economic conditions whose analysis requires additional elements to those usually considered for monetary policy design.At the time the crisis broke out, economic activity in Colombia was more dynamic than in other countries, the output gap was closing, inflation was above the target, and inflation expectations were reasonably well anchored.In addition to the coronavirus shock, which directly affects the domestic economic activity and contracts international trade, our country is being severely affected by the collapse in the price of oil.The members of the Board stressed the importance of complementing the measures of liquidity provision already adopted with measures to help alleviate the financial burden of households and enterprises, both for new credit and for part of the outstanding balance.",
        "This seeks to lay the groundwork so that the economy may return to a healthy path of expansion once the health emergency is over.The Board of Directors unanimously decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, placing it at 3.75%.This decision accompanies the measures that the Central Bank has been taking on a priority basis several weeks ago to ensure wide and timely provision of liquidity in both pesos and US dollars, as required under current conditions.The Board will continue to monitor the situation permanently and will make the decisions necessary to ensure the proper operation of the economy DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to reduceBanco de la República'sbenchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, placing it at 3.75%.",

        "Both employment and household and corporate income have been severely affected, and despite their foreseeable recovery starting in May, there will continue to be a significant amount of spare production capacity.The Board Members highlighted the fact that inflation reduced from 3.86% in March to 3.5% in April, when the average of core inflation indicators stood at 2.9%.",
        "They also referred to the continued decline of inflation expectations in line with the 3.0% inflation target, consistent with a weak aggregate demand.They underscored that the financial markets have stabilized in recent weeks, and that financing conditions have improved.",
        "Particularly, the peso has appreciated, country risk has declined, and, as in a number of other emerging markets, access to external financing has improved.",
        "Among other factors, the measures adopted by the Central Bank, the National Government, and the recent recovery in the price of oil have also contributed to these results.In this context, the members of the Board considered that the monetary policy stance could provide an additional boost to economic activity without compromising the inflation target, the financing of the current account deficit, and the macroeconomic balance.The majority of the Board considered that the additional stimulus should be half a percentage point.",
        "Given the proximity to a zero real interest rate, a minority suggested a more gradual adjustment in order to give continuity to the support provided by monetary policy to the significant recovery of financial stability and to facilitate additional movements as may be required in the future.The Board will continue to follow up on the indicators of economic activity, financial markets, inflation, and inflation expectations, and will take additional measures as may be appropriate given the evolution of the risk balance      DECISIONThe Board of Directors ofBanco de la República, by majority, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 2.75%.",
        "After considering the most recent information available on economic activity, inflation, and international conditions, Banco de la República's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on December 18 held the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "Five board members voted in favor of leaving the rate unchanged, while two voted for a 25 bp reduction.The policy discussion centered on the following factors:The directors highlighted that inflation in November (1.49%) was below levels expected by analysts and economic authorities.",
        "They also emphasized that expected inflation remains reasonably well-anchored on the medium-term forecast horizon (2.7% for 2021 and 3.0% for 2022); that economic recovery is progressing at a favorable pace despite ongoing risks related primarily to the -19 pandemic and its fiscal fallout; that monetary policy transmission has been adequate over the course of the year; and that external financial conditions continue to be favorable in terms of financing the Colombian economy.For the majority, the main arguments for holding the current expansionary monetary policy stance centered on the need to focus on medium-term measures of expected inflation and its deviation from the target.",
        "They noted that despite low measures of inflation, the recent decline and the prospect of a further reduction in the short term would begin to reverse in the second quarter of 2021.",
        "Given medium-term inflation expectations that remain close to the target and information related to economic activity that points to a rapid recovery, they considered a deepening of the current expansionary policy stance unnecessary.",
        "Those in the majority placed value on the potential for frequent changes to the benchmark interest rate, possibly in opposite directions, to signal instability to the market.The minority argued in favor of a 25 bp reduction in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They emphasized that recent data has shown surprisingly low inflation, allowing for the expectation of a lower inflation trajectory on the policy horizon.",
        "Though it has not yet happened, if such expectations were adopted by the market it would lead to a less expansionary real policy interest rate than currently exists.",
        "This group argued that it would be reasonable to suggest that this context of lower inflation is the result of a more negative output gap than previously considered.",
        "As a consequence, they suggested that there would be space for a reduction in the benchmark interest rate, and that this would contribute more to tightening the inflation and output gaps.",
        "They also mentioned that the potential risks to the Bank's capacity to reduce its interest rate slightly further have fallen, a factor that was referenced by all of the directors in relation to a reduction in external vulnerabilities.Finally, the BDBR agreed to return to its regular decision-making structure for monetary policy meetings, which had been modified due the pandemic.Monetary Policy DecisionThe BDBR decided by majority to hold the Banco de la República's benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.",
        "At its meeting on 31 August, the Board of Directors ofBanco de la República(the Central Bank of Colombia) assessed the latest figures available on the domestic and global economic activity.",
        "The monetary policy discussion focused on the following aspects:In the second quarter of the year, the economy contracted 15.5% in annual terms, a slowdown caused by the decline in domestic demand.",
        "Despite the contraction of the country’s major trading partners, net external demand contributed positively to growth, since the fall in exports was lower than the contraction of imports.While data to July reiterate the deterioration of the labor market, a moderate recovery was recorded in that monthvis-à-visthe previous month.",
        "In any case, there is still spare productive capacity.In July, consumer inflation continued to decline (1.97%), with food prices standing out, while inflation excluding food and regulated items stopped falling.",
        "Expectations from analyst surveys place inflation at 2.87% at the end of 2021, while expectations embedded in financial instruments are at 1.56% for August 2022.The reduction in the benchmark interest rate continues to be transmitted to the different interest rates.",
        "The largest reductions have taken place in interbank interest rates, fixed-term deposits, and in commercial credit rates.",
        "Smaller reductions have occurred in consumer interest rates while mortgage rates have remained stable.",
        "This behavior of interest rates has taken place in a context in which the portfolio has continued to slow down, particularly for consumer credit.The most recent growth figures from major trading partners confirm an unprecedented contraction of external demand.",
        "These prospects, together with trade tensions between the US and China in the context of very low inflationary pressures, have determined that major central banks continue to pursue a broadly expansionary monetary policy.",
        "Thus, international financial conditions for Colombia continue to improve, while the current account deficit continues to decline.Under these conditions, the Board of Directors of the Central Bank considered that the risk balance suggests it is appropriate to provide an additional boost to the economy and unanimously reduced the benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.0%.",
        "The Board highlighted that the impact of monetary policy will be greater inasmuch as the conditions of the pandemic allow to continue reopening the different economic sectors gradually.",
        "The Central Bank's Board of Directors (BDBR) considered recent information related to economic activity and inflation, as well as the technical staff's revised forecasts.",
        "It noted a slight improvement in growth projections for 2020, though still in the context of significant economic contraction.",
        "The BDBR viewed the flexibilization of lockdown measures, fiscal support for homes and businesses, and low interest rates and ample liquidity provided by the Bank all as factors that contributed at the margin to improved economic expectations.The directors referenced the fact that inflation expectations based on survey results for the end of 2021 had stabilized at 2.8%.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation expectations at two years based on public sector debt rose to 2.52%, nearing levels derived from the survey results.While Colombia's national unemployment rate is expected to fall in the fourth quarter of 2020 and finish the year between 15.1% and 16.9%, it continues to be a factor of significant concern for the board, in particular given high levels of urban unemployment and among certain sectors of the population, including young people and women.The directors emphasized the fact that reductions in the policy rate have been reflected significantly in interest rates within the financial system.",
        "They noted that credit agency Standard & Poor's had maintained its sovereign risk rating for the country, giving the national government time to consolidate its fiscal adjustment efforts.The BDBR's international outlook continued to be one in which the world's major central banks maintain broadly expansive monetary policy and ensure elevated levels of liquidity.",
        "The directors reiterated their view that the current account deficit continues to reflect Colombia's reduced financing needs and emphasized the International Monetary Fund's decision to expand its flexible credit line for the country, strengthening the availability of external liquidity amid a high degree of uncertainty in the global economy.The directors expressed their concern over an upsurge in -19 cases in numerous countries, most notably in Europe, and suggested that recent pandemic dynamics had added an additional degree of uncertainty to economic policy in general and monetary policy in particular.In considering the balance of risks, the BDBR unanimously decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.The board emphasized that future decisions will depend on the evolution of macroeconomic variables and of the risk factors mentioned above."

        "Additionally, a slight acceleration of GDP for the country's trading partners is estimated for 2019.",
        "Thus, the Colombian economy would receive an additional boost next year generated by a stronger external demand.The prices of oil and other raw materials are estimated to reach higher levels than those observed in 2017.",
        "This would continue driving the recovery in the country's terms of trade and the positive effects on national income.The most recent information on capital flows to emerging economies and the behavior of risk premia suggest that external financing would not exhibit significant changes in the rest of the year.",
        "However, in recent months, the expectations of a less expansionary monetary policy in developed economies has increased; consequently, it is estimated that external financing conditions for 2018 will be less generous than in previous years.",
        "This Report assumes four rate increases by the FED during 2018.Forecasts suggest that the country's external deficit should continue correcting in the remainder of the year as a result of a better dynamics of exports of goods and the good performance of current transfers.",
        "Thus, a current account deficit close to 3.1% of GDP is estimated in 2018.The Colombian economy grew 1.8% in 2017, which implies a slight deceleration vis-à-vis the figure for 2016 (2.0%).",
        "The international financing conditions, the prices of commodities, and the demand for trading partners are expected to be favorable to the expansion of Colombia's GDP in 2018.",
        "Additionally, domestic factors such as the decline in inflation, an expansive interest rate, and a labor market without many variations would strengthen the process of convergence toward the growth potential.",
        "Therefore, for 2018, the technical staff maintained its growth projection unaltered at 2.7%.In terms of inflation, the results in the first two months of 2018 have been more favorable than expected by the technical staff and the market.",
        "Particularly, in February, the annual inflation rate stood at 3.37%, lower than the figure observed in December 2017 (4.09%).",
        "This behavior was explained mainly by the dissipation of the effects of the increase in VAT a year ago and a higher-than-expected decline in food prices.The average of core inflation indicators continued its downward trend, standing at 3.96%.",
        "Inflation expectations to December 2018 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts posted at 3.35%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to one year stand between 3.42% and 3.67%, except for the estimation of the FBEI curve, which stands at 4.32%.In all, for 2018, inflation is expected to continue its process of convergence to the target, and economic growth is expected to recover the path towards its potential.",
        "The monetary policy actions carried out so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to its target and maintain a favorable path for GDP growth.",
        "However, uncertainty about the external and internal conditions remains high, which could affect the dynamics of prices and economic activity  AND OPTIONSThe Board Members highlighted the positive results of inflation in the first two months of the year, which has led headline inflation and the average of core inflation to post at 3.37% and 3.96%, respectively.",
        "Food and the tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items were the groups that contributed the most to the fall, added to the fading effects of tax increases at the beginning of 2017.",
        "However, some of the most indexed groups, namely education and health, as well as labor-intensive groups, exhibited increases well-above the target so far this year.",
        "These results of inflation for the two-month period have been accompanied by a reduction of inflation expectations for the end of 2018 arising from the surveys to financial analysts.The data available so far this year suggest that the economy has continued to grow slowly, albeit faster than in 2017.",
        "The technical staff estimates the growth figure for the end of the year at 2.7%.",
        "Factors such as the recovery in external demand, better terms of trade, the effects of the policy of low interest rates followed by the Board, and investment in works should contribute to the estimated growth figure for 2018.The members of the Board also emphasized that, continuing with the orderly adjustment of the economy, the current account deficit reached 3.3% of GDP in 2017, and is estimated at 3.1% of GDP for 2018.The Board agreed that the current benchmark interest rate (4.5%) is slightly expansionary.The analysis of the Board focused on: (i) the possible effect of the persistence in some items on the end-of-year inflation, and a less favorable behavior in food inflation; (ii) the slow dynamics of economic activity, the widening of the output gap, and uncertainty about its pace of recovery.The majority of the Board Members voted in favor of maintaining the benchmark interest rate unaltered.",
        "They supported their decision on the risks that persistence of inflation of some goods and services poses to the inflation forecasts, which remain well-above the target, despite the decline that took place in the first quarter.",
        "Also, on the dependence of inflation forecasts on the expected behavior of food prices at the end of the year.This group of Board Members also noted that they observe an improvement in the confidence indicators and in several agents' expectations, despite the fact that economic activity started the year with a weak dynamics.",
        "They stressed that the growth figure of the economy expected for 2018 is below its potential.",

        "This would continue driving the recovery in the country's terms of trade and the positive effects on national income.This report assumes three additional increases in the FED's benchmark interest rate during 2018; consequently, the rate would move within the range of 2.25% to 2.50% at the end of the year.",
        "In addition, for 2019, two more increases versus the estimates for 2018 are expected.",
        "In this scenario, this fact would not have significant negative impacts on the dynamics of the global economy.",
        "In fact, the most recent information on capital flows to emerging economies and the behavior of risk premia suggest that external financing would not exhibit significant changes in the rest of the year.Forecasts suggest that the country's external deficit as a share of GDP should continue correcting in 2018 as a result of a better dynamics of exports of goods and the good performance of current transfers.",
        "Thus, the current account deficit in 2018 is estimated close to 3.1% of GDP.The technical staff considers that the Colombian economy would grow 2.7% in 2018 in the baseline scenario.",
        "International financing conditions, prices of commodities, and demand from trading partners are expected to be favorable to the expansion of Colombia's GDP in 2018.",
        "Additionally, internal factors such as the decline in inflation, an expansive interest rate, and a labor market without many variations would strengthen the process of convergence towards the growth potential.",
        "It is important to note that the risk balance is biased upwards by the effects that a more favorable behavior of the price of oil would have on the Colombian economy compared to the baseline scenario.",
        "In terms of inflation, the results in the first quarter have proved to be more favorable than expected by the technical staff and by the market.",
        "Particularly, in March, headline inflation stood at 3.14%, a figure significantly lower than the one observed in December 2017 (4.09%).",
        "The declines were observed in the majority of sub-baskets except for food inflation, which exhibited a slight increase.",
        "The preliminary estimate of the technical staff for GDP growth in 2019 is 3.7%.The average of core inflation indicators continued its downward trend, reaching 3.64%.",
        "Inflation expectations to December 2018 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts posted at 3.27%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to one year stand between 2.87% and 3.30%.In summary, for 2018, inflation is expected to continue converging to the target, and economic growth is expected to show a greater dynamism for 2018 and 2019.",
        "The monetary policy actions carried out so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for the expansion of the GDP.",
        "However, uncertainty about the external and internal conditions and on the volatility of oil prices remains high, all of which could affect the dynamics of prices and economic activity AND OPTIONSThe Board Members emphasized the positive behavior of inflation and highlighted that in recent months there have been falls, both in headline inflation, as in the various core inflation indicators.",
        "This decline has been higher than expected by the Central Bank's technical staff and by the market.",
        "In this line, inflation expectations and inflation forecasts for the policy horizon have also reduced in recent months.The members of the Board argued that the reduction of the nominal exchange rate reinforces the reduction of inflation projections.",
        "However, they noted that the future behavior of this variable is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, since it depends on highly volatile factors such as the prices of commodities and capital flows.Some Board Members noted that improvement trends are consolidating in different indicators of real activity.",
        "They emphasized the good performance of exports of goods and services and the recovery in the dynamics of various sectors of the economy, as is the case of trade and tourism.",
        "Nevertheless, other sectors that are considered important due to their share in GDP as well as to their economic linkages and participation in the demand for labor, have not yet exhibited strong signals of recovery.",
        "This is the case of the construction sector.Some of the members of the Board stressed that the decline in inflation and inflation expectations, in the absence of policy decisions, increases the real interest rate, which reinforces the desirability of reducing the benchmark intervention rate to maintain the moderately expansionary monetary policy stance.Some Board Members noted that, despite the recovery of economic activity, the projected growth is below potential, for which spare capacity would continue increasing this year.",
        "This is another factor that indicates that the intervention rate should be reduced DECISIONThe Board of Directors ofBanco de la Repúblicaat today’s meeting decided unanimously to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 4.25 %.Bogotá,",

        "For 2019, growth of trading partners is expected to be similar to the forecast for 2018.",
        "Thus, the Colombian economy would receive an additional boost from a stronger external demand.The prices of oil and other raw materials are estimated to reach higher levels than those observed in 2017.",
        "In particular, this report revised upwards the forecast of the average price of oil, to USD 69 per barrel for 2018.",
        "This would continue driving the recovery in the country's terms of trade and the positive effects on national income.Compared to the previous report, the increase in the risk perception for emerging economies has been an important change in the external context.",
        "However, this has not yet affected capital flows towards most of these economies.Forecasts suggest that the country's external deficit as a share of GDP should continue correcting in 2018 as a result of a better dynamics of exports of goods and the good performance of current transfers.",

        "Additionally, internal factors such as the decline in inflation, an expansive interest rate, and a labor market without many variations would strengthen the process of convergence towards the growth potential.In terms of inflation, results in the last three months of the year show that the variation in prices has remained stable, after a significant decline the first two months of the year.",
        "Particularly, in May, annual inflation stood at 3.16%, a figure significantly lower than the one observed in December 2017 (4.09%).",
        "The declines were concentrated in the sub-groups of tradables (excluding food and regulated items) and, to a lesser extent, in non-tradable inflation (excluding food and regulated items) and meals outside the home.In May, the average of the four core inflation indicators exhibited a slight increase to 3.43%, after four months of continuous declines.",

        "However, uncertainty about the external and internal conditions and on the volatility of oil prices remains high, all of which could affect the dynamics of prices and economic activity AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board noted the reduction in the inflation rate that has been taking place throughout 2018 as positive, although it has slowed down its downward trend in recent months.",
        "However, they highlighted that there are risks for the rest of the year associated with potential increases in food prices, high oil prices and their effects on the price of gasoline, and the new depreciation trend of the peso.Regarding economic activity, they noted that the reactivation is still in progress, although it is still weak and the output gap continues to widen.",
        "This reactivation is reflected, particularly, on economic growth in the first quarter and, according to some data (still incomplete), in the second.",
        "However, they expressed doubts about the sustainability of some components of demand, particularly government consumption.",
        "Nevertheless, they agreed that the data for the second quarter suggests that economic activity has been better than the forecast for the baseline scenario by the Central Bank’s technical staff.For some members of the Board, this would indicate that growth could come closer to 3.0% during the current year.",
        "The greatest weakness continues to take place in the construction sector.As for the external sector, the Board Members highlighted the persistent dynamics of exports other than oil and mining, particularly manufacturing.",
        "At the same time, they showed concern about the uncertainty in international financial markets, albeit noting that, until now, its effect on the country's capital flows and risk premia has been quite moderate.",
        "However, they agreed that these uncertainties should be taken into account in the design of monetary policy.",
        "They also discussed the extent to which the trends in international markets, together with the Colombian economy, could result in increases of the long-term real interest rate, although with differences of opinion on the magnitude of this increase.Several Board Members also emphasized that the reversal of the revaluation trend from previous months has been good, since it could have endangered the buoyancy of exports other than oil and mining.In this context, in the opinion of the Board Members, the balance of risks arising from the somewhat less favorable trends in inflation, the ongoing recovery of economic activity, and the uncertainties in the international markets indicates the need to maintain the monetary policy stance on this occasion DECISIONThe Board of Directors ofBanco de la República, at today’s meeting, unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%.Bogotá,",

        "For 2019, an expansion of the country's trading partners similar to the one projected for 2018 is estimated.",
        "This suggests that the recovery in external demand for Colombia would be stabilizing around the growth figure observed in 2017.The prices of oil and other raw materials were revised upwards, which implies slightly more favorable terms of trade than those considered in the previous quarter and which stimulate national income.",
        "Particularly, this report increased the forecast of the average price of oil, which stood at USD 74.5 per barrel for 2018.",
        "For 2019, this figure was also was revised upwards.",
        "An average price of USD 73 per barrel is expected.The expectations of a more rapid normalization of monetary policy in the United States, lower global growth prospects and political uncertainty in Europe have exacerbated the volatility in the financial markets in the last month.",
        "A greater risk perception towards emerging economies has affected the risk premia for the region, although this behavior has moderated in recent months.Forecasts suggest that the external deficit as a share of the country's GDP would have finished adjusting and would remain stablevis-à-visthe previous year.",
        "Thus, the current account deficit is estimated at 3.4% of GDP in 2018 and somewhat similar in 2019.The technical staff slightly reduced the growth estimate for the Colombian economy, which would expand at a 2.6% rate in 2018 in the baseline scenario, considering the persisting uncertainty associated with the execution of investment in works that may affect GDP dynamics.",
        "However, the conditions of international financing and the prices of commodities remain favorable to the expansion of output.For 2019, GDP growth is expected to continue recovering, although uncertainty in this regard is high, particularly concerning the behavior of consumer confidence, works, and external conditions.",
        "Thus, for 2019, GDP growth is projected at 3.5% within a range between 2.5% and 4.0%.In line with the technical staff's and the market's expectations, inflation increased in September, standing at 3.23% on a yearly basis.",
        "This acceleration is explained by the behavior of food, particularly perishable goods.",
        "In contrast, the other groups pressured the annual inflation downwards.",
        "In September, the average of the four core inflation indicators showed a slight decline compared with the previous month, reaching 3.28%.Inflation expectations to December 2018 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts posted at 3.28%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to one year stand between 3.3% and 3.5%.In all, a slight increase in inflation due to supply factors is expected for the end of 2018, within a more dynamic economic growth environment than in the previous year, and which would continue in 2019.",

        "According to the latest records available, inflation remains slightly above the target.",
        "Core inflation indicators remain, on average, about 3.0%, with a downward trend.",
        "The Board mentioned that the level of inflation of regulated items remains high.They also highlighted the increased uncertainty and the risk perception arising from the external context, which has begun to have an impact on Colombia, although moderate in the TES market.",
        "In this scenario, it is essential for the monetary authority to continue monitoring the external conditions and the domestic effects of likely shocks.From the perspective of domestic demand, there was consensus in that uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery increased.",
        "Part of this uncertainty is linked to the low dynamics of commercial loans, which reflects a slow recovery of investment.",
        "In the opposite direction, the sales and industry indicators are positive.In this context of a greater international uncertainty albeit with a weaker domestic demand and stable inflation, although slightly above the target, the members of the Board deemed prudent to maintain the current level of the benchmark interest rate.Some Board Members mentioned that the recent devaluation of the Colombian peso has deviated from other emerging markets.",
        "Others argued that the recent adjustment responds to a correction of the revaluation observed in the first half of the year.Another issue pointed out by some members of the group was the recent decline in the Consumer Confidence Index, which could add uncertainty to the process of economic recovery     DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.",

        "This would be explained, to a large extent, by a higher basis of comparison for the same period of 2016 and to the adverse effect of the air transport strike.",
        "However, the estimate for the fourth quarter continues to be higher than observed in the first half of the year, suggesting that the recovery of the economy is taking place, albeit at a slow pace.With this, the technical staff at the Central Bank forecasts that yearly GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 would post between 1.3% and 2.3%, with 1.8% as the most likely figure.",
        "Considering this, the forecast for GDP growth remains at 1.6% for 2017, but the forecast range was reduced somewhat (moving from 1.3% and 1.9% to 1.4% and 1.8%).The current account deficit would have posted for the whole year at 3.5% of GDP (within a range between 3.3% and 3.7% of GDP).In real terms, the figures of total credit to December reflect a portfolio that would be recovering slowly due to the behavior of commercial credit (including /E, external direct, and bonds).",
        "The households’ portfolio is still slowing down, but still records high real rates of increase.For this year, regarding the external context, the forecast for the country's trading partners was revised upwards, supported by the better performance of the advanced economies and the signs of recovery in some emerging countries.",
        "The latter were driven by the improved performance of China and better terms of trade.For 2018, GDP growth is projected between 1.7% and 3.7%, with 2.7% as the most likely figure.",
        "This forecast provides for an acceleration of growth that is consistent with a more favorable outlook for the terms of trade and external demand than observed in 2017.",
        "The best international prices of raw materials would also favor the expansion of mining investment, which would contribute positively to a growth in domestic demand.The current account deficit for 2018 would stand between 2.8% and 3.8% of GDP, with 3.3% in the baseline scenario.",
        "This projection, which also incorporates the best scenario of commodity prices and growth of the major trading partners, suggests an additional adjustment of the trade balance.",
        "However, it also considers an increase in the cost of external financing as a result of a less expansionary monetary policy stance in the developed economies.In Colombia, at the end of 2017, inflation stood at 4.09%, 109 bp above the inflation target.",
        "However, annual inflation in December reducedvis-à-visthe figure for November (4.12%).",
        "The decline in inflation during the month and versus the previous year can be explained by the contraction in all major components of the food group.",
        "On the other hand, core inflation, measured as the average of the four indicators monitored by the Central Bank (4.66%), rose for the second month in a row, after contracting without interruption since August 2016.The different measures of inflation expectations remain above the target (3.0%).",
        "The path of analysts’ expectations was reduced in the January survey, and inflation expectations for December 2018 are at 3.83%.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds rose slightly in January and are currently around 3.5%.In all, inflation is expected to continue lowering in the first quarter of the year, partly as a result of the reversal of the transitory shocks that have diverted it from its target.",
        "This takes place in an environment of a recovering economic activity, but still with excess of installed capacity.",
        "Monetary policy actions undertaken so far, which consider these effects, should strengthen convergence of inflation to its target  AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed that, with the data observed, the economic recovery has not yet been clearly evidenced.",
        "However, agents' expectations have begun to improve moderately.",
        "Particularly, they highlighted the good performance of exports, which contributed to a better outcome in the current account deficit in 2017.On the other hand, they mentioned that inflation forecasts for 2018 continue to converge towards the 3.0% target, although such path is now higher than in the last meeting and has increased the uncertainty about the behavior of several of its components.Four Board Members voted to reduce the benchmark interest rate.",
        "In their opinion, the figures of economic activity were still very weak, with no evidence of recovery.",
        "To that extent, and given that inflation projections continue to show convergence to the 3.0% target in 2018, a reduction was suitable in order to provide a stimulus that can be significant to the economy, instead of waiting.",
        "However, they considered that the space for such reduction was not very wide due to the risks that still persist of a slower convergence of inflation to the target, and therefore decided on a 25 bp reduction.The remaining Board Members expressed that the risks of a slower convergence of inflation to its target have increased since the last meeting.",
        "The adjustment of the minimum wage for this year, the widespread increase in the different components of inflation at the end of the year, and the persistence of inflation in some groups of goods and services were some of the factors mentioned as a source of greater risk.",

        "For 2018, an average price of US $72 per barrel (Brent) is projected, and of US $66.5 per barrel for 2019.As expected, the Fed increased its reference rate by 25 basis points at its December meeting.In this environment, an increase in risk premia and in the country's exchange rate has been observed, while a smaller increase in international interest rates is expected compared with the forecasts in the previous report.The new estimates suggest that the adjustment of the external imbalance would have stopped in 2018, and that the current account deficit would widen somewhat in 2019.",
        "A current account deficit of 3.6% of GDP is expected in 2018, and a slightly higher one for 2019.In the third quarter, domestic demand turned out better than expected, mainly by investment in construction.",
        "Despite this, the technical staff maintained the growth forecast for 2018 at 2.6%.",
        "This estimate assumes that part of the positive impact observed in public consumption at the beginning of the year fades in the fourth quarter.",
        "Also, that the acceleration in the construction of buildings would have been partly transitory, inasmuch as some indicators related to the performance of the sector remains weak.Observed inflation has been somewhat lower than expected, due mainly to a more favorable performance of prices of food and of tradable goods, and in spite of upward pressures on the group of regulated items.",
        "Specifically, in November, annual inflation stood at 3.27%, a figure slightly lower than in the previous month.",

        "Similarly, both the projections of the Central Bank's technical staff for 2019 and analysts’ expectations to one and two years stand close to the target.Some members of the Board noted that there is a significant likelihood of shocks that may affect prices in the future.",
        "Specifically, they referred to the rising effect on the price level by the following events: (i) the devaluation of the exchange rate produced by non-monetary reasons; (ii) the increase in relative prices of public utilities; and (iii) the increase in the minimum wage above the growth level of labor productivity.",
        "Although there are various points of view on the intensity of these shocks and their effect on prices, the Board Members agreed that policy responses must consider the effects of the shocks on the anchoring of inflation expectations to the target Growth and Domestic DemandThe members of the Board believe that output growth will increase in 2019.",
        "However, there is no consensus on the strength of this increase, and, therefore on the evolution of the output gap.",
        "The main differences focus on the expected behavior of domestic demand in the coming quarters.Some Board Members noted that recent data on consumer confidence as well as the difficult environment for external financing do not allow for optimism about the growth of domestic demand in the near future.In the opposite direction, other members of the Board highlighted elements that allow to forecast a relatively dynamic performance of domestic demand in the first part of 2019.",
        "Particularly, they pointed out the following aspects: (i) the positive recent outcomes from industry, trade, and imports; (ii) the favorable behavior of the indicators that provide a broader set of information from surveys and asset prices; and (iii) investment incentives introduced by the Financing Act (Ley de Financiamiento).Finally, some members of the Board stated that with the current information there is great uncertainty on this issue, and that they consider that their best estimate is a moderate growth, higher than the one suggested by the survey on consumer confidence, but lower than expected some months ago.As for the expected behavior of exports, the Board Members stated that the most likely scenarios for the international environment do not allow to foresee that neither external demand nor the terms of trade will be a significant source for growth in 2019.",
        "However, these factors may be partially offset by the recent depreciation of the exchange rate External Sector and the Balance of PaymentsThe members of the Board discussed the effects of the external and the domestic situations on the forecast for the balance of payments.",

        "Regarding this last issue, they underscored the importance of maintaining a high proportion of the deficit financed through foreign direct investment.",
        "Also, one Board Member highlighted the importance of the new tax rules (which will govern portfolio investment) to finance the deficit.Also, the Board emphasized the challenges that an international situation characterized by greater global instability and high uncertainty on global growth may have on the Colombian economy Policy StanceBalancing the risks of the aforementioned elements, the members of the Board unanimously agreed to maintain the current monetary policy stance, which they described as slightly expansionary.",

        "This, however, continues to reflect an accelerationvis-à-vis2017.",
        "A very similar expansion of the country’s trading partners to the one anticipated for 2018 is expected in 2019.",
        "This would allow the Colombian economy to receive an additional boost generated by a stronger external demand.The prices of oil and other raw materials were revised upwards, which implies more favorable terms of trade than those considered in the previous quarter, and a stimulus for national income.",
        "Particularly, this report increased the forecast of the average price of oil, which stood at USD $71 per barrel for 2018.",
        "However, this forecast implies a reduction in the price for the rest of the year.",
        "For 2019, an average price of USD $67 per barrel is expected.Although the perception of risk in emerging economies has increased, this has not yet compromised capital flows to most of these economies.This report revised the current account deficit upwards, from 3.1% to 3.2% of GDP in 2018.",
        "This forecast implies a better dynamics of exports of goods and a good performance of current transfers.The technical staff maintains the forecast for GDP growth at 2.7% for 2018. International financing conditions, prices of commodities, and demand from trading partners are expected to be favorable to the expansion of Colombia's GDP in 2018.",
        "Additionally, internal factors such as the decline in inflation, an expansive interest rate, and a labor market without many variations would strengthen the process of convergence towards the growth potential.",
        "However, there are risks that may affect the dynamics of GDP, such as the execution of investment on works, the price of oil, and the performance of the sector of buildings.In terms of inflation, the results in the last four months show that the variation in prices has remained relatively stable after a major fall in the first two months of the year.",
        "Particularly, in June, the annual inflation rate stood at 3.20%, a figure somewhat higher than in March (3.14%).In June, the average of core inflation indicators exhibited a slight descent, standing at 3.33%.",
        "Inflation expectations to December 2018 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts posted at 3.52%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to a year stand between 3.0% and 3.4%.In all, inflation is expected to continue its process of convergence to the target, and economic growth is expected to exhibit a better dynamics in 2018 and 2019.",
        "The monetary policy actions carried out so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for the expansion of the GDP.",
        "However, uncertainty about the external and domestic conditions and about the volatility of oil prices remains high, which could affect the dynamics of prices and economic activity AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board continue to see a positive outlook in terms of the performance of headline inflation.",
        "The reading of the latest figure is favorable, particularly when observing the evolution of the different core inflation indicators as well as of inflation related to non-tradable goods and leases.",
        "Yet, the Board emphasized that the technical staff’s projection for the end of the year was affected by the expected increase in food inflation and by inflation of regulated items, the latter due to the upward pressures of the international price of oil.Vis-à-visthe previous meeting, the risk that persists on this front is due to the external context, in which the level of uncertainty is high.",
        "Until now, Colombia has not been negatively impacted, but it is essential to continue monitoring the external conditions and the domestic effects of possible shocks.The Board Members perceive that the performance of economic activity for the remainder of the year will be better than the forecast by the technical staff, and agree that the latest indicators corroborate this hypothesis.",
        "There was general consensus on clear signs of recovery of economic activity, although there is still a negative output gap, which increased between 2017 and 2018, according to the forecast by the technical staff.There were several mentions regarding the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.",
        "Several Board Members emphasized that the commercial loans portfolio does not yet exhibit a strong evidence of recovery.",
        "Others mentioned that the transmission of the reduction in the benchmark interest rate has not yet ended, therefore the assessment of the evolution of all credit variables should continue.The possible effects of narrower international financial conditions on the long-term real interest rate and on the assessment of the monetary policy stance were also discussed.Within this context, despite a negative output gap, with stable inflation (albeit above the target), and a highly uncertain external context, there is an evident economic recovery.",
        "Therefore, the Board Members consider it prudent to maintain the current level of the benchmark interest rate DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%.Bogotá,",

        "This is explained mainly by the performance of consumption and investment in advanced economies.",
        "Also, a slight acceleration is still expected for 2019.However, the macroeconomic imbalances in some emerging economies, together with higher expectations of an increase in the interest rates of developed countries and the consequences of trade disputes, have generated greater uncertainty in the international context.This report revised the forecast for some raw materials upwards, particularly oil for the remainder of 2018 and for 2019.",
        "Thus, the average price per barrel (Brent) is estimated at US $72 for 2018, and at US $68 per barrel for 2019.The forecasts suggest that external deficit as a share of the country’s GDP would continue correcting in 2018, but at a slower pace than observed in previous years.",
        "In this manner, the current account deficit is estimated as close to 3.3% of GDP in 2018, and slightly higher for 2019.The technical staff estimates that the Colombian economy would expand at a rate of 2.7% in 2018 in the baseline scenario, considering that the international financing conditions, the prices of commodities, and the demand from trading partners continue to be favorable to GDP expansion.",
        "Additionally, domestic factors such as lower inflation, an expansive interest rate, and a relatively stable labor market would enhance a scenario of recovery in growth.In the last few months, inflation has remained at levels close to the target.",
        "Particularly in August, headline inflation stood at 3.10%, slightly lower than in the previous month.",
        "The decreases in the annual variation in the group of non-tradable and regulated items stands out, although the latter continue at a very high level of annual adjustment.In August, the average of the four core inflation indicators showed a slight decline compared with the previous month, reaching 3.35%.",
        "Inflation expectations to December 2018 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts posted at 3.23%.",
        "Analysts’ expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to a year stand between 3.2% and 3.4%.In all, a slight increase in inflation due to supply factors is expected for the end of 2018, within a more dynamic economic growth environment than in the previous year, and which would continue in 2019.",
        "The monetary policy actions carried out so far should consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target and maintain a favorable path for the expansion of GDP.",
        "Uncertainty about external financing conditions and the performance of some emerging economies remains high AND OPTIONSThe Members of the Board continue to highlight a good outlook in terms of inflation.",
        "The reading of the latest data is positive, particularly observing the evolution of the different core inflation indicators, which have stood around 3.0%.",
        "However, they emphasized that the inflation level of the groups of regulated and non-tradable items remains high, despite a fall in the latter throughout the year.As in the previous meeting, there were several mentions of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.",
        "Several Board Members emphasized that the commercial loan portfolio does not yet exhibit recovery.The members of the Board agreed that the external environment continues to be highly uncertain, and stressed that Colombia has not been negatively impacted and that sovereign risk premia have not recorded significant changes.",
        "In this scenario, it is essential for the monetary authority to continue monitoring the external conditions and the effects of possible shocks on the local economy.The Board noted that, with the information available and from the meetings held with business representatives in several regions of the country, economic activity exhibits symptoms of recovery, although there is still a negative output gap which is expected to widen between 2017 and 2018, according to the forecast of the technical staff.",
        "The current levels of oil prices and greater confidence in the future growth of the economy should contribute to consolidate these dynamics in the remainder of the year and in the next year, although there is uncertainty about the pace of recovery.The Board also discussed the possible effect of less-favorable international financial conditions and the impact that this would have on the future monetary policy stance.In this context of economic recovery, although still with a negative output gap, with stable inflation albeit slightly higher than the target, and a more uncertain external environment, the members of the Board deemed prudent to maintain the current level of the benchmark interest rate  DECISIONThe Board of Directors unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%."

        "On December 16, 2011, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica was held in the city of Bogota.",
        "Present were: Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of the Treasury and Public Credit Jose Dario Uribe, the General Director Full‐time Board members present: Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate and Cesar Vallejo The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made with respect to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting.",
        "Annual consumer inflation in November was 3.96% (0.14% monthly), 6 basis points (bp) lower than in October.",
        "The adjustment of accumulated prices over the course of the year is 3.29%, which is higher than what had been registered during the same period last year (2.51%).",
        "The drop in total inflation during the month was mainly due to the slowdown in the variation of food prices.",
        "The CPI excluding food, in turn, remained at 3.03%.",
        "This was the result of a decline in the annual change in the CPI for regulated items that offset the increase in the CPI for tradables and non‐tradables (excluding food and regulated items).",
        "In the case of the CPI for food the annual change went from 6.6% in October to 6.4% in November as a result of which the accumulated six‐month rising trend has been interrupted.",
        "In terms of annual variations, the declines were concentrated in perishables as they went from 17.6% in October to 14.6% in November.",
        "For the majority of the other subgroups in the basket, there was an upswing in the annual change.",
        "In the case of potatoes and fruit, there have been absolute drops in prices that occurred after a period of significant rises.",
        "This suggests that the recent movements have been associated with the normal supply cycle for these products.",
        "So far, the intense rainfall caused by the Niña phenomenon has not caused an interruption in the supply chain for food except in the case of milk and eggs.",
        "The prices for imported food have registered few rises in the last few months in spite of the depreciation of the peso.",
        "This could be linked to some declines that have been seen in international prices.",
        "The slowdown in the basket for regulated prices (a fall of 48 bp compared to October) was due to a correction in the fees for electricity in Cali after a sharp rise that was registered two months ago.",
        "In the case of the domestic price for gas and the prices for public transportation, there were no significant changes in November, but there was a significant rise in the cost of natural gas.",
        "This was the item that exercised the most upward pressure on that sub‐basket.",
        "The CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated prices, in turn, was at 0.6% (annual variation) compared to 0.4% the previous month.",
        "For several months this group has been showing increases that are related to the depreciation of the exchange rate in the second half of the year.",
        "With respect to the non‐tradables excluding food and regulated prices, the annual change in November was 3.6%.",
        "Rent, which is the main component of this basket, showed a slight upward trend which, nonetheless, does not imply any annual readjustments that are much above 3% yet (3.3% in November).",
        "In spite of the fact that total inflation declined, core inflation continued to rising in November.",
        "The average for the three indicators monitored by the Banco de la Republica was at 3.34%, which is 7 bp more than the month before.",
        "Even if all of the indicators rose, they would still remain within the target range.",
        "Inflation expectations not show significant changes in the last month.",
        "Those expectations obtained through the monthly survey as of December of this year are at 3.6%, which is the same as it was a month ago, and those for 12 months are at 3.4%, which is slightly above the responses in October.",
        "The expectations obtained on the basis of the TES showed a slight dip after the increase registered the previous month.",
        "All of them except for the 10 year expectations stayed between 3.5% and 4.0%.",
        "In November, there was a significant reduction in the annual variation of the PPI (to 6.8% after 7.9% last month).",
        "The slowdown occurred in both the group of imported goods and the one of locally produced and consumed goods Growth The latest indicators of economic activity for the third quarter of 2011 confirmed that the annual growth rate for the economy surged in comparison to what had been seen in the first half of the year.",
        "It also confirmed that the Colombian economy is still being driven mainly by domestic demand.",
        "In the information that was recently published, the most interesting was the data on public works projects for the third quarter.",
        "According to DANE, the indicator rose 22.8% in annual terms.",
        "The largest expansion within the area was in construction work associated with the mining sector.",
        "The census on building shows that there has been an increase of close to 10% annually in area occupied by buildings in the third quarter.",
        "Other quarterly indicators associated with the service sector (hotels, travel agencies) and livestock (animal slaughter) also showed favorable performance in the third quarter.",
        "The strong domestic demand for the period occurred within a framework of relatively low, real interest rates, high availability of loans, and a rise in employment.",
        "Under these conditions, household consumption has continued to show strong performance, especially in relationship to the purchases of durable goods.",
        "Investment has been driven by public works construction projects, by the purchases of machinery and transportation equipment, and by the expansion of housing.",
        "By branches of activity, the sectors that have registered higher rates of growth are construction and mining.",
        "The few indicators available for the fourth quarter of 2011 are showing a little slowdown in the rate of annual growth although their strength is still high.",
        "Sales of vehicles continued to rise per unit in November.",
        "Consumer confidence recovered in November after having dropped in the previous three months.",
        "The level of this indicator can still be considered high (it has been above its average since 2001).",
        "The consumer loan portfolio continues to expand at rates that are close to 25%.",
        "With respect to supply, most of the indicators associated with the industrial sector remain stable (orders, inventory, demand for electricity, etc.).",
        "ANDI also revealed that the growth of industrial production up to October was 6%, a figure that is similar to the one given a month earlier (6.1% for the year up to September).",
        "In October, total exports in dollars came to a value of US$4.713 million and grew 32.6% annually.",
        "This increase is mainly the result of mining exports.",
        "Foreign sales of agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas and flowers) declined 5.3% compared to the same month a year ago.",
        "This performance came from primarily the drop in the quantities of coffee (20% annually) and flowers (15.5% annually) sent.",
        "The rest of the exports excluding commodities registered an annual growth of 8.1% driven mainly by food, beverages and chemical products.",
        "In the labor market, the unemployment rate continued its declining trend.",
        "The monthly figure as of October was 9.0% for the national total and 10.2% for the thirteen main cities.",
        "With respect to the national total, this figure is the lowest for the last decade.",
        "Again, the larger growth of the labor demand (measured as the employment rate) in comparison to the growth of the labor supply (measured by the overall participation rate) explains the drop in the unemployment rate.",
        "The performance described is in line with what is contemplated in the September Inflation Report where there is a range of output growth for the entire year that is between 5% and 6% Financial Variables Total loans in national (NC) and foreign (FC) currency are maintaining high rates of growth.",
        "All of the types of credit including those for both household and business continue to register a growth that is well above the growth of economic activity.",
        "In November, the real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) for consumer, mortgage and commercial loans were at 14.9%, 9.9%, and 8.3% respectively.",
        "These figures are lower than the averages that have been seen since 1998 Foreign Context The measures taken to overcome the European debt crisis after the meeting between the European Central Bank and the leaders of the European Union from December 7 to 9 seem to have been considered insufficient by the markets.",
        "This is what has been demonstrated by the recent increase in the interest on the Italian and Spanish 10‐year bonds and the drop of the euro to US$1.30, its lowest level since January of this year.",
        "As a result, the financial markets are remaining at high levels of volatility.",
        "The new information available suggests that the global economy is deteriorating at a higher rate than expected.",
        "In the euro zone, a very low rate of growth is projected for the last quarter of 2011 and the first one of 2012 with a high risk that it will go into negative territory.",
        "In particular, the marked deterioration of business and consumer expectations just like the lower rate of expansion in the largest economies in the region (Germany and France), causes them to anticipate a mediocre performance in 2012.",
        "Furthermore, the liquidity restrictions of the European banks, in spite of the cut in the benchmark interest rate (from 1.25% to 1%) and the new liquidity easing approved by the European Central Bank, threaten to strangle credit.",
        "Add to this the rigidity of the fiscal adjustment imposed by the new regulations, which limit the structural deficit to 0.5% of the GDP for member countries of the European Union.",
        "This could accentuate the slowdown in economic activity in the short term.",
        "In the United States, the better indicators for economic activity in the last few weeks have mitigated fears of a double recession.",
        "However, the foreign risks associated with Europe or a sharp slowdown in China could limit their rate of growth.",
        "In the emerging economies the data from the latest months show a sharper slowdown than was estimated in the central scenario in the September Inflation Report as a result of domestic and foreign factors.",
        "China and Brazil have begun to implement less restrictive monetary and fiscal policies in order to encourage domestic demand and counteract the effects of more limited foreign growth.",
        "In China, the fall in housing prices has begun to generate concern.",
        "During the last few years, construction has been the primary motor for growth in this economy and a crisis in that sector could cause a sharp slowdown.",
        "In terms of monetary policy, the advanced economies are holding to a lax position and some emerging economies such as Brazil and Thailand have begun to lower their benchmark rates.",
        "For the next few months, analysts expect that more economies will follow suit and help stimulate domestic demand in each country.",
        "The international prices for the main commodities have declined moderately.",
        "Specifically, the international price for petroleum is in the upper part of the range estimated in the last quarterly report.",
        "As a result, the terms of trade remain high and continue to drive national income.",
        "The biggest risk of the central growth forecasts is a disorderly adjustment in Europe.",
        "If this should materialize, the global economy will grow considerably less than expected, the international prices for commodities could fall and global risk aversion will be exacerbated.",
        "This will have an adverse effect on the Colombian economy.",
        "There is a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of a tightening like that and its effects.",
        "The majority of the Board thought it would be advisable to keep the Bank’s benchmark interest rates unaltered based on the balance between the foreign and domestic situations, a balance that is, nonetheless, highly sensitive to the new information available.",
        "The opinion of the Board was that, regarding the foreign front, the following points should be kept in mind: (i) The international financial markets are still showing high levels of volatility as a result of the sovereign debt problems in Europe.",
        "It is probable that the economies in the euro‐zone will shrink in the last quarter of 2011 and in the first half of 2012, though there is high level of uncertainty about the magnitude of the contraction and its effects.",
        "(ii) If a disorderly adjustment should materialize in Europe, the worldwide economy will grow considerably less than expected, the international prices for commodities could fall, and global risk aversion would be exacerbated.",
        "All of this would adversely affect the Colombian economy.",
        "(iii) The United States economy may expand at a moderate rate and it is expected that it will continue to do so for a prolonged period.",
        "(iv) Various emerging economies have shown recent signs of a slowdown.",
        "In the domestic context, the following should be kept in mind: (i) The international prices for commodities remain at high levels and are stimulating the national income of producing countries.",
        "(ii) The most recent information on the performance of economic activity suggests that the growth of the GDP in the third quarter will surpass 6%.",
        "(iii) Commercial lending is growing at a high rate and seems to be surging.",
        "The performance of consumer loans suggests that households have raised their degree of leveraging considerably.",
        "(iv) The indices for new and used housing prices are still at their maximum registers.",
        "(v) The measurements of core inflation continue to rise and the majority are surpassing 3%.",
        "(vi) The information available shows that, as a result of the increases in the benchmark interest rates and the performance of other international and local variables, inflation expectations obtained through the TES stopped rising and even showed a slight drop and, (vii) signs that, even if the Colombian economy remains strong, this momentum could be moderating.",
        "The inflation expectations and forecasts are increasingly dominated by the expectations and predictions concerning the climate, which monetary policy lacks appropriate tools to deal with and, (viii) the probable impact of decisions regarding wages and labor regulations on inflation expectations and workings of the labor market.",
        "One member of the Board expressed as his opinion that the benchmark interest rates should be raised 25 bp based on the following: (i) The sectors in the domestic context of the Colombian economy that were pointed out indicate the need for an increase in the benchmark rate.",
        "As was mentioned before, the excessive growth of loans and the persistence of low interest rates could be a source of financial imbalances, while the excessive expansion in demand or increases in labor costs, could raise inflation expectations and lower the credibility of monetary policy in a context in which the core inflation indicators continue to grow and, (ii) even if the international financial markets remain at high levels of volatility as a result of the difficulties related to the sovereign debt problems in Europe, the level of uncertainty has not changed with respect to the previous month and the probability of a disorderly financial adjustment is low.",
        "In addition, the United States economy is expanding at a positive rate.",
        "The Board of Directors agreed by majority to keep the benchmark interest rate unaltered.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation, the inflation trend and projections, growth, and the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota, December 22, 2011",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on February 25, 2011.",
        "Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Cesar Vallejo Mr. Juan Pablo Zárate Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in January was 3.4% (0.91% for the month).",
        "This is 13 basis points (bp) more than in December.",
        "The increase in inflation compared to December was due to upward pressure from food and regulated items.",
        "The annual variation in food prices went from 4.1% in December to 4.8% in January, bolstered mainly in this instance by tradable foods and beef.",
        "Although annual inflation in perishable foods affected by winter weather remains high, its contribution to the build-up in inflation was less on this occasion than in past months.",
        "The annual change in regulated prices went from 6.6% in December to 7.0% in January, and was concentrated in fuels.",
        "In contrast, the annual variation in prices for non-tradable goods and services, excluding food and regulated items, declined from 3.5% in December to 3.4% in January.",
        "The annual change in prices for tradables, excluding food and regulated items, remained stable, but continues to be in negative terrain.",
        "As for the core inflation indicators, their average in January remained stable at 2.5%.",
        "The lowest indicator was still the CPI, excluding food and regulated items, with an annual rate of 1.7%.",
        "On the other hand, the annual change in producer prices (PPI) came to 4.3%, which is slightly less than the figure posted in December (4.4%).",
        "As to its make-up, there was an increase in the annual variation in the imported component and a decline in that of the national component.",
        "In January, inflation expectations for the end of 2011 were the same as the month before (3.6%).",
        "The situation with respect to expectations at one year and for longer periods (5 and 10 years), measured with government bonds, was similar.",
        "The latter surpass the long-term target range (2% - 4%) Growth The figures available for the end of 2010 suggest a fourth-quarter rise in GDP similar to the increase registered for the third quarter of 2010.",
        "In which case, the Colombian economy would have grown at a rate of nearly 4.0% for the year as a whole.",
        "Said performance would be based on the momentum in internal demand, fueled primarily by household consumption and by gross fixed capital formation.",
        "Despite a setback in consumer confidence during the last four months of 2010, its level in January, as measured by the Fedsarrollo indicator, is not low in historic terms.",
        "Added to this is the continued expansion in consumer lending, at high rates in December and January, and retail sales, which posted an annual increase of 12.4% in December.",
        "This being the case, it is still reasonable to expect good growth in private consumption for the final quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.",
        "Imports of capital goods, with strong growth at the end of the year, suggest the momentum in investment in capital goods is still positive.",
        "Likewise, the increase in building permits during November points to better impetus in home construction during 2011, as does the December increase in cement sales.",
        "With respect to foreign trade, total exports in dollars at December showed an annual variation of 20.1%, largely due to the mining, energy and coffee sector, which registered 30.4% annual growth.",
        "The cumulative 12- month increase in total exports is 21.1%.",
        "Total imports in dollars showed an annual variation of 30.1% in December.",
        "The cumulative 12-month increase in total imports came to 23.7%.",
        "Generally speaking, the macroeconomic conditions continue to signal an important amount of economic growth in 2011.",
        "Specifically, the expectation is still one of growing world demand, high terms of trade, which will increase compared to 2010, elevated FDI flows, a recovery in jobs, and broad terms for internal lending, with relatively low real interest rates.",
        "Accordingly, GDP is expected to perform favorably in 2011 and to be around 4.5%.",
        "Nevertheless, this expectation is surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty, given the various economic and political risks facing the world, as well as the extent of growth in public spending in Colombia Financial Variables Nominal interest rates on consumer and ordinary lending averaged 17.5% and 10.1% in January, with respective increases on the order of 65 bp and 77 bp compared to the month before.",
        "The rate on mortgage loans was 12.1%, which is 11bp less than what is was in December.",
        "The annual increase in the total gross loan portfolio in domestic currency came to 14.9% in January, as opposed to 14.1% the month before.",
        "The consumer and mortgage loan portfolios are still the most dynamic, with respective annual variations of 21.9% and 16.7%.",
        "The annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio was 13.3% by January.",
        "The interest rates on one-year and five-year government bonds rose 37 bp and 46 bp, respectively, between January 28 and January 25, 2011.",
        "Interest on the 10-year bond was 8.9%, which is 42 bp more than the rate posted on January 28.",
        "The external context is marked by the effects political unrest in certain countries is beginning to have on the economic situation worldwide.",
        "The impact, in the short term, has been a considerable jump in the price of oil and a drop in world stock markets.",
        "As for world growth, it continues to occur at two speeds.",
        "On the one hand, there are the developed countries with moderate growth, although the results for the US economy showed better than expected performance.",
        "On the other hand, the emerging economies continue to grow at a fast pace, propelled by Asia and Latin America.",
        "The better than expected performance in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2010 (2.8% annualized quarterly -a/q-) would be explained by the boost from household consumption and net exports.",
        "However, there are still a number of risks to economic recovery in the US.",
        "First of all, unemployment remains high and its duration has increased.",
        "Secondly, loans to households and companies are still at low levels and there is no sign of a revival any time soon.",
        "Thirdly, the rise in oil prices could jeopardize the gains in available household income and put the brakes on consumption.",
        "The Euro zone grew at a modest rate of 1.2% (a/q), with Germany showing high growth rates and the periphery, low growth rates or even declines in some cases.",
        "Although the past month saw less risk in the zone, measured on the basis of CDs at five years of sovereign debt, the solvency of the European peripheral economies is still in doubt and a possible intensification of the upheaval in the Euro zone cannot be ruled out.",
        "On the other hand, international commodity prices have increased in recent months because of supply and demand factors.",
        "In the case of demand, good performance by the emerging economies and an increased use of farm products to produce biofuels has brought upward pressure to bear on the price of many agricultural goods.",
        "On the supply side, the problems with weather since -2010 and recent political events have contributed to the increase in these prices.",
        "In this context, the impact of the weather is likely to subside during the course of the year.",
        "As for the impact from demand, it may last longer, since it obeys structural factors associated with the good performance expected of the emerging economies.",
        "In this environment of good world growth (fueled largely by the emerging economies) and high commodity prices, some central banks, mainly those of the emerging economies, have begun to reduce the monetary stimulus by raising their interest rates to keep inflation in check AND The Board of Directors emphasized the following aspects relative to the way inflation performed during the month: (i) Annual consumer inflation was 3.40% in January, which is similar to what the market expected and 23 basis points above the December figure.",
        "As witnessed in the two months before, most of the pressure came from prices for food and regulated items, especially fuel.",
        "(ii) The core inflation indicators remained stable, and their average is still in the lower half of the target range.",
        "(iii) The past three months saw an increase in inflation expectations, which continued during February, even though the outcome for inflation the month before was what the market expected.",
        "Although inflation expectations at one year were in the upper half of the target range, those between two and 10 years, measured with government bonds, completed two straight months above the ceiling of that range.",
        "The following was highlighted with respect to economic growth: (i) Economic growth in 2011 is forecast at around 4.5%, considering that more moderate growth during the second half of 2010, partly due to supply factors, will result in approximately 4% growth for that year.",
        "(ii) Internal demand is showing considerable momentum associated with household consumption as well as investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "(iii) The contribution from public spending is expected to be more during 2011 than in 2010.",
        "This is consistent with what is observed during periods before local administrations are about to leave office and with the programs put in place to repair the damage cause by the wave of winter weather.",
        "(iv) The forecasts for world growth in 2011 and 2012 have been revised upward at rates that continue to exceed average long-term growth, primarily due to growth in the emerging economies.",
        "The latter is manifest in historically high terms of trade for commodity-producing countries like Colombia.",
        "The members of the Board evaluated the possibility of raising intervention interest rates at this meeting, consistent with what was announced at the last meeting on whether or not to gradually reduce the monetary stimulus of past months to make the added momentum in the Colombian economy sustainable over time and to keep inflation within the long-term target range.",
        "In particular, they emphasized the following points: (i) the existence of a historically low intervention interest rate in both nominal and real terms; (ii) the risks extremely low interest rates for too long a period of time can imply for financial stability, growth and future inflation; (iii) the forecast by the Bank’s technical team, which indicates the economy will return to near capacity levels during the second half of the year; (iv) the delayed impact of monetary policy; (v) the recent momentum in internal demand, lending and the rise in home prices some time ago; (vi) the inconsistency that could result from having an exceptionally low interest rate coupled with anticipated growth in 2011 and 2012 near the trend and inflation forecast close to the -point of the long-term target range: (vii) inflation expectations over one year that surpass the target; and (viii) the stability of the exchange rate in recent weeks and the favorable results of the foreign currency purchase program.",
        "The risks in the world economy were considered as well; specifically, the continued uncertainty sparked by the fiscal situation in several industrialized countries and the rise in the international price of oil in recent weeks as a result of the political instability in the Middle East.",
        "Moreover, weather factors and the considerable momentum in the emerging economies have intensified inflationary pressure in those countries, particularly because of the recent increase in commodity prices The Board of Directors agreed to a 25 basis point increase in Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate, placing it at 3.25%.",
        "Minutes of Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colombia) Board of Directors’ Meeting of 28th October 2011 On 28[th] October 2011, in the city of Bogota, the ordinary meeting of Banco de la Republica’s Board of Directors was held with the presence of the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the General Manager Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, as well as the perspectives for both situations are discussed, and decisions relating with the monetary policy are adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the major subjects addressed at this meeting Annual consumer inflation in September was 3.73% (0.31% monthly), which means 46 basis points (bp) more than in August.",
        "The cumulative price adjustment in the year elapsed as of September is 2.95%, thus higher that the one recorded last year (2.40%) in the same period.",
        "During August, the most significant upward pressures came from the food sector.",
        "The annual variation of this basket went up to 5.7%, this being the strongest monthly increase (110 bp) in the course of the year.",
        "The main part of food inflation in this last month can be attributed to the perishables group and, particularly, the price of potatoes with increases accruing to 41% since June.",
        "These increases are of temporary nature and might be due to the late effects of the rainy season and the normal supply cycle for these products.",
        "Accordingly, these price variations are expected to revert once the production cycle is normalized.",
        "With respect to the CPI variation without foods (3%), the sharpest increase was concentrated on the regulated basket (from 5.6% to 6.5%), and it was caused by raises in energy charges in some regions of the country.",
        "The other components of the basket of regulated items (fuels, public transportation and other public services) showed more moderate increases.",
        "With respect to the CPI of tradables without foods and the regulated, a slight upward trend in the annual variation (0.16%), coinciding with exchange rate depreciation in the past two months, stands out in the annual variation.",
        "As per the non- tradables CPI without foods and the regulated, September data (3.5%) do not change in a significant way as compared with the previous month.",
        "Likewise, base inflation went up in the past month but to a lesser extent than total inflation.",
        "Although all indicators showed increases, they nevertheless remained within the target range.",
        "Inflation expectations recorded a slight increase in the most recent measurements.",
        "The Central Bank’s monthly survey shows that inflation expected by the financial market operators for the end of this year is 3.4%, at present, against 3.2% registered in the previous survey.",
        "Also inflation expected at the 12-month horizon is 3.4%, while one month ago it was 3.3%.",
        "Information obtained from the TES certificates suggests a similar behavior, with increases in the expected inflation at all horizons.",
        "The variation in the producer price index (PPI) increased at an annual 6.6% rate against 5.2% in August.",
        "Raises were concentrated in the indicator’s imported component Growth The different indicators available for the third quarter 2011 confirm that Colombian economy would have continued to expand at a high rate.",
        "Just like in the first half of the year, the third-quarter growth would have been driven by domestic demand.",
        "By type of expenditure, household consumption would continue to grow in August at high rates, as suggested by the retail sale indicators (9.7% per annum) and consumer-goods imports (30% per annum).",
        "Likewise, the real consumer credit portfolio in the third quarter of 2011 grew at an average rate of 21.6% (18.9% in the previous quarter).",
        "In September, household confidence showed further decline, as measured by Fedesarrollo; nonetheless, its level remains high, with a similar average to that registered in 2007 when consumption had grown at a rate higher than 7%.",
        "With respect to investment, perspectives are equally favorable.",
        "This can be inferred from growth observed in imports of capital goods, as regards both their machinery component and transportation equipment.",
        "In addition, the national production of these goods continues to show positive growth rates propelled by the anticipated good performance of Colombian economy.",
        "The commercial portfolio keeps growing at rates close to 20% per year.",
        "On the supply side, industry and construction indicators for the third quarter remain dynamic.",
        "In industry, a 9.5% expansion of production stands out.",
        "The Fedesarrollo survey of business opinion “Encuesta de Opinion Empresarial de Fedesarrollo” also shows good production perspectives for the sector.",
        "In construction, positive dynamism was observed in the third quarter as suggested by the behavior of cement and its national dispatches; in August, they recorded annual growths of 9.6% and 22.2% respectively.",
        "The sector’s -term trends are also favorable as indicated by the area being approved for construction pursuant to licenses granted.",
        "It continued to grow in August mainly propelled by the part destined to the residential segment.",
        "In contrast, a reduction is expected in the agricultural sector’s production for the third quarter, due to the impact of climatic factors particularly on the coffee crop.",
        "Total exports in August grew at an annual 50% rate.",
        "This growth was originated in increased sales of crude oil and by- products, coal, and industrial products.",
        "The impetus seen in exports of mining origin can be explained by the behavior of both prices and amounts, the indexes of which recorded annual increases of 38% and 22% respectively.",
        "Exports of basic foods of agricultural origin had a lower annual variation (4.2% per year) in August, but, instead, their recovery was slight with respect to the previous month.",
        "The price and amount indexes calculated suggest that the increase is more clearly explained by prices (13% per year).",
        "In August, external sales without basic products ( industrial goods and other agricultural products) showed an equally significant annual growth (41%).",
        "It was observed in both prices (14%) and amounts (26%).",
        "Regarding employment, DANE information as of August suggests that growth in labor demand was higher than labor supply.",
        "This allowed unemployment and underemployment rates to keep on falling during the past few months.",
        "Taking all the above into account, the different forecasting models gave a growth interval between 6% and 7% for the third quarter’s GDP.",
        "For the rest of the year, the models do not foresee any important changes in the trends of the macroeconomic variables and, for the whole year 2011, they predict a GDP growth between 5% and 6%.",
        "With respect to 2012, the models suggest a slightly lower growth as compared with the expectations for 2011.",
        "These results derive from the projections obtained for key variables like raw-material prices and world’s growth Financial variables Total credit in national currency [“moneda nacional”] (MN) and foreign currency [“moneda extranjera”] (“ME”) was maintained at high growth rates, above the estimate for the nominal 2011 GDP.",
        "As of September, total (MN and ME) credit was incremented at an annual rate of 23.5%, higher by 38 bp to that observed in August.",
        "The consumption portfolio recorded the highest growth rate: 25.8%, exceeding the August rate by 88 bp.",
        "On its side, the mortgage portfolio remained at the annual growth rate of 17.3% prevailing in the previous month.",
        "In September, real interest rates (excluding CPI without foods) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial credits, were placed at 15.1%, 10.0% and 8.0%, The Greek debt crisis and the vulnerability of the countries in the European periphery to the likelihood of contagion have continued to affect the markets face to the systemic risks currently threatening the Eurozone stability and the weak United States economic growth.",
        "In the Eurozone, there is a growing possibility of a recession, this contributing to force a decline in growth forecasts.",
        "On their sides, the most recent (September) indicators regarding the manufacturing and services activity are contracting, and the exporting dynamism has diminished.",
        "In the United States, consumer confidence has fallen to very low levels in the past three months (October); this is reflecting in a moderate consumption growth.",
        "Likewise, supply indicators are pointing out at deceleration but, as yet, without showing backward movements in their levels.",
        "Moreover, the deterioration of the economic and financial situation in Europe, and the effects this may have on world demand, may continue to be a limiting factor to their exports.",
        "The United States’ economic growth for the third quarter 2011 reached 2.5%, a higher figure than the one being incorporated in the external demand projections.",
        "The emerging economies keep on expanding, but at a slower pace.",
        "The GDP in China decelerated in the third quarter and might continue to decline in the remainder of the year, given the predicted weakening of Chinese external demand.",
        "In the case of Brazil, a strong deceleration is anticipated as of September in the country’s industrial activity, as well as a significant reduction in its GDP growth during the second semester of the year.",
        "As a result of the above, the technical team reduced this year’s growth forecasts for the major developed economies.",
        "Nevertheless, the GDP growth for the set of Colombia’s commercial partners was maintained because price increases in some countries like Ecuador were revised, given the recent trends.",
        "For next year, growth forecasts were significantly reduced for the developed economies and the emerging ones as well.",
        "Overall, in 2012, our main partners’ growth, though positive, is expected to be lower.",
        "It is assumed in this estimation that the economic authorities will adopt credible measures to alleviate the sovereign debt problems in order to ensure the soundness of their financial systems so as to restore the agents’ confidence.",
        "Face to the diminished perspectives of world growth, international price forecasts for basic goods exported by Colombia were also reduced, particularly for 2012.",
        "Projections take into account the recent trends showed by these quotations in the past three months.",
        "The expected reduction in both basic goods prices and world growth will lead to containment of inflationary pressures in the developed economies.",
        "With this, the comfortable position of the monetary policy should be maintained longer than previously planned.",
        "Particularly, the reference rates in the United States and Europe are expected to remain at very low levels, at least until 2013.",
        "In the case of the emerging economies, pressures upon prices may lessen more slowly, thus making it harder to predict falls in the interest rates.",
        "To conclude, the external demand growth for next year is uncertain, and it involves high risks.",
        "If the European Union succeeds in refraining fiscal insolvency fears, there is a probability of obtaining a moderate world growth in 2012.",
        "Otherwise, if the situation in Europe gets more complicated and if the United States does not ratify the previous quarter’s growth trend, the scenario becomes less favorable and it would include a recession in the Eurozone.",
        "In this last scenario, both consumers and investors’ confidence in emerging economies might be reduced, in this way affecting their domestic demand and the capital market.",
        "Also a reduction in national income may occur, since a depressed external demand tends to generate decreases in the prices of the basic goods like those our country usually exports.",
        "Should this last situation occur, its worst negative impact would occur in 2012 AND Some members of the Board suggested that the Bank’s intervention rate should be increased by 25 basis points, taking into account the following reasons: (i) Annual consumer inflation in September was 3.73% (0.31% monthly), 46 bp more than in August; (ii) Short-term forecasts indicate that inflation will be above the middle point of the target range by the end of 2011.",
        "Base inflation measures and inflation expectations have recovered again; (iii) The new information available is still reflecting a very dynamic internal demand, propelled by both private consumption and investment.",
        "If confidence and international prices for the main export products remain at high levels, it is to be expected that the strong dynamism of demand would be extended over the next quarters and would generate capacity pressures; (vi) Although the annual growth of bank credit was stabilized, this was achieved at a high rate.",
        "The most dynamic portfolio is the consumer portfolio with increases almost threefold the nominal GDP growth estimated for 2011.",
        "Price indexes of new and used housing reached the maximum records in the series.",
        "The strong dynamism of these financial indicators, usually associated with demand excess and unbalance risks, may be explained in part by real interest rates still remaining at low levels; (v) A timely increase of the Bank’s interest rates contributes to the preservation of inflation within the target range, and reduces the risks of financial unbalances subsequently leading to unnecessary volatility of both product and employment; (vi) Uncertainty about the evolution of the world’s economy should not delay those decisions that are necessary for the stability of Colombian economy.",
        "Other members of the Board shared the concern expressed by the first group, but they deemed appropriate to keep the interest rate unaltered, taking into account those external factors that reflect higher risks and more uncertainty.",
        "However, if international confidence tends to recover and real domestic indicators continue to show their current dynamism, and no major contagion by the external situation is seen, the economy is likely to require lesser monetary stimulus.",
        "Other Board members considered that it is desirable to maintain the Bank’s interest rates taking into account that: (i) With respect to 2012, models show a lower growth than expected for 2011.",
        "These results derive from the projections at hand for key variables such as the price of raw materials and the world’s growth.",
        "In general terms, the internal -term outlook appears to be less favorable as a consequence of the probable effects of the developed economies’ low dynamics.",
        "(ii) The agreement signed at dawn on the 27[th] October at Brussels to avert the deep European crisis left enormous and unanswered questions, like the lack of a definition regarding the delicate situation of Italy and the progressive raise in the country’s debt cost, as well as the capitalization of the Eurozone banks and the types of involvement of the major emerging economies in the financing of the rescue fund, among other issues; (iii) The more recent predictions regarding the United States’ growth are seriously deteriorated; (iv) A less dynamic world economy would reduce the excessive increase in asset prices and credit growth in the near future; (v) Although the inflation record has increased, this increment seems temporary and it is due to both the delayed effects of the rainy season and the normal cycle of perishable foods supply.",
        "In addition, the Bank’s technical team predicts inflation decreases in the next 6 months; (vi) The base inflation measures have not changed significantly as compared with the previous month; this suggests that demand pressures on prices have been moderated.",
        "Generally, all the inflation indicators have remained within the target range; (vii) Credit dynamics and the increasing value of assets may be due to structural factors, and not only to a low interest rate; (viii) In any ways, imagining prudential regulation measures additional to the interest rate is justified; (ix) Market interest rates have increased recently; this suggests that there is no excess liquidity level in the economy The Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to keep the intervention interest rate unaltered at 4.5%.",
        "The Board will continue to carefully monitor the international situation, the inflation behavior and projections, and growth, as well as the active markets performance; and it insists that monetary policy will depend upon the new information available.",
        "Minutes of the Banco de la Republica Board of Director’s meeting on June 17, 2011 On June 17, 20101, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica was held in the city of Bogota.",
        "Present were: Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of the Treasury and Public Credit Jose Dario Uribe, the General Director Full-time Board members present: Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz Juan Jose Echavarria Soto Fernando Tenjo Galarza Cesar Vallejo Mejia and Juan Pablo Zarate Perdomo The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made in relation to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting Annual consumer inflation in May was 3.02% (monthly was 0.28%), which was 18 basis points (bp) higher than in April.",
        "This figure was in line with what was projected by the Bank’s technical team but was lower than the market expected.",
        "The main upward pressures came from the prices for food–both perishables and processed food.",
        "As of May the annual variation for food was 3.6%, a percentage that corrects an unexpected slowdown for this group in the month of April.",
        "Inflation excluding food (2.81%) just like the average of all of the indicators for core inflation remained relatively stable.",
        "The annual variation of the prices for non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices rose 5 bp and came to 3.5% in May.",
        "In contrast that of the prices for regulated goods and the one for tradables excluding food and regulated prices declined 26 bp and 4 bp respectively as they stood at 6.15% and -0.1% in May.",
        "Inflation expectations for two and three years from now slowed back down and are within the target range.",
        "For the end of the year, the monthly expectations survey done of analysts suggests that inflation will be at 3.2%, a number that is slightly higher than what was obtained in April (3.1%).",
        "The annual variation of producer prices (PPI) was 4.8% in May compared to 4.7% in April.",
        "The rises have been concentrated in goods from the agricultural sector Growth For the first quarter, the latest activity indicators suggest that the annual rate of growth for the economy could be slightly below what was seen at the end of 2010.",
        "This slowdown is primarily explained by an unexpected fall in construction, especially in public works projects, The support from the net foreign demand will be negative since real imports rose more rapidly than exports.",
        "With respect to expenditures, the GDP has been driven by domestic demand because of both investment other than construction and household consumption in the first quarter of this year.",
        "Just like in 2010, during that quarter the greater strength within private consumption was from that of semi-durable and durable goods (, automobiles).",
        "This was favored by the low interest rates and wide availability of credit.",
        "With respect to investment, the poor result from public works projects implies a significant slowdown in the investment in fixed capital.",
        "However, the rest of the components of this area such as investment in machinery and transportation equipment have shown significant growth as shown by the imports of permanent assets.",
        "For the second quarter of 2011, the limited indicators available do not make it possible to consider a significant slowdown in growth.",
        "The sales of vehicles continued to grow at a good rate which suggests that durable consumption will remain high.",
        "This is being confirmed by the momentum of consumption imports (annual growth as of April 30.5%), the growth of consumer credit (22.4% as of May) and the perception of businessmen about their current sales.",
        "In April, the indicators for the labor market reflected an improvement in the quantity and quality of employment.",
        "The creation of employment was concentrated in wage-earning labor and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped in comparison to what had been seen in March and February.",
        "These facts may continue to drive household consumption strength.",
        "The favorable trend in the indicators of household expenditures described above has not been in line with the trend of the consumer confidence index calculated by Fedesarrollo.",
        "In April and May, this index deteriorated, especially due to the fall in willingness to buy housing or durable goods.",
        "In April, foreign sales of Colombian products in dollars continued growing at a high rate (34.6% annually in value and 2.5% in volume) although this was lower than what had been seen the month before (46.4% and 7.4% respectively).",
        "Exports were again driven by the positive performance of products like coffee, coal, nickel-iron, gold, petroleum and its derivatives in the international market.",
        "The rest of the foreign sales in dollars grew 9.1% and those for markets other than Venezuela grew 12.8%.",
        "Respecting imports, their growth continues to be strong (32.2%).",
        "It is estimated that so far this year, the real growth of imports surpasses that of exports.",
        "As a result of that, the contribution of net foreign demand to the GDP remains in negative territory.",
        "The indicators associated with supply continued to show positive performance.",
        "For example, the total demand for energy as of May grew again in annual terms.",
        "Specifically, industry’s demand for non-regulated energy showed a significant strength.",
        "In industry, the indicators for orders and inventory still showed positive performance.",
        "Nevertheless, the balance on 3-month production expectations fell although that deterioration not imply a break in the indicator’s tendency component.",
        "The possibly transitory character of the performance of public works projects as well as the limited information available for the second quarter does not permit the consideration of any important change in the growth forecast for 2011.",
        "Therefore, a growth range of between 4% and 6% is maintained 2011.",
        "Total credit in national (NC) and foreign currency (FC) continued rising.",
        "As of May, all of the types of credit, including not only households but also companies, registered growth that was much higher than the 2011 GDP estimate.",
        "This has occurred in a context of real interest rates that are historically low.",
        "As of May the real credit (NC and FC) rose 22.4% annually, data which is 93 bp higher than that registered in April.",
        "The consumer and commercial portfolio (NC and FC) registered increases of 22.4% and 22.8% in May which is 122 bp and 81 bp higher respectively to what had been seen a month earlier.",
        "The mortgage portfolio declined 91 bp and was at 17.6% for the month.",
        "In May, real interest rates (discounting the consumer price index without food) for credits on consumption, housing and commerce, were 14,6%, 9,7% y 7,1%, below its historical levels since 1998 Foreign context In the second quarter of 2011, the world economy confirmed the recovery which started in 2009.",
        "However, this recovery could be slower since the latest information available shows that the developed countries have not totally recovered from the consequences of the past recession yet.",
        "They could also be facing a temporary slowdown associated with the difficulties Japan is facing.",
        "In those conditions the current momentum of the worldwide economy is largely explained by the performance of the emerging countries.",
        "In the United States in particular, the recovery continues at a moderate pace and the new information on the indicators of economic activity suggest that the growth in the second quarter could be slowing down.",
        "This evolution is primarily explained by the lower strength in domestic demand affected by the cuts in public expenditures and the high prices of fuel.",
        "In addition, the unemployment rate rose again in May and the number of jobs created was lower than it was for previous months.",
        "In contrast, exports continued growing in nominal and real terms and their rate of expansion for the first four months of the year has been above that for imports.",
        "This has made it possible to reduce the trade deficit.",
        "In addition, the debt crisis in the most fragile countries in the Euro Zone (Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) has raised the level of concern about the fiscal sustainability of those economies.",
        "The lack of a definite solution for the situation in Greece is having an impact on the stock markets all over the world in view of the fear that US and European banks could be affected.",
        "In the case of Japan, the industrial production index showed evidence of some recovery in April after a sharp fall due to the natural disaster.",
        "It is hoped that in the second half of the year this activity will begin to recovery more clearly.",
        "The international prices for food and petroleum continue to be historically high in spite of some reductions in the last few months.",
        "These drops are due to the increase in uncertainty with respect to the performance of the developed countries and to the fact that the supply seems to be covering the current necessities.",
        "With respect to the emerging economies, the industrial production indices continue to show favorable performance except for the case of Brazil where there was a slight drop.",
        "However, in China and India inflation rose in May indicating that the pressures on prices are still present.",
        "This situation will continue to affect the monetary policy decisions and should lead to a moderation in the rate of growth for these economies AND The board members’ main points of discussion and analysis focused on the following aspects: (i) the sharp drop in the investment in public works projects in the first quarter.",
        "This decline was not expected and probably is transitory in character, (ii) the international uncertainty due to the decline of the indicators of activity for the United States and to the debt crisis in the Euro Zone, (iii) the historically low level of the Bank’s benchmark interest rate and of a large part of the real interest rates and their possible future effect on the solidity of the financial system if this is maintained for an excessively prolonged period of time, (iv) the continuing growth of all of the components of credit and the debt held by households, (v) the historically high level of the terms of trade and their contribution to the growth of national revenue, (vi) the strong performance of private demand in both consumption and investment in machinery and equipment, (vii) the better indicators of employment quality in the labor market, (viii) the high probability that the level of output will be near its potential in the second half of the year, (ix) the inflation expectations for the short and medium term that have corrected downward and are within the target range, (x) the recent appreciation of the peso, (xi) the pressure of food and petroleum prices on international inflation, (xii) the inflationary pressures in many countries along with increases in the interest rates of some central banks in Latin America and Asia.",
        "Some members of the Board expressed their opinion that the Bank’s benchmark rate should be raised 25 bp for the following reasons: (i) although certain uncertainties have been introduced into the growth of the GDP, especially because of the external risks and the carrying out of public works projects, the available information shows a strong momentum in domestic demand including both investment other than construction and household consumption.",
        "The later seems to be confirmed by the annual growth of 22.4% in consumer credit and by the strength shown by retail sales so far this year.",
        "(ii) The current real rate is below its probable long term balance and is inconsistent with the growth that is expected to be close to its potential in 2011 and 2012 and a projected inflation that is close to the midpoint of the long term target range.",
        "(iii) The consecutive, early increase in the Bank’s interest rates contributes to keeping inflation within the target range and reduces the risk of financial imbalances that later lead to an unnecessary volatility in the interest rates, output and employment.",
        "In the opinion of this group of members of the Board, a monetary posture corresponding to a benchmark interest rate of a nominal 4.25% is still expansionary.",
        "Another member of the Board also considered it appropriate to raise the Bank’s benchmark rate by 25 basis points in order to ensure a positive level in real terms.",
        "Nevertheless, he warned that in the current phase of the economic cycle this should be the last movement given that the indicators show that both total and core inflation as well as expectations are controlled and anchored to the goal.",
        "He also believed that the difference with respect to the rates of our main trading partner, the United States, should not be widened anymore.",
        "The monetary authority there will probably not raise them before the end of next year due to the stagnation of the economy and to the fears of a double-dip recession.",
        "The change in the foreign currency portfolio resulting from this differential is alarming since its annual growth has gone from 134% in March to 170% in May.",
        "In view of that, complementary measures of macro-prudential regulation should be considered from now on instead of over using the interest rate.",
        "Finally, he observed that the export and foreign investment boom is concentrated in the energy-mining sector which explains 80% of the strength of the first one and 85% of the size of the second while it barely generates 200,000 jobs.",
        "An unmistakable symptom of the Holland disease.",
        "Another member of the Board considered that it is not convenient to increase the Bank’s benchmark rate in this opportunity.",
        "The different inflation indicators are within the target range of 3% +/- 1 percentage point, GDP growth is close to its historical level, and the confidence surveys on consumers, manufacturers and merchants show important reductions.",
        "In addition, the international economy has slowed down in the recent months.",
        "This scenario justifies waiting to the next meeting of the board, in order to count with additional solid information on interest rates The Board of Directors agreed by majority to raise the benchmark rate of the Banco de la Republica by 25 basis points which will put it at 4.25%.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation, the inflation trend and projections, growth, the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota July 1, 2011",
        "Minutes of the Banco de la República Board of Director’s meeting on November 25, 2011 On November 25, 2011, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogota.",
        "Present were: Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of the Treasury and Public Credit Jose Dario Uribe, the General Director Full-time Board members present: Carlos Gustavo Cano Juan Jose Echavarría Fernando Tenjo Juan Pablo Zarate and Cesar Vallejo The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made with respect to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting Annual consumer inflation in October was 4.02% (0.19% monthly), which is 29 basis points (bp) more than in September.",
        "The adjustment of accumulated prices over the course of the year is 3.15%, which is higher than what had been registered during the same period last year (2.31%).",
        "Just as in September, the most important upward pressures in October came from food.",
        "The annual change for this basket rose to 6.6% in October compared to 5.7% in September.",
        "The upsurge was concentrated in the prices of perishable foods, especially potatoes, as has been seen for several months.",
        "There were also rises in less perishable food items.",
        "Using the subdivision of the food basket into food affected by weather, imported food, and the remainder, the products affected by the weather were seen to lead the price rally for the basket with an increase of 15.1% recorded in October compared to 12.2% in September while the imported food (6.5%) not show significant rises compared to the previous month.",
        "The rest of the food items (4.7%) rose 70 bp compared to what was registered in September.",
        "Supply problems associated with the heavy rain in the first half of the year as well as the normal price and production cycle would explain these registers.",
        "Inflation excluding food in October was 3.03% with a slight increase (5 bp) with respect to the data from September.",
        "Since October 2009, the indicator has not been above the -point of the target range.",
        "In October, the performance of the sub-baskets of the CPI excluding food was uneven.",
        "There was a significant increase in the annual variation of the CPI for tradables excluding food and regulated prices.",
        "This indicator, which registered 0.4% for the month, seems to be establishing itself in positive territory after 16 consecutive months of showing negative figures.",
        "That is partly related to the depreciation in the exchange rate in the last few months.",
        "The annual variation for non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices remained at 3.5%.",
        "Rent has been showing a stable annual variation for several months and one that is close to 3% which offsets higher prices in educational and health services.",
        "With respect to the annual change in basket of regulated prices (6.3%), there was a decline due to the electricity fees that, nonetheless, was much less than predicted.",
        "The rises in the prices for residential natural gas continued in October due to the increases in the international prices for fuel in the first half of the year.",
        "The indicators for core inflation continued to show a rising trend over the last month.",
        "The average for the three indicators announced by the Banco de la Republica was 3.27%, 14 bp more than a month ago.",
        "Even if all the indicators rose, they would still be within the target range.",
        "The increase in inflation affected the expectation indicators.",
        "Those obtained on the basis of the TES climbed for all of the horizons with the ones for 10 years surpassing the top of the target range a little.",
        "The measurements done through surveys show less pronounced increases.",
        "For example, according to the monthly survey, the inflation expected for December, 2011 is 3.6% and that expected for 12 months from now is 3.4%.",
        "In the quarterly survey, the expectation for 12 months from now is 3.7%.",
        "The change in producer prices (PPI) continued to rise in October and adjusted to an annual rate of 7.9% compared to 6.6% in September.",
        "The increases, as in previous months, were concentrated in the import component of the indicator Growth Growth in the third quarter, like that in the first half of the year, will still be driven domestic demand as can be inferred from the most recent information on retail sales measured by DANE.",
        "Their annual growth in September was 7.2%.",
        "Moreover, imports of consumer goods in dollars grew in September at an annual rate of 26% and the consumer loan portfolio registered an annual growth of 25.8% in the month of September.",
        "Investment, in turn, also showed a good performance in the third quarter.",
        "With respect to that, the growth registered for imports of capital goods in September (25%) suggests that the expenditures on machinery and equipment remain strong.",
        "Developments in commercial loan portfolio, which expanded at a rate of 22.2% in the same month, point in the same direction.",
        "Investment in construction would also have continued growing based on the developments in building licenses.",
        "With respect to the supply, in September the annual variation in the industrial production index was 5.2%.",
        "The annual growth of production for the entire third quarter was high (6.2%) mainly influenced by what had been registered in August.",
        "The indicators associated with the manufacturing industry such as Fedesarrollo orders and inventory remained stable as of September and even at levels that suggest a significant expansion rate for the sector.",
        "With respect to foreign sales, the effect of the weaker foreign context had not been important up until September.",
        "That being the case, total exports in dollars rose at an annual rate of 36%.",
        "This growth came from higher sales of crude oil and its derivatives, coal, and gold.",
        "The boost in exports from mining was due to the trend in both price (32%) and quantities (4%).",
        "Exports of agricultural commodities have not shown any recovery.",
        "In fact, they registered an annual drop of 4.1% in September.",
        "The indices of price and calculated quantities suggest that this reduction was explained by the tightening registered in the quantities (-16% annually), which was not offset by the price increase (12% annually).",
        "The fall in quantity came from the lower foreign sales of coffee (-21%) and flowers (-19%).",
        "Finally, foreign sales of industrial goods and other agricultural products (excluding commodities) showed an annual growth of 4.3% in September.",
        "The rise was seen only in prices (9%) while the quantities registered a contraction (-5%).",
        "With respect to the labor market, the unemployment rate continued its declining trend in September.",
        "Its reduction responded again to a growth in the demand for labor (measured by the employment rate) that is greater than the supply (measured by the overall rate of participation).",
        "For not only the 13 areas but also the national total, the number of people working continued to rise at rates close to 5% which is in line with what has been registered throughout 2011.",
        "The above mentioned indicators with information up to the third quarter confirmed the forecast given in the last Report on Inflation when an annual expansion of the economy was projected to be between 6% and 7% for that period.",
        "For the fourth quarter of the year, the few indicators available suggest a slight slowdown in private consumption in comparison to the third quarter which will be concentrated in the durable goods component.",
        "This was deduced from the reduction in consumer confidence for the fourth consecutive month that was seen in the month of October (together with the willingness to purchase cars and housing components) and due to the slowdown in automobile sales in the same month.",
        "This trend, however, is in line with what was expected in the estimates from the previous report.",
        "In this, the growth of the economy for all of 2011 would be between 5% and 6%.",
        "With respect to the loan situation and finances in the real sector, the aggregate indicators calculated on the basis of the intermediary reports as of the third quarter of 2011 is not showing signs of excess yet in spite of the fact that the portfolio is maintaining a high pace of real growth.",
        "However, information from some segments such as consumer credit are signaling a significant increase in household indebtedness and a slight deterioration in the latest harvests (according to the most recent data available at the Financial Superintendency) Financial Variables: The total loans in national currency (NC) and foreign currency (FC) are staying at high rates of growth with a slight moderation in October.",
        "All of the types of loans for both homes and businesses continue to register growth that is well above the growth of economic activity.",
        "This has occurred in a context of historically low, real interest rates.",
        "As of October, the total growth of credit (NC and FC) registered an annual rate of 22.7%, which is 118 bp lower than what was observed in September.",
        "The consumer loan portfolio showed the highest rate of growth, 25.4%, which is 32 bp lower compared to the previous month.",
        "The commercial loan portfolio, in turn, showed an annual rate of growth of 22.0%, which is 113 bp lower than what had been registered in the month of September while the mortgage portfolio remained at a growth rate of 17.3% annually as has been seen since August.",
        "In October, the real interest rates (not counting the CPI excluding food) for consumer, mortgage, and ordinary commercial loans were at 14.9%, 10.0%, and 8.1%, figures that are lower than the averages seen since 1998 Foreign Context In the third quarter of 2011, the main developed economies registered a GDP growth that was better than expected.",
        "Nevertheless, the probability that there would be a recession in Europe rose while the market consensus is that the economy of the United States may expand at a moderate rate for a prolonged period.",
        "In view of this panorama and with the large emerging countries growing at rates that are close to their potential, the forecast for 2012 indicates that worldwide activity will continue to slow down but without reaching the point of recession.",
        "The improved growth seen in the main developed countries could be associated with the reestablishment of production conditions in Japan and a reduction in the price of fuel.",
        "In Germany, France, and Japan, growth in the third quarter surged with respect to what had been registered between March and June.",
        "In spite of the revision of the GDP in the United States which was corrected from 2.5% to 2.0%, there was a similar situation there that was announced recently.",
        "In spite of the above, the international markets continue to show a high aversion to risk due to the situation in Europe.",
        "In the United States, the little information available for the fourth quarter shows that real activity continues growing though slowly.",
        "This eases fears of a possible recession in the short term.",
        "However, the risks are being kept low and damage in the European situation could have a considerable affect on the growth of this country.",
        "In this context, the forecast in the September Report on Inflation of moderate growth for this country over a prolonged period remains the same.",
        "In Europe, the economic activity indicators continue to deteriorate, especially in the countries on the periphery.",
        "Furthermore, the agreements and measures directed towards solving the public debt and financial system problems have not had the expected impact so far.",
        "All of this has had repercussions in a deterioration in consumer and investor confidence and has infected the largest and most stable economies in the region.",
        "Given this, it is probable that the growth forecast for the Euro Zone in 2012 will be reduced with respect to what was presented in the previous report.",
        "The emerging economies are still losing strength.",
        "In China, real activity has continued to slow down and this has been confirmed by the latest industrial data.",
        "There is a similar situation in India and Brazil although the deterioration in the indicators has been more pronounced in these countries.",
        "The financial markets have been paying close attention to how the public debt is being handled on the periphery of Europe.",
        "In the last few weeks, the interest rate spreads for the government bonds of Italy and Spain rose.",
        "The contagion is also reaching France and Germany.",
        "In the economies of Latin America, the risk premiums have not risen significantly and their exchange rates have tended to depreciate moderately compared to the dollar.",
        "The weak foreign demand and the more limited outlook for worldwide growth have reduced the pressures on the international prices for food which eased a little in the last few months.",
        "In the case of petroleum, in spite of the rises in the WTI seen in the last two months, the levels are still lower than those reached in April, 2011.",
        "Starting from this last date, the Brent quotation has had a declining trend.",
        "All of the above has made a reduction in inflationary pressures possible in the developed economies and various emerging economies (with the exception of India).",
        "Monetary policy remains very lax in the developed countries.",
        "The European Central Bank reduced their benchmark rate by 25 basis points in their November meeting while the central banks of Japan and England kept their benchmark rates close to zero.",
        "With respect to the emerging economies, except for the case of India, the central banks tended to keep their policy rates the same.",
        "The international quotations for the main commodities that Colombia exports have also been affected though moderately.",
        "Nevertheless, their levels remain high and continue to drive the national income.",
        "This situation could partly explain the performance of exports in dollars in September.",
        "These grew at high rates, especially those from the mining sector.",
        "In industrial sales abroad, there has been somewhat of a slowdown, but it is still too early to conclude that this is a result of a lower foreign demand AND Some of the members of the Board expressed their opinion that the Bank’s benchmark rate should be raised 25 bp for the following reasons: (i) Even if the foreign situation has deteriorated, the main scenario of the forecast is that economic activity in Europe continues to weaken but without a chaotic situation or collapse occurring.",
        "At the same time, the market consensus is that the United States economy is expanding at a moderate pace over a prolonged period.",
        "(ii) Even if the foreign situation has deteriorated and some domestic indicators are showing moderation since the last report, inflation and inflation expectations rose.",
        "This could put the target and credibility of monetary policy at risk in a context in which the policy interest rate seems to reflect an expansionary monetary policy.",
        "The decisions on wages and other prices at the beginning of 2012 will be made in the context of a supply shock with inflation below but close to 4% and a tight labor market.",
        "In addition, depreciation of the peso seems to be affecting the prices of tradables.",
        "(iii) The deterioration in external conditions and the moderating of some domestic indicators do not seem to be enough to offset a domestic performance characterized by excesses of demand that possibly could threaten the inflation target and output stability even in the medium term due to financial imbalances.",
        "In spite of the slowdown in some indicators, they are remaining at high levels and others are staying high and not slowing down.",
        "(iv) Commercial lending continues to grow at a high annual rate.",
        "The strongest portfolio is that of household consumption.",
        "Households seem to be significantly raising their degree of leverage.",
        "Price indices for new and used housing are at their maximums.",
        "Commercial lending at a higher interest rate would contribute to an appropriate measurement of the risk.",
        "(v) In making policy decisions, the risks and costs of mistakes should always be pondered.",
        "Given the lags in monetary policy, doing nothing if the economy remains strong would imply risking the credibility and reputation of the policy itself and could lead to creating unnecessary volatility in interest rates and the GDP.",
        "Given the same lags, increasing the rates today might not bring about a heavy cost if the foreign situation suddenly deteriorates in the near future.",
        "This is easily detectable and the policy would be reversed.",
        "Bearing in mind the forecast described before, and the risks of financial imbalances, it would be prudent to raise the benchmark interest rate 25 basis points.",
        "It is believed that through this movement, a monetary posture that would contribute to maximizing a growth of output and employment that would be consistent with reaching future inflation targets could be achieved.",
        "This decision also incorporates the possibility of detecting a substantial change in foreign economic conditions on time and reacting to them rapidly.",
        "Other members of the Board thought it would be advisable to keep the Bank’s interest rates stable bearing in mind the facts that: (i) Even if it is true that annual inflation hit the ceiling of the target range as of October, the cause is a transitory food supply shock due to weather conditions.",
        "As a matter of fact, the price rise for food was 6.63% in contrast with 1.69% and 1.64% during the same period in 2009 and 2010 respectively.",
        "And those that were the most affected by the weather grew 15% or, in other words, three times more than the imported food items and other national ones.",
        "Furthermore, the CPI excluding food has been at the -point of the target range (3.05%, 2.57%, and 3.03% in 2009, 2010, and 2011 respectively).",
        "At the same time, inflation of non-tradables excluding food and regulated prices, which more faithfully reflects possible demand pressures, has been declining: 4.57%, 3.53%, and 3.49% for October of 2009, 2010, and 2011 respectively.",
        "Moreover, the technical team at the Bank continues to forecast declines in inflation over the next six months.",
        "(ii) In Europe, the agreements and measures aimed at solving the public debt and financial system problems have not had the expected impact and the situation has continued to deteriorate markedly since the last Board meeting.",
        "The credit rating agencies have lowered the ratings of various countries in the zone, the debt spreads have grown markedly, and not even Germany has been immune to market fears.",
        "Several analysts are projecting a recession in different European countries in 2012 and do not rule out the possibility that the model that led to the Euro could fail.",
        "(iii) In the United States, the Super Committee, made up of Democrats and Republicans to submit a proposal designed to reduce the fiscal deficit over the next ten years, failed and the growth forecast has also declined substantially over the last year.",
        "(iv) China will continue to grow at high rates but the news has not been exceptionally encouraging in the last few months.",
        "There are symptoms of contraction in industry.",
        "The prices for housing are showing the effects of sharp falls and the same thing is happening to the growth of construction.",
        "The point has been reached where the monetary authority has started a new phase of expansionary monetary measures.",
        "(v) In Latin America, industry has lost momentum and several of the economies have cooled down.",
        "The Central Bank of Brazil has lowered their rates in recent months and the ones in Mexico, Chile and Peru have kept them the same with announcements of downward biases if the world economic conditions continue to deteriorate.",
        "Why should Colombia be different from the rest of the world except for India or Iceland?",
        "(vi) The real repo interest rate in Colombia is below its historical average but the same thing is happening in the majority of the countries around the world.",
        "(vii) Different variables have begun to show a lower momentum in recent months possibly as a result of the international situation.",
        "In the Fedesarrollo survey, consumer expectations have fallen for four consecutive months; industrial performance declined from 9.7% in August to 5.2% in September; the annual rate of growth for foreign sales excluding commodities in September was 4.3%, which was a slowdown compared to the 41% registered in August; and consumer loans have been dropping from 34.1% in June, 2011 to 23.4% in November when the annualized variations from the last 13 weeks are considered.",
        "(viii) The performance of loans and growth of asset value could be due to structural factors and not only to a low interest rate.",
        "(ix) In any case, there is justification to think about prudential regulatory measures in addition to the interest rate.",
        "The models available in the Bank suggest that an increase of 25 points in the interest rate would lower loan performance marginally.",
        "(x) Market interest rates have risen recently which suggests that the economy does not have excessive liquidity The Board of Directors agreed by majority to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points which will put it at 4.75%.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation, the inflation trend and projections, growth, and the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota, December 9, 2011",
        "Minutes of the Banco de la Republica Board of Director’s meeting on July 29, 2011 A regular meeting of Banco de la República’s Board of Directors was held in the city of Bogotá on July 29, 2011.",
        "Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Cesar Vallejo The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made in relation to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting Annual consumer inflation in June was 3.23% (monthly was 0.32%), which was 21 basis points (bp) higher than in May.",
        "This number surpassed what was projected by the Bank’s technical team and higher than the market expected on average.",
        "The main upward pressures came from the prices for food–specifically the perishables and those most affected by the climate and, secondly, imported food.",
        "As of June the annual variation for food was 4.1%.",
        "In the case of imported food items, the surges in the international prices at the end of 2010 continued to be transferred slowly and moderately to domestic prices.",
        "The peso’s accumulated appreciation had partly compensated for these external pressures.",
        "With respect to perishables, the rises in prices have been concentrated in vegetables and fruit and could be the result of the heavy seasonal rain in March and April as well as the normal supply cycle for these products.",
        "Inflation excluding food (2.91%) just like the average of all of the indicators for core inflation rose.",
        "The annual variation in the prices for non-tradable goods excluding food and regulated prices rose 33 bp and came to 3.83% in June.",
        "The annual variation of the CPI for non-tradable goods excluding regulated prices has been climbing slowly since March even after discounting for the effect of amusement, cultural, and vacation activities in June.",
        "In contrast, the change in the prices for regulated items and for the subgroup of tradable goods excluding food and regulated prices declined 19 bp and 5 bp respectively going to 5.96% and -0.13% in June.",
        "The variation in the producer prices (PPI) dropped in June and was at an annual rate of 4.7% compared to 4.8% in May.",
        "The reductions were concentrated in the imported component of the indicator.",
        "The different measurements of inflation expectations (market expectations and expectations calculated on the basis of public debt securities) were within the long term target range (2% to 4%) Growth In the first quarter of 2011, the GDP grew 5.1% in annual terms and rose 1.9% with respect to the immediately preceding quarter.",
        "Household consumption was the aggregate that contributed the most to the expansion of the GDP.",
        "In the first quarter it grew at a rate that was above the average for the last decade driven above all by the purchases of durable and semi-durable goods.",
        "The contribution of the total investment was equally important since it registered a rate of growth that was higher than the average for last year and completed a year and a half of continuous expansion.",
        "However, net exportations continued to contribute negatively to the GDP because, even though exports grew at a good pace, imports grew at an even higher rate.",
        "In the area of supply, the significant expansions that the commerce, mining and agricultural sectors registered stood out as all of them expanded at annual rates that were above 7%.",
        "However, the sector of financial services was the one that contributed the most to growth because of its greater weight in the GDP.",
        "In the first quarter, the GDP for industry grew 5.1%.",
        "The sectors of construction (due to public works projects), and electricity, gas and water were the only ones that showed annual contraction rates.",
        "For the second quarter of 2011, the economic activity indicators suggest that growth will be similar to that of the first.",
        "By type of expenditure, household consumption will probably show a momentum that is even better than what was seen in the first quarter according to what is suggested by: the consumer confidence index, which recovered after the slump in April and May; retail sales which showed an average growth in the months of April and May of 17%; the imports of consumer goods which had expanded an annual 35% in dollars as of May; and the growth of consumer credit which had a real annual rate of growth of 19%.",
        "Positive performance is also expected for investment in the second quarter.",
        "This can be inferred from the performance of imports of capital goods, which grew 59% on average in April and May.",
        "This investment has probably been supported by the strength of commercial credit in a context of low interest rates.",
        "As of June, the rates for ordinary and preferential loans were at 7.4% and 4.6% respectively.",
        "These numbers are lower than the averages since 1998 (11.8% and 7.5%).",
        "Likewise, in June, the commercial loan portfolio maintained an annual growth of around 19% at constant prices just as it in the previous two months.",
        "This performance is similar to that of the total portfolio.",
        "In the area of supply, the fact also stands out that even if the growth of industrial production in May (4.3%) turns out to be lower than expected, its trend is still positive.",
        "In construction, licenses showed a sharp rise in the months of April and May with an average annual growth rate of 86%.",
        "With respect to foreign trade, Colombian exports grew at an annual rate of 36% in dollars from the beginning of the year to May.",
        "The rise in exports is basically explained by the 48% growth of commodities (petroleum and its derivatives, nickel-iron, coal, coffee, gold, bananas and flowers).",
        "For the same period, the rest of the exports increased 6%.",
        "Total imports in dollars showed an annual change of 55%.",
        "The accumulated 12-month growth for total imports was 33.9%.",
        "The growth of the GDP in the first half of 2011 is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand and, to a lesser degree, by world demand.",
        "On the domestic front there should be an improvement in the performance of public consumption and in the investment in public works projects that will be added to a positive performance in private demand.",
        "In the foreign context, as long as the crisis in the developed countries does not get worse, no changes in the factors that affect the performance of economic activity are anticipated; high terms of trade, relatively positive growth for trading partners and abundant capital flows, especially in direct foreign investment.",
        "Thus the growth of the GDP for all of 2011 is expected to be within a range between 4.5% and 6.5% which is 50 bp higher than the range presented in the last Inflation Report Financial Variables Total credit in national (NC) and foreign currency (FC) continued rising.",
        "As of June, all of the types of credit, including not only households but also companies, registered growth that was much higher than the 2011 GDP estimate.",
        "This has occurred in a context of real interest rates that are historically low.",
        "As of June the real credit (NC and FC) rose 22.5% annually, data which is 20 bp higher than that registered in May.",
        "The consumer portfolio (NC and FC) registered an increase of 164 bp with respect to the previous month having reached 24.0% in June.",
        "The mortgage and commercial portfolio showed an annual variation of 16.7% and 22.4% slipping 24 and 42 bp respectively with respect to the data from the month of May.",
        "In June the real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial loans were at 14.9%, 9.7% and 7.4%.",
        "These numbers are lower than the averages seen since 1998 The External Context Since the last quarterly report, worldwide economic activity has deteriorated as the result of different shocks it has been hit by such as the rise in petroleum prices, the natural disaster in Japan and the deterioration in confidence associated with the debt problems in the United States and Europe.",
        "For the rest of the year and 2012, the developed economies are facing an outlook of limited growth.",
        "The rate of expansion will probably remain below its historical average as a consequence of the high levels of indebtedness and the growing financial costs.",
        "The need for fiscal adjustment in Europe and the United States will affect the performance of demand in those countries and could complicate the labor panorama even more.",
        "In contrast, the emerging countries will continue to grow at a positive pace.",
        "In the United States the economic activity indicators are showing mediocre performance and one that is lower than was expected three months ago.",
        "The labor and housing markets are still stagnant.",
        "In the Euro Zone, in turn, the differences between the countries with low levels of debt that are growing well, led by Germany, and the countries with high levels of debt that are virtually stagnant are becoming deeper.",
        "In the last few months, the problems with sustainability on the European periphery are getting worse.",
        "A recovery after the natural disaster in March is beginning to be seen in Japan.",
        "That shock affected other economies in Asia and probably the United States.",
        "Reestablishing the supply chain could help world growth.",
        "The recent dip in the prices for petroleum and of commodities is a collateral effect from the drop in the strength of the global economy.",
        "This price trend could have a positive effect on the purchasing capacity of consumers and reduce inflationary pressures.",
        "With respect to emerging economies, China has grown more than was predicted and its cut back is very slow.",
        "So far, the monetary policy squeeze has not had significant effects on economic activity.",
        "For other Asian countries (India, South Korea and Taiwan) there are indications of a slowdown in the second quarter but the pace of growth is still high.",
        "The economies in the region continue to expand at high rates.",
        "It is to be expected that with the reduction in inflationary pressures, the international interest rates will remain low.",
        "As a result, the high liquidity in developed countries together with the differential in return and the perception of low risk in Latin America will continue to stimulate capital flows to this region.",
        "With respect to the growth of Colombia’s trading partners, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the lower growth of the United States has been compensated for by a better performance in Latin America and especially in Ecuador, a country that has been surging (8.6% annually as of March, 2011).",
        "The forecast assumes a better rate of growth for the United States in the second half of the year and a moderate slowdown in China as a consequence of the restrictive posture of monetary policy.",
        "The board members focused on the following points: (i) the growth of the GDP in the first quarter, (ii) the international uncertainty due to the problems of public debt and banking systems in some of the industrialized countries, (iii) the bad indicators for economic activity of the United States, (iv) the historically low level of the Bank’s benchmark interest rate and of a large part of the real interest rates as well as their possible future effect on the soundness of the financial system if they are continued for an excessively prolonged period, (v) the constantly expanding growth of all of the credit components and of household debt, (vi) the historically high level of the terms of trade and its contribution to the growth of national revenue, (vii) the dynamic performance of private demand not only in consumption but also in investment in machinery and equipment, (viii) the better indicators in the labor market of a higher quality of employment, (ix) the high probability that the output level will be close to its potential in the second half of the year, (x) inflation expectations for the short and medium term that have corrected downward and are within the target range, (xi) the recent appreciation of the peso, (xii) the high international prices for petroleum and food in many countries as well as the increases in the policy interest rates in some of them, and (xiii) the importance for the economy of measures that will contribute to consolidating financial stability.",
        "Some members of the Board expressed their opinion that, in spite of the suitable trend seen in inflation and expectations for it, the Bank’s benchmark rate should be raised 25 bp for the following reasons: (i) the strength of the Colombian economy led particularly by household consumption and the strength of investment other than public works projects, (ii) the recent information related to economic activity on the side of both the supply and demand as well as consumer and industry expectations which indicate that the growth of the GDP in the second quarter could be similar to that registered at the beginning of the year.",
        "For the second half of the year, the technical team expects that economic activity will surge and because of that they raised their prediction for growth for this year and next to an interval of between 4.5% and 6.5%.",
        "In this they were partly influenced by the good terms of trade, (iii) the information available so far, including the data on GDP growth (5.1%), suggests that the output gap will close in the second half of the year, (iv) the growth of credit continues to climb.",
        "All of its components, not only that for businesses but also that for households show real rates of growth that are significantly higher than the increase in the GDP.",
        "This is occurring in a context in which a large part of the real interest rates is at historically low levels, (v) the fact that as of March, the prices of used housing continued to climb and were approaching their highest level seen since 1995.",
        "The indicator for new housing prices also rose in the first quarter, (vi) the current real rate is below its probable long term equilibrium and is inconsistent with the close to potential growth expected in 2011 and 2012 as well as a projected inflation that is near the midpoint of the long term target range, (vii) the consecutive and timely increases in the Bank’s interest rates which have contributed to keeping inflation within the target range and to reducing the risks of financial imbalances which would later lead to an unnecessary volatility in interest rates, output and employment.",
        "Another member of the Board thought that it would not be suitable to raise the Bank’s interest rates at this time since, as of June, the indicators for the total and core consumer inflation and inflation expectations for one, two, three and five years have been anchored to the target.",
        "The accumulated rise in the CPI is very similar to that for the same period in 2010.",
        "Inflation excluding food and regulated prices is very close to the floor of the target range.",
        "And the readjustments in wages have been compatible with it.",
        "The concentration of exports and of DFI in petroleum and mining continues to rise.",
        "Both came to 80% of the performance of the former and 85% of the latter even though they generated only 200,000 jobs.",
        "In contrast, industrial exports have stagnated.",
        "The monetary authority of our main trading partner, the United States under the pressure of stagnation, the fears of a double-dip recession and the persistent and high unemployment will undoubtedly not begin to raise its rates before 2013.",
        "Finally, he added that the sensitivity of domestic demand in view of the foreign conditions is much higher today through the capital account and its effects on liquidity and loans.",
        "Fortunately the expansion of demand has been, in large part, a counterpart to the capital inflows which have been creating obstacles to the transmission of the readjustments in the Bank’s rates to lending rates.",
        "Therefore, additional increases will attract larger inflows and credit supply which will slow down the transmission of the monetary policy even more.",
        "Thus, we could end up feeding what we want to control: inflation.",
        "Consequently, what is appropriate now is the adoption of macro-prudential regulation measures that are coordinated with the government The Board of Directors agreed by majority to raise the benchmark rate of the Banco de la Republica by 25 basis points which will put it at 4.5%.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation (especially the risks associated with the handling of the debt problems in a large number of the advanced economies), the inflation trend and projections, growth, the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota August 12, 2011",
        "A regular meeting of Banco de la República’s Board of Directors was held in the city of Bogotá on March 18, 2011.",
        "Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. César Vallejo Mr. Juan Pablo Zárate Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and decisions on monetary policy were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in February was 3.17% (0.60% for the months).",
        "This is 23 basis points (bp) less than in January.",
        "The decline compared to January was due to the variation in prices for food and regulated items.",
        "Annual food price inflation went from 4.8% in January to 4.4% in February, largely because of perishable foods.",
        "Annual inflation in regulated items declined from 7.0% in January to 6.3% in February, thanks to less of an annual change in the price of gasoline, which was not adjusted in February.",
        "Inflation in tradables, excluding food and regulated items, was even more negative in February.",
        "The annual difference in prices for non-tradable goods and services, excluding food and regulated items, rose slightly and was 3.42% in February, having been 3.37% in January.",
        "As to the core inflation indicators, their average in February remained stable at 2.5%.",
        "With an annual rate of 1.7%, the lowest indicator was still the CPI, excluding food and regulated items.",
        "On the other hand, the annual modification in producer prices (PPI) was 4.6% in February, which is more than in January (4.3%).",
        "In terms of the make-up of the PPI, the annual variation in its imported component increased.",
        "Banco de la República’s monthly expectation survey with data at February points to 3.5% inflation by the end of 2011, which is slightly less than what was anticipated in January (3.6%).",
        "In the case of expectations further out (five and 10 years ahead), which are based on government bonds, the decline was clearer, but these expectations are still over the ceiling of the long-term target range (2% - 4%) Growth Available figures for the end of 2010 suggest more of an increase in GDP growth during the final quarter of the year compared to third-quarter growth and to what was forecast previously by the Bank, in which case the Colombian economy would have expanded by nearly 4.2% for all of 2010.",
        "This better- than-expected performance is largely the result of the indicator for works and coffee production.",
        "The momentum in economic activity so far this year is akin to what it was at the end of 2010, with internal demand performing well in terms of both consumption and investment.",
        "As for consumption, consumer confidence rose in February, breaking the trend.",
        "Added to this is the continued expansion in consumer lending at high rates in January and February, the 12.3% annual increase in retail sales by January, and a job market that is showing signs of improvement.",
        "Therefore, it is still reasonable to expect good growth in private consumption during the first quarter of 2011.",
        "As for investment, imports of capital goods were up by quite a bit at the end of the year, suggesting this expenditure remains strong.",
        "By the same token, the sharp increase in building permits during November and the acceleration in cement sales during December point to an improvement in home construction at the start of 2011, along with added momentum in works.",
        "With regard to foreign trade, the annual variation in total exports in dollars at January came to 29.5%, largely due to the mining, energy and coffee sector, which posted an annual increase of 30%.",
        "The cumulative 12-month increase in total exports is 22.3%.",
        "At December, annual growth in total imports in dollars came to 39.8%.",
        "The cumulative 12-month increase in total imports was 27.3%.",
        "On the supply side, real indicators of industry’s expectations and confidence show this sector is still on the road to recovery.",
        "According to the DANE Monthly Manufacturing Sample, annual industrial growth was 6.2% by January 2011.",
        "This exceeds the cumulative rate for all of 2010 and is similar to what was reported by ANDI.",
        "Another source, Fedesarrollo, cites continued growth in the volume of industrial orders during January; however, it remains slow and a long ways from record highs.",
        "In contrast, the measure of inventory availability (counter-cyclical) is already near to its record low.",
        "Industrialists’ expectations for production at three months returned to a high level and the confidence indicator (which combines, orders, expectations and inventories) rose once again.",
        "For 2011, macroeconomic conditions continue to support an important economic growth.",
        "In fact, the expectation is still one of rising demand, high terms of trade, which will increase more than in 2010, important FDI flows, a continued recovery in jobs, and broad terms for internal lending, with relatively low real interest rates.",
        "Accordingly, GDP is expected to perform favorably in 2011, at around 4.5%.",
        "Nevertheless, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds this expectation, since the world faces a number of economic and political risks Financial Variables In February, nominal interest rates on consumer and ordinary lending averaged 17.5% and 9.8% respectively, with consumer lending up 4 bp and ordinary lending down by 27 bp, compared to the month before.",
        "The mortgage lending rate was 12.4%, which is 7 bp higher than in January.",
        "The annual increase in the total gross loan portfolio in domestic currency was 15.5% in February, as opposed to 14.9% the month before.",
        "The consumer and mortgage loan portfolios remain the most dynamic, posting respective annual variations of 20.9% and 17.5%.",
        "In February, the annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio came to 13.5%.",
        "Interest rates on one-year government bonds were up by 12 bp between February 25 and March 18, 2011; those on five-year government bonds declined by 23 bp during the same period.",
        "Interest on the 10-year bonds was 8.7% by the same date, which is 20bp less than the rate posted on February 25 The External Context An important factor in the external context is the impact the earthquake in Japan has had on that country’s economy and on international markets in general.",
        "For the past week, equity and commodity markets have registered major losses in market value.",
        "These have slowed the rise in international commodity prices, at least in part, and accentuated the stock market declines already witnessed due to the tensions in the Middle East and North Africa.",
        "Oil prices, in particular, fell after having risen sharply with the advent of the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa.",
        "Global growth continues at different speeds.",
        "On the one hand, in terms of the major developed countries, the United States and Germany have exhibited better than expected performance.",
        "On the other, there are the peripheral European economies and Japan, with low growth and even declines in some cases.",
        "Finally, there are the emerging economies that continue to grow at a good pace, bolstered by Asia and Latin America.",
        "So far in 2011, the United States has continued to consolidate its economic recovery with slow-moving growth in industrial manufacturing and stronger than expected momentum in sales to consumers.",
        "The job market also has begun to show signs of resurgence, as suggested by the January and February indicators.",
        "Even so, there are still obstacles to full recovery.",
        "First of all, high debt levels and persistently high risk perception have hampered a revival in lending.",
        "Secondly, the housing market continues to lag and the fiscal deficit is huge.",
        "These circumstances can limit growth in consumption and investment.",
        "The situation in the case of the Euro zone is less clear and shows different trends for its member states.",
        "Germany, on the one hand, has exhibited strong recovery, thanks to exports, and has managed to pull off a sizeable reduction in unemployment.",
        "On the other hand, growth in the peripheral European economies is less than promising and joblessness continues to be a major concern.",
        "Finally, with respect to Japan, economic activity prior to the earthquake showed no sign of performing well and this situation is likely to worsen in the months ahead.",
        "However, on a longer term basis, more dynamic growth can be expected as a result of reconstruction efforts.",
        "Despite recent declines in international prices for raw materials, they remain high and could pass through to inflation in both the developed and emerging economies.",
        "Moreover, there are still a number of factors bringing upward structural pressure to bear on raw material prices.",
        "Added to these pressures are the concerns about the safety of nuclear power and the restrictions on its use announced in some countries around the world.",
        "In the context of good global growth (propelled largely by the emerging economies) and high commodity prices, we can expect the central banks in the emerging economies and in some of the commodity-exporting developed countries to continue the cycle of interest rates hikes.",
        "In the major developed economies, despite a considerable amount of surplus installed capacity, international commodity prices have begun to pass through to inflation.",
        "For these reasons, one cannot rule out the possibility of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England raising their rates during the second quarter of 2011.",
        "In contrast, for the United States, no changes in monetary stance are anticipated for the short term.",
        "Finally, with regard to risk perception, credit default swaps for the peripheral European economies have increased again in recent weeks, and Moody’s downgraded the debt ratings of Spain and Portugal.",
        "Risk premiums for Latin America remain low and, in the case of Colombia, its foreign debt rating was raised to investment grade by Standard and Poor’s.",
        "The members of the Board of Directors weighed the possibility of raising intervention interest rates at this meeting, pursuant to what was announced at the previous meeting with regard to the advisability of gradually reducing the monetary stimulus of past months to make the added momentum in the Colombian economy sustainable over time and to keep inflation within the long-term target range.",
        "The following points, in particular, were emphasized: (i) interest rates at record low levels in nominal and real terms, with signs of stability during the past month; (ii) the risk extremely low interest rates for too long a period of time can ultimately imply for financial stability, the sustainability of growth and future inflation; (iii) further reasons to expect the economy to reach near potential levels during the second half of the year, given the continued high growth rate for consumer lending, a better job market, the sharp increase in building permits, and the added momentum in works; (iv) the inconsistency that could result from having an exceptionally low interest rate coupled with near-trend growth anticipated for 2011 and 2012, and inflation forecast at around the -point of the long-term target range; (v) the time it takes monetary policy to have an impact; (vi) over-target inflation expectations at more than one year; and (vii) the stability of the exchange rate in recent weeks and the positive outcome of the foreign currency purchase program.",
        "In terms of risks, it is still too early to gauge the full impact of the earthquake and the tsunami that struck Japan.",
        "An initial analysis indicates economic recovery in the developed countries could be slower, but this would not take pressure off oil and other commodity prices.",
        "In addition, doubts about the fiscal situation in some of the industrialized countries continue, as does uncertainty with respect to international oil prices, given the political instability in the Middle East and North Africa.",
        "Furthermore, international prices for oil, food and other commodities are at record highs and have led to prices increases for consumers in many countries.",
        "The central banks of some countries in Latin America and elsewhere have raised their interest rates.",
        "Considering all these factors and the time it takes monetary policy to affect aggregate spending and inflation, the Board felt it was appropriate and prudent to continue to gradually reduce the monetary stimulus.",
        "The level of Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate still supports short-term growth in output and employment.",
        "The intervention rate hikes in February and March will help to make the increase in output and employment more sustainable, to keep inflation within the target range this year and the next, and to preserve the stability of the financial system.",
        "Furthermore, these anticipated consequences of monetary policy are expected reduce the level to which the intervention interest rate should increase in relation to the levels observed in previous economic cycles The Board of Directors agreed to an increase of 25 basis points in Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate, placing it at 3.5%.",
        "OF THE OF THE OF OF DE LA REPÚBLICA HELD ON 30TH 2011 On 30[th] September 2011, the ordinary meeting of Banco de la República’s Board of Directors was held in the city of Bogota, attended by the Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, the General Manager Mr. José Dario Uribe, and the exclusive full-time dedicated directors, Messrs. Carlos Gustavo Cano, Juan Jose Echavarria, Fernando Tenjo, Juan Pablo Zarate, and Cesar Vallejo, at which inflation and economic growth, and the perspectives for both situations were discussed, and decisions relating to the monetary policy were adopted.",
        "The following is a summary of the major topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in August was 3.27% (-0.03% monthly), which means 15 basis points (bp) less than in July.",
        "This figure was lower than the projection of the Bank’s technical team and what was expected for the market’s average.",
        "For the year elapsed as of August, the CPI accumulated a 2.64% increase, this being a little higher than the one recorded in the same period of the previous year.",
        "Food prices recorded a favorable behavior in August, which was translated into decrease in the annual variation of the respective CPI down to 4.6% from the previous month’s 4.8%.",
        "Regarding inflation without foods, the result in August was 2.76% as compared with 2.90% in July.",
        "This decline was due to a decrease in the annual variation of the regulated and non-tradable basket without foods or regulated items.",
        "In the case of non-tradable without foods or regulated, a significant 40 bp was seen as compared with the July record.",
        "This fall is in great part related to the reversion of the June increase.",
        "Notwithstanding, even discarding this phenomenon, some decline in the non-tradable adjustment rate occurred.",
        "In the case of the regulated items basket, the price variation was 5.6% (7 bp less than in July).",
        "The variation of the annual regulated CPI has decreased gradually since March in the current year, due to the low adjustments, or even reductions, taking place in the electric energy charges.",
        "This may be added to fuel price adjustments, slightly lower than those observed last year.",
        "In the CPI without food, upward pressures came this time from the tradable without food or regulated.",
        "The annual indicator variation was placed in a positive terrain (0.12%) for the first time since the beginning of the previous year.",
        "Items such as automobiles, electro domestic appliances, and electronic and communication apparatuses, continued to show falls in their prices, but of less magnitude than in the past year.",
        "Likewise, other categories relating to house cleaning, hygiene and wardrobe have started showing some rises.",
        "This behavior is likely due to the fact that the cumulative appreciation of the peso gave way in the previous months.",
        "All basic inflation measurements showed reductions in August.",
        "For this reason, the growing trend exhibited by these indicators since the end of 2010 was interrupted.",
        "Inflation expectations measured through surveys not show important changes.",
        "They exhibit a result close to 3.2% for the end of the year and the next twelve months.",
        "On the other hand, the TES derivates at different terms continued to decrease and remained within the target range.",
        "The variation of the producer price index (PPI) experienced a recovery in August and was adjusted at an annual 5.2% rate versus 4.8% in July.",
        "Increases were concentrated in the imported component of the indicator Growth In the second quarter of 2011, the Colombian GDP grew at a 5.2% annual rate.",
        "Household consumption was the most contributing aggregate for GDP expansion in this period as mainly propelled by the purchases of durable and semi-durable goods.",
        "Investment in fixed capital was as well accelerated during this period with the highest expansion rate in four years, and a growth average higher than that the past decade’s.",
        "By components, the strong dynamism of investment in machinery and transportation equipment stands out.",
        "Construction has contributed negatively due to the fall of investment in works, not offset by the expansion in buildings.",
        "Simultaneously, in the second semester, a strong inventory accumulation was recorded, thus taking up to 21.1% the annual growth of total investment.",
        "Internal demand in the second quarter grew 9.1% per annum and it remains as the main support of Colombian economy’s growth.",
        "The annual growth rate of private demand was 11.7%.",
        "On the other hand, net exports contributed negatively to GDP growth.",
        "This was due to imports growing threefold over exports.",
        "On the supply side, annual growths higher than 7% recorded by the mining, commerce and transport sectors were highlighted.",
        "However, due to its heavier weight in GDP, the branch of financial and real estate services was the best contributor to GDP growth.",
        "The industry’s GDP grew 2.1% in annual terms, and contracted vis-à-vis the first quarter.",
        "The construction sector, due to the works fall, was the only one to register an annual backward movement.",
        "Total exports in dollars grew at a 55% annual rate.",
        "This increase was propelled by both higher prices and the amounts of crude oil and by-products produced and, in lesser degree, by exports of coal and some industrial products.",
        "As per exports of basic agricultural products (like coffee, bananas, and flowers), an annual 6.6% fall was recorded.",
        "In the case of industrial exports (without oil derivatives, ferronickel, gold and coffee) during the month of July, a recovery was seen in both prices (20% per annum) and amounts (20% per annum).",
        "Total imports in dollars showed an annual 33% variation in July.",
        "Major contributions to the annual growth of external purchases during July were concentrated in goods for industry, transport equipment, fuels, and non- durable consumption goods.",
        "Particularly, annual growth for consumption goods imports was 21%, for intermediate goods was 29%, and for capital goods was 46%.",
        "With respect to the third quarter of 2011, most activity indicators available suggest that the economy would have maintained a good performance.",
        "By type of expenditure, growth in the third quarter would have continued to be propelled by household consumption as inferred from the behavior of consumer’s trust, consumption credit as of August, and the good dynamism of consumer goods imports as well as of retail sales as of July continuing to show a positive trend.",
        "The recent evolution of the labor market would also support the favorable dynamics of private consumption.",
        "In the moving quarter as of July, the higher growth of the occupation rate with respect to global participation allowed the unemployment rate to keep its decreasing tendency.",
        "Notwithstanding employment creation being more concentrated on non- salaried than salaried workers, underemployment continued to decrease with no apparent deterioration of employment quality, for this reason.",
        "The labor market is expected to persist on behaving favorably during the rest of the year.",
        "On the supply side, some variables associated with the manufacturing industry such as the DANE’ industrial production index as well as the Fedesarrollo’s orders indicator (both as of July), and the sector’s energy demand (as of August) suggest a relative stagnation of the productive activity.",
        "However, predicting sector’s deterioration is still premature if we consider that the indicator of the industrialists’ expectations on their three-month production has been kept at considerably high levels.",
        "Other sectoral indicators suggest that commerce, construction, mining, and services shall be the activities that will contribute most to GDP growth in the third quarter.",
        "Hence, the expansion rhythm of the third quarter is likely to be higher than the second quarter’s.",
        "Based on the above, it is probable for economy to accelerate its growth.",
        "In addition, it is feasible that the Colombian economy will not be hit in an important manner by the less favorable international conjuncture in the third quarter.",
        "Towards the fourth quarter, an adverse effect on internal economy may be seen if the deterioration of the external situation is confirmed.",
        "Under the presupposition that the fourth quarter may not growth with respect to the third, the full year’s GDP would grow about 5.2%, this figure being within the (4.5 to 6.5%) prediction range set forth in the June quarterly report Financial variables Total credit in national currency [“moneda nacional”] (MN) and foreign currency [“moneda extranjera”] (ME) was stabilized at high growth rates.",
        "As of August, all credit modalities, for households and enterprises, are recording growths extremely higher than the 2011 estimated GDP growth.",
        "This has taken place in a context of historically low real interest rates.",
        "In July and August, (MN and ME) bank credit was stabilized at an average growth rate of 23.2% per annum.",
        "Likewise, by portfolio modalities in these two months, the average annual growth was: 2.5% for consumption, 23.1 for commercial, and 17.3% for mortgage portfolios.",
        "In July, the real interest rates (with the exception of GDP without food) for consumer, mortgage and ordinary commercial credits were placed at 15.5%, 10.0% and 8.0%, this figures being lower than the averages seen since 1998.",
        "With respect to portfolio, the annual growth rates are sustained by indebtedness in pesos, since annual growth in foreign currency is decreasing because the balance since May has been maintained around US$ 6,850 billion [in US figure representation], 6,850 million [in English and European figure representation] External context In the few past weeks, the international context has continued to deteriorate.",
        "Fears relating to the sovereign debt problems in Europe are increasing, and growth forecasts for the United States and Europe in 2012 have been revised downwards.",
        "Considerable volatility and strong losses in the equity markets have been associated, in large part, with high uncertainty about the fiscal situation of some developed economies; markets are more and more skeptic with respect to the abilities of those affected by fiscal problems to stabilize their public debt.",
        "In the Eurozone case, doubts were increasing about the solvency of some commercial banks in the region having high investments in sovereign bonds of countries with fiscal problems.",
        "In fact, during the last two months, signs indicating a likely increase in developed economies’ liquidity emerged, particularly in Europe.",
        "In this continent, the differential between the Libor and the interbank rates continues to rise.",
        "In addition, restrictions are being seen for the -term founding, likely to limit the granting of credit.",
        "The risk perception with respect to the banking business in these economies is increasing again and reaching the 2008 and 2009 levels.",
        "The most recent announcements and measures introduced by governments and economic authorities in these countries to confront the fiscal problems have not been effective to enhance agents’ confidence.",
        "Global securities/stock markets have experienced drastic falls not limited to bank actions only.",
        "The absence of decisions addressing the problem of the sovereign debt in Europe imposes more and more serious risks on the international financial stability.",
        "Adding to the above is fiscal uncertainty in the United States, for lack of agreement between the political parties on the necessary measures required to reach a sustainable debt.",
        "Face to this general overlook, the recovery of internal demand in developed economies may get even more complicated as, in fact, some real activity indicators in both Europe and the United States already suggest.",
        "In the Eurozone, a contraction of the manufacturing activity was observed.",
        "In Germany and France, the two growth engines in the region, a deceleration of exports has been witnessed.",
        "And this has been the most dynamic demand component in the past two years.",
        "The labor market is neither showing recovery signs, this making a very weak consumption foreseeable for the third quarter of the year.",
        "In the European periphery economies, fiscal adjustment programs will continue to depress the internal demand’s recovery perspectives in the short term.",
        "In this manner, growth forecasts for the Eurozone are diminishing.",
        "For instance, for 2011 and 2012 they were reduced by the IMF from 2.0% and 1.7% to 1.6% and 1.1% In the United States, during the past two months, several indicators of real activity have deteriorated.",
        "Since April, both personal consumption like retail sales show very little growth, this being in part explained by the conditions of the labor market and consumers’ impaired confidence.",
        "The high levels of household indebtedness have not been significantly reduced, this fact being a negative factor in the reactivation of their internal demand.",
        "Moreover, the deterioration of the economic and financial situation in Europe, as well as its effects likely to affect world demand, may limit its exports Hence, the IMF reducing growth forecast for 2011 and 2012 from 2.5% and 7% to 1.6%, and 1.9% respectively.",
        "All the projections of analysts consulted by the technical team were as well revised downwards.",
        "In the emerging economies, some moderation has occurred in the observed and expected growth.",
        "This can be explained in part by more restrictive monetary policies, the elimination of fiscal incentives, and the world demand deceleration.",
        "Particularly, markets are closely following China and India where some indicators point out at some deceleration, and Brazil where this trend is more evident.",
        "As per basic product prices, industrial activity deceleration worldwide has slowed down the demand for these goods in such a way, that in the past few weeks a decrease has been seen in the international quotation of prices for some, particularly oil, copper and coal.",
        "The prices of other basic products of agricultural origin such as cereals and oils, suspended their upward rend and got stabilized at high levels.",
        "Turbulence in the international financial markets is beginning to be strongly felt in Latin America, especially in the exchange and the security/stock marketplaces.",
        "Risk premiums in the region countries are increasing and currencies have been depreciated against the US dollar, in this way attaining levels unseen since the end of 2009.",
        "Likely, if the situation in the United States and Europe gets complicated, growth in the region’s countries may be negatively affected trough different channels.",
        "One of them would by the loss of confidence, this being a variable having played an important role in the previous crisis.",
        "Another channel would be the lessened national income, since a depressed external demand may generate addition decreases in the prices of basic goods, as well as falls in exports and high volatility in capital flows.",
        "Nevertheless, the major Latin American economies may have a larger space than developed economies to cushion a likely fall by means of (fiscal and monetary) counter- cycle policies.",
        "Growth predictions in emerging economies have began to diminish, but in a less pronounced manner than those of the developed economies.",
        "In the case of China, the IMF revised its forecasts for 2011 from 9.6% to 9.5%, and for 2012 from 9.5% to 9%.",
        "Anyway, emerging economies are expected to continue to foster world growth; and, among other reasons, because household consumption in these countries will be more dynamic than in the developed economies AND The Board members highlighted the following issues: i) the growing uncertainty at the international financial markets; ii) GDP growth in the second quarter; iii) the dynamic performance of the internal demand, as reflected on both consumption increase and private investment; iv) the best indicators of employment quality in the labor market; v) the stabilization of the credit growth rate at high levels for both homes and enterprises; vi) the context of low real interest rates that, even having become higher, they show lower levels than their historical averages, and their likely future effect on the economy’s risk taking if they are kept for an excessive prolonged period: vii) the high level of exchange terms, despite the fall of some prices for exports, like oil; viii) the annual August inflation decreasing more than foreseen (3.27%), particularly for the non-tradable and regulated prices behavior.",
        "On its side, the average of basic inflation measurements are within the target range (3% +/- 1 percentage point); ix) the different-term basic inflation expectations being reduced, and inflation projections maintained at the end of 2011 and 2012; x) other countries’ monetary policy, and xi) the exchange rate behavior.",
        "The Board of Directors of Banco de la República has decided to keep the intervention interest rate unaltered at 4.5%, based on the following main considerations: The international context has deteriorated in the weeks subsequent to the past meeting of the Board.",
        "Fears regarding the sovereign debt have been growing, and growth predictions in the United States and Europe in 2011 and 20012 have been revised downward.",
        "In certain Asian and Latin American economies, the new information points out to some moderation in growth.",
        "Although International prizes for basic products have gone down, they still remain at high levels.",
        "Besides the volatility of financial markets has increased.",
        "As for Colombia, it was highlighted that : (i) data for the first semester showed economic activity expanding at a good (5%) rhythm similar to that previously projected.",
        "Growth has been propelled by the strong dynamism of internal demand, particularly from the private sector with an annual rate of 11.7% in the second quarter.",
        "For the third quarter, the new information currently available suggests that growth may be higher than recorded in the first semester.",
        "Thus, the probability of the growth-prediction range (between 4.5% - 6.5%) for 2011 is still high.",
        "(ii) The annual growth of bank credit became stabilized at a high rate in an environment of real interest rates on loans that, in spite of their increases, are still below their historical averages.",
        "Consumption remains being the most dynamic portfolio, with increases almost threefold the nominal GDP growth estimated for 2011; and (iii) the new housing price index continued to increase and reached in July the maximum record of the series, as calculated since 1997.",
        "In this context, the risk balance was not substantially modified vis-à-vis the previous month.",
        "While external factors were reflecting more risks and uncertainty, Colombian economy is maintaining a strong dynamics.",
        "The Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to keep the intervention interest rate unaltered at 4.5%.",
        "Likewise, it considers that the current level keeps the rate in a good position to answer to the new information regarding global and national economy.",
        "The Board will continue to carefully monitor the international situation, together with inflation behavior and forecasts, growth, active markets behavior, and it reiterates that future monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogotá , October 14 2011.",
        "Minutes of the Banco de la Republica Board of Director’s meeting on August 19, 2011 On August 19, 2011, the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica was held in the city of Bogota.",
        "Present were: Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of the Treasury and Public Credit Jose Dario Uribe, the General Director Full-time Board members present: Carlos Gustavo Cano Juan Jose Echavarria Fernando Tenjo Juan Pablo Zarate and Cesar Vallejo The inflationary and economic growth situations as well as the outlook for both were discussed and decisions were made with respect to monetary policy.",
        "Below is a summary of the main topics dealt with in this meeting Annual consumer inflation in July was 3.42% (monthly was 0.14%), which was 19 basis points (bp) higher than in June.",
        "This number was in line with what was projected by the Bank’s technical team and similar to what the market expected on average.",
        "The main upward pressures came from the prices for perishable food.",
        "Larger increases in the prices of some vegetables and fruit were seen and are explained by the lagged effect of the recent La Niña weather condition on this group of food items.",
        "As of July, the annual change in food prices was 4.8%.",
        "Inflation excluding food remained stable (2.9%).",
        "In this basket, there were no unexpected changes and the variations in the different groups compensated for each other.",
        "The tradables (-0.02%) showed a less negative change (compared to - 0.13% in June) and this was the component that exercised the most upward pressure on the CPI excluding food (due to household items and cell phones).",
        "The change in prices of non-tradables remained at the same level as in June (3.8%).",
        "In spite of the stability of last month, this group has been demonstrating an upward trend since March mainly due to the performance of rent.",
        "In July the rise in rent prices (6 bp with respect to the level in June) was offset by the decline in the prices for other items that this basket is made up of.",
        "The regulated prices (5.7%), in turn, registered a 26 bp drop in July mainly because of the decrease in the annual variation of the CPI for fuel which offset the rise in prices for electricity.",
        "The measurements of core inflation (with the exception of inflation excluding food) continued their rising trend.",
        "This slow but continuous trend has been common to all of the measurements of core inflation since -2010.",
        "Thus, the average of the four published measurements has already surpassed the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The different measurements of inflation expectations (market expectations and expectations calculated based on public debt securities) were within the long term target range (from 2% to 4%).",
        "The variation in producer prices (PPI) showed a slight recovery in July and adjusted to an annual rate of 4.8% compared to 4.7% in June.",
        "The rises were concentrated in the import component of the indicator Growth The available activity indicators for the second quarter confirm that the Colombian economy has maintained a positive rate of growth for that period.",
        "Just as in the first three months of 2011 the growth in the second quarter was driven by domestic demand, especially household consumption.",
        "In the second quarter, private consumption was still favored by the improvements in the labor market.",
        "During the period, the rate of unemployment continued to fall and for the 13 areas it was at 11.5%.",
        "This decline was accompanied by an increase in the TGP for the second consecutive month.",
        "The preceding was more than offset by the rise in the employment rate and because of that the unemployment rate dropped.",
        "Imports also confirmed the strength of domestic demand in the second quarter.",
        "Purchases abroad in dollars grew 46% annually in June driven by the purchases of capital goods (58%) and raw materials (45%).",
        "Imports of consumer goods, in turn, grew 31% annually.",
        "With respect to exports, the new results showed an upsurge in foreign sales in dollars.",
        "In June, exports in dollars grew 54% annually, a figure that is higher than the one registered in May (34%).",
        "This increase was due to higher sales of commodities from mining (crude oil and its derivatives, coal, gold and nickel-iron) that contributed 82% of the total growth.",
        "With respect to the productive sectors, the indicators announced by ANDI and Fedesarrollo suggest that the industrial sector maintained the dynamism seen in the first quarter.",
        "The production measured by ANDI registered an annual expansion of 6.4% for the year as of June.",
        "Fedesarrollo’s supply and demand indicators showed a small setback in June but remained at favorable levels.",
        "Fedesarrollo’s 3-month production expectations indicator stayed at high levels.",
        "With respect to construction, cement production saw a growth of 17% annually during the second quarter.",
        "The strong trend in building permits from the beginning of the year to May also indicates a positive performance in construction activity in the coming months.",
        "The new information that is available for the second quarter is consistent with the forecast of 4.2% to 5.6% annual GDP growth for that period.",
        "The limited information available suggests that the annual growth in the third quarter will be above what had been estimated in the first half of the year.",
        "This is what is shown by the consumer confidence indicators, indicators of credit set aside for families and businesses and indicators of total demand for electricity.",
        "To conclude, if the situation abroad does not deteriorate abruptly, the growth for all of 2011 will be within the projected range (between 4.5% and 6.5%) Financial Variables Total loans continued to surge.",
        "As of July, all of the types of credit including both those for households and those for businesses registered growth that was well above the growth estimated for the GDP in 2011.",
        "Specifically, the annual growth was 24.8% for the consumer loan portfolio, 22.9% for the commercial portfolio and 17.4% for mortgages.",
        "Following the same order, these levels are 78 bp, 53 bp and 67 bp higher than last month.",
        "The above has occurred in a context of real interest rates that are historically low.",
        "In July, the real interest rates (discounting the CPI excluding food) was at 15.1% for consumer loans, 9.9% for mortgage loans and 7.5% for ordinary commercial loans.",
        "These figures are lower than the averages seen since 1998.",
        "As of July, banking credit (NC and FN) rose 23.2% annually, a number that is 63 bp higher than what was registered in June Foreign Context In the last few weeks, the probability of a deterioration in the global economy has risen significantly as a result of the economic problems that are currently affecting the developed economies.",
        "These problems have worsened due to the slow economic growth, the high public indebtedness, the markets’ loss of confidence and the stagnation in macroeconomic policy in those economies.",
        "This has called into question the viability of the recovery of advanced countries thus indirectly complicating the economic panorama for emerging countries.",
        "The recently revealed figures on the performance of the United States in the second quarter the year were discouraging.",
        "The annualized quarterly growth between March and June, 2011 was 1.3% below what the market had expected (2.3%) and lower than not only the growth in the same quarter of last year (3.8%) but also the growth for all of 2011 (3%).",
        "The sluggish growth in the second quarter is partly due to a relapse in personal consumption which, after reaching a growth of 2.0% in 2010, has been falling since the beginning of this year to the point where the growth in the second quarter was practically zero.",
        "At the same time government expenditures have been shrinking in the last three quarters and accentuating the tightening of domestic demand.",
        "The only components of demand that have shown any strength are exports, which have been stimulated by the depreciation of the dollar, and non-residential fixed investment in response to the low interest rates.",
        "However, the better performance of these items has not been sufficient to offset the drop in the rest of the components of demand.",
        "The economic panorama in the Euro Zone is equally worrying.",
        "Between the first and second quarters of 2011, its economic growth fell from an already low level of 0.8% to 0.2% which, in practice indicates a totally stagnant economy.",
        "The slowdown was significant in almost all of the countries.",
        "Germany, for example, which grew 1.3% in the first quarter, grew only 0.1% in the second.",
        "Something similar occurred in France, which saw its growth slump from 0.9% to 0% during the same period.",
        "In the case of the United Kingdom, the news is no better.",
        "From a poor growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, it went to a growth that was barely 0.2% between this past March and June.",
        "In addition, the countries on the periphery of the Euro Zone –Greece, Portugal and Spain– remained stagnant or were shrinking.",
        "The combination of slow growth and high public debt in the developed countries raises doubts about the sustainability of the latter.",
        "This is explained by the extremely complex vicious cycle that some of these countries have fallen into.",
        "In this cycle the high indebtedness does not allow the economy to grow and the fact that it is not growing does not allow the debt to be paid.",
        "Under those conditions, the danger that the debt will be unsustainable rises and this is reflected in an increase in real volatility, greater financial fragility and a loss of economic strength.",
        "The financial markets have seen this danger clearly which explains the stock markets’ sharp plunges in the last few weeks and the steep rise in risk premiums, primarily in the countries on the periphery of the Euro Zone.",
        "Under these conditions, the outlook for the worldwide economy is becoming more and more uncertain.",
        "The markets are beginning to fear a double dip recession that will cause all of the progress that has been made through the slow recovery that started in the second half of 2009 to be lost.",
        "This pessimism is not unfounded.",
        "The slowdown in the advanced economies and the negative effect that this represents for the expansion of emerging economies has begun to undermine consumer and businessmen’s confidence who react by restricting their plans for consumption and investment.",
        "This weakens demand and with it the possibility of recovery.",
        "This situation is particularly obvious in the case of the US where the consumer confidence indicator calculated by the University of Michigan has fallen over the last few months to the same level that was seen between the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009.",
        "This has led to a stagnation of personal consumption as has already been stated.",
        "In addition, the high unemployment registered in the United States and in some European countries such as Spain and Greece is another factor that depresses confidence, consumption and demand thus creating a vicious cycle that accentuates the shrinkage of economic activity.",
        "This uncertainty becomes accentuated in view of the doubts about the ability of the governments in advanced economies to be able to carry out sufficiently effective counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies that could reverse the negative trends and restore the confidence of the markets.",
        "It can be seen that in several of these economies the response capacity has not just fallen drastically but that it is exhausted.",
        "In the case of the US, the government’s high indebtedness, which is closing in on 100% of the GDP, the size of the fiscal debt which has reached 10% of the GDP, and the restrictions that the debt ceiling imposes does not leave space for fiscal policy to play an active role like it during the crisis in 2009.",
        "The monetary policy in that country is also restricted by the zero limit on the interest rate although a third quantitative easing could still be carried out.",
        "Nevertheless, the risk of greater inflationary pressure that have been registered in that economy in the last few months could impede a quantitative easing that would be as strong as the ones that were produced to dodge the previous crisis.",
        "In the case of the European countries, the same thing has happened due to the complication which is implied by the management of an economy that includes a variety of countries where some of them have reached the point where their public debt is unsustainable and others are exposed to this contagion which could put them in the same situation.",
        "Meanwhile, the emerging economies are still the engine of worldwide growth although they are not free from risk.",
        "In a globalized economy, there are multiple channels for contagion as the experience from the crisis in 2009 demonstrated.",
        "One of them is the prices of commodities.",
        "So far we have seen that the price for petroleum has begun to decline and this will undoubtedly affect the oil-exporting countries including Colombia.",
        "The prices of other commodities such as grain and oil have not fallen yet although the rising trend that they showed in 2010 has been interrupted which is a symptom of the weakening of dlobal demand.",
        "Another channel of contagion is that of confidence which acts much more rapidly as the fall in the stock markets in emerging markets has shown as they duplicated what happened in the developed economies.",
        "In an environment of higher uncertainty, the emerging economies in Asia and Latin America have begun to lose strength although the majority are still growing at high rates.",
        "The question is to what point this growth can be sustained if the markets in the advanced economies –which absorb most of the exports of emerging countries– continue to weaken AND The board members focused on the following points: i) the growth of uncertainty in international financial markets, ii) the growth of the GDP in the second quarter, iii) the strong performance of domestic demand which is reflected both in the increase in consumption and in private investment, iv) the better indicators of quality employment in the labor market, v) the upsurge in loans to households and businesses in a context of real interest rates that have risen but that are at levels that are lower than their historical averages, vi) the historically low level of the Bank’s benchmark interest rate and of most of the real interest rates and their possible future effect on risk-taking in the economy if they are maintained for an excessively prolonged period, vii) the high level of the terms of trade and their contribution to the growth of national revenue, viii) annual inflation iin July rose for the third consecutive month (3.42%) especially due to the performance of food prices.",
        "The average of the measurements of core inflation, in turn, started rising again and surpassed the midpoint of the target range (3% +/-1 percentage point), ix) inflation expectations for different maturities and the inflation projections for the end of 2011 and 2012 are within the target range, x) the high probability that the output level will be close to its potential in the second half of the year, xi) the monetary policy of other countries, xii) the drop in international prices for petroleum, xiii) the performance of the exchange rate.",
        "The Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.5% mainly considering the following: i) since the last meeting, the series of events on the extenal front has raised the uncertainty with respect to the global economy.",
        "The plunge in the stock markets partly started by the drop in the credit rating of the US debt and the fiscal difficulties of some countries in the Euro Zone was added to a lower growth in the second quarter for the main developed economies ( United States, Germany, France, Japan).",
        "In Asia and Latin America, regions that are very strong, growth has slowed down due to supply factors or because of policy actions directed towards preventing an overheating of their economies.",
        "As a consequence, the risks of lower growth in the world economy have risen, and ii) the problems of sovereign debt in Europe and the debate about the debt ceiling in the United States sharply increased uncertainty and volatility in the international financial markets.",
        "In contrast, the international context is still very recent and their consequences are still difficult to set.",
        "Even if it is clear that the worldwide slowdown will have a negative impact on income and the country’s external demand there is a lot of uncertainty about its size and duration.",
        "However, the board emphasized that i) the available indicators of economic activity confirm that the Colombian economy is maintaining a positive rate of growth driven mainly by the strength household consumption, ii) the indicator of consumer and industry confidence remain at high levels and iii) loans to companies and families continue to rise with increases that are much higher than the increase in the nominal GDP estimated for this year.",
        "This is in a context of real loan rates that are below their historical averages.",
        "On balance the Board thought it would be prudent to suspend the increases in the interest rates especially due to the high uncertainty in the international financial markets and their potential negative effect on the growth of the global economy in general and the Colombian one in particular The Board of Directors unanimously agreed to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.5%.",
        "The Board will continue to monitor the international situation (especially the risks associated with the handling of the debt problems in a large number of the advanced economies), the inflation trend and projections, growth, the performance of the asset markets carefully and reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the new information available.",
        "Bogota , September 2, 2011",
        "A regular meeting of Banco de la República’s Board of Directors was held in the city of Bogotá on May 30, 2011.",
        "Mr. Juan Carlos Echeverry, Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mr. José Darío Uribe, Governor, Banco de la República Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. Cesar Vallejo The situation with respect to inflation and economic growth was discussed, as were their prospects for the future, and decisions on monetary policy were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed at the meeting Annual consumer inflation in April was 2.84% (0.12% for the month), which is 35 basis points (bp) less than in March.",
        "Downward pressure was exerted by the annual change in regulated prices, with 6.4% inflation in April compared to 6.9% in March.",
        "Food also was a factor in this respect, with 2.8% inflation in April as opposed to 3.9% in March.",
        "In the case of the latter, less inflation was due primarily to fuel and public utilities, while the reduced pressure from food originated primarily with perishables and, to a lesser extent, with processed foods.",
        "In contrast, upward pressure was brought to bear by the annual variation in prices for non- tradables and tradables without food and regulated prices.",
        "Respectively, these variations were 3.45% and -0.06% in April compared to 3.4% and -0.17% in March.",
        "As for the annual core inflation indicators, their average remained stable in April compared to what it was in March.",
        "At 1.9%, the CPI excluding food and regulated items was still the lowest indicator.",
        "The change in producer prices (PPI) was 4.7% by April, which is less than the variation posted in March (4.9%).",
        "In terms of its composition, the imported component was primarily responsible for the reduced rate of inflation.",
        "Banco de la República’s monthly expectation survey, with data at April, suggests inflation would be 3.1% by the end of 2011.",
        "This is less than what was anticipated last month (3.3%).",
        "In the case of longer term expectations (at five years), which are based on government bonds, the reduction was clearer and expectations are within the target range Growth The various real indicators on hand for the first quarter of the year show economic activity remained dynamic.",
        "This positive performance would be supported by an important increase in internal demand, but also by good export performance.",
        "Household consumption maintains a significant degree of momentum, judging by the positive way retail sales performed.",
        "They were up by an annual rate of 14.6% at March.",
        "This demand has continued to fuel largely by spending on durables, as is evident from the strong growth in vehicle sales and imports of consumer durables.",
        "This has been possible thanks to improving job-market conditions, particularly with respect to the quality of employment, and other factors.",
        "For example interest rates for consumers are still historically low, and consumer lending is growing at high rates (20.5% average nominal rate for April), with a tendency to accelerate.",
        "During the first quarter, transport machinery and equipment, as a component of applications for imports of capital goods, suggested good performance.",
        "Investment in construction, both buildings and works, also is expected to grow considerably, as indicated by cement sales and building permits for March.",
        "Added to these indicators are low commercial interest rates, which would support an expansion in investment during the remainder of the year.",
        "With respect to external demand, the results on hand for March, in dollars, point to good export performance, even better than expected.",
        "This applies not only to sales of commodities, but also to manufactured goods.",
        "A look at the different destinations shows March witnessed an important increase in industrial sales to the countries in the region.",
        "Those to the United States experienced a recovery in level, even though annual growth remained negative.",
        "At the same time, imports continued to post a high rate of growth by March.",
        "Accordingly, a positive contribution to growth from net external demand still is not expected.",
        "On the supply side, industrial production had increased by March at an annual rate of 5.2%.",
        "Vehicles, non-metallic minerals and petroleum refining were the most dynamic sectors, while iron and steel production fell again, due to the temporary shutdown of operations at Cerro Matoso for repairs.",
        "With the March data, growth in industry accelerated during the first quarter compared to the end of last year.",
        "Its expansion coincides with that of other indicators associated with the sector; namely, orders and inventories (Fedesarrollo), commercial lending, and the demand for unregulated energy.",
        "The figures on hand for the second quarter are scarce.",
        "The most relevant one is the Fedesarrollo consumer confidence indicator, which fell considerably in April and is below its historic average.",
        "Nevertheless, these results may be influenced by winter weather, among other phenomena Financial Variables In April, average nominal interest rates on consumer and ordinary lending were 17.5% and 10.1% respectively, with a 10 bp drop in consumer lending and a 7 bp increase in ordinary lending compared to the month before.",
        "The mortgage lending rate was 12.5%, which is 7 bp less than in March.",
        "Average nominal annual growth in the total gross loan portfolio in domestic currency came to 17.7% in April, having been 16% the previous month.",
        "The consumer and mortgage loan portfolios were still the most dynamic, posting respective average nominal annual variations of 20.5% and 18.8%.",
        "In April, the average nominal annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio stood at 15.6%.",
        "During May, interest rates on one-year government bonds were up by 9 bp, while those on five and ten-year bonds declined by 20 bp and 31 bp, respectively The External Context The most important news on the external front came from the developed world.",
        "The economic recovery in the United States is less vigorous than anticipated.",
        "At the same time, the financial difficulties in the European periphery continue to worsen.",
        "Added to this complex panorama for the developed countries is the build-up in inflationary pressures, particularly within the Euro zone.",
        "The emerging economies, on the other hand, continue to experience high growth rates, coupled with inflationary pressures that have led the central banks to change the stance of their monetary policy.",
        "The United States economy grew less in the first quarter of this year than in the final quarter of 2010.",
        "The slowdown was due to the cutback in government spending and the rainy weather at the start of the year.",
        "The pace of growth in household consumption was affected by the rise in energy prices, and the leading indicators at hand show no rebound in industrial and real estate activity during the second quarter.",
        "In contrast, although the figures for the job market indicate it remains loose, the reduction for the second straight week in applications for unemployment benefits may foretell an improvement in the employment situation.",
        "Once again, the data on first-quarter growth in the Euro zone showed a contrast between the performances of two groups of countries.",
        "While Germany and France report good growth, the peripheral European countries exhibit no clear signs of recovery.",
        "Portugal rounded out two quarters of decline in a row, and Spain continued to grow at rates barely above zero.",
        "Risk perception in the peripheral European economies continued to rise.",
        "Interest rates on Greece’s government bonds remain at record highs and fears about its sustainability are escalating.",
        "New fiscal adjustment measures are expected, particularly in Greece and Portugal.",
        "There is an upward trend in inflation in the developed countries.",
        "This is especially the case in the Euro Zone, where inflationary pressures have begun to pass through to core inflation.",
        "Even so, intervention interest rates in the United State are not yet expected to increase.",
        "However, the situation in the Euro zone is less clear.",
        "In April, the ECB raised the rate to curb inflationary pressures and, in May, it decided to leave it unchanged so as not to jeopardize the peripheral European economies.",
        "The emerging economies still are experiencing high growth rates.",
        "This, in turn, has reinforced the inflationary pressures in those countries.",
        "In the case of Latin America, inflation in Brazil and Peru continues to rise.",
        "In recent weeks, oil and other raw material prices have posted declines associated with uncertainty about the performance of the developed countries and an increase in inventories.",
        "No additional falling off is anticipated in the coming months, although more volatility is expected AND The members of the Board of Directors weighted the possibility of raising intervention interest rates at this meeting, as part of the continuing effort to gradually undo the monetary stimulus.",
        "The following points were emphasized: (i) Interest rates are at record low levels in nominal and real terms.",
        "(ii) All the lending components continue to grow at significant rates and there has been a build-up in household debt as well.",
        "(iii) The new information suggests the rate of expansion in economic activity between January and March could be in the upper part of the forecast range (3.9% to 5.5%).",
        "(iv) Terms of trade continue to improve and have reached record high levels, contributing to the growth in national income.",
        "(v) Consumption continues to perform positively, and investment in machinery and equipment remains dynamic.",
        "The same is expected to be the case with works.",
        "(vi) The indicators of quality employment in the job market have improved.",
        "(vii) There is an increased likelihood of output being close to its potential.",
        "(viii) Inflation expectations for the short and -term have adjusted downward and are within the target range.",
        "(ix) Recent appreciation of the peso.",
        "The following was noted with respect to risk: (i) Despite some reductions, international oil prices are expected to remain high.",
        "(ii) High international food prices continue to pose an international inflation risk.",
        "(iii) Inflationary pressures persist in many countries, as do interest rate hikes by some central banks in Latin America and Asia.",
        "(iv) Particularly low real interest rates for an excessively long period of time ultimately can pose a risk to financial stability.",
        "Moreover, the rate may be inconsistent with the near potential growth expected in 2011 and 2012 and a forecast for inflation near the -point of the long-term target range.",
        "Considering all these factors and the time it takes monetary policy to have an impact on aggregate spending and inflation, the Board of Directors felt the move towards a less expansive monetary policy must continue.",
        "The new level of Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate still supports short-term growth in output and employment.",
        "The intervention rate hikes will assist in keeping inflation within the target range for this year and the next, and will help to avoid financial imbalances in the future.",
        "Likewise, the anticipated monetary-policy actions, coupled with an austere fiscal stance, should reduce the extent to which the intervention interest rate would have to be raised in relation to the levels witnessed in past economic cycles The Board of Directors agreed to raise Banco de la República’s intervention interest rate by 25 basis points, placing it a 4.0%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República was held in the city of Bogotá on January 31, 2011.",
        "Full-time Board Members in Attendance: Mr. Carlos Gustavo Cano Mr. Juan José Echavarría Mr. Fernando Tenjo Mr. César Vallejo Mr. Juan Pablo Zárate Inflation and the economic situation were discussed with respect to growth and prospects for the future, and monetary-policy decisions were reached.",
        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed during the meeting Annual consumer inflation in December was 3.17% (0.65% for the month), which is 58 basis points (bp) more than in November and within the target range set by the Board of Directors for 2010 (2% - 4%).",
        "The rise in inflation compared to November was due to upward pressure from food and regulated prices, as well as less favorable performance by tradables, excluding food and regulated items.",
        "The annual variation in food prices went from 2.4% in November to 4.1% in December, propelled by both perishables and processed foods.",
        "The annual variation in regulated items went from 6.3% in November to 6.6% in December, and was concentrated in fuels.",
        "Lastly, the annual variation in prices for tradable goods, excluding food and regulated items, went from -0.5% in November to -0.3% in December.",
        "The annual variation in the price of non-tradable goods and services, excluding food and regulated items, stood at 3.5% in December, after having increased in November.",
        "As for the core inflation indicators, their average went from 2.4% in November to 2.5% in December.",
        "The lowest indicator is still the CPI, excluding food and regulated items, with an annual rate of 1.8%.",
        "The annual variation in producer prices (PPI) was 4.4% in December as opposed to 3.7% in November, with a monthly variation of 1.6%.",
        "Inflation expectations at one year increased and were in the upper half of the target range for 2011.",
        "The long-term expectations (at five to ten years), measured with government bonds, surpassed the ceiling of that range Growth In the third quarter, GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.6%, which is less than was expected by the market and by Banco de la República.",
        "This was explained primarily by the downturn in building construction and works, and to a lesser extent by low growth in coal and by less favorable performance than was expected for coffee.",
        "On the demand side, the lower figure was the result of limited growth in investment, particularly for construction, coupled with export performance that not live up to expectations.",
        "Household consumption performed well and accelerated compared to the figures for the first half of the year.",
        "The increase in consumption, plus strong investment in machinery and equipment and in transport equipment kept imports up.",
        "The performance of the Colombian economy during the final quarter of 2010 is expected to be similar to what it was during the third quarter, spearheaded mainly by external demand.",
        "Winter weather, which intensified towards the end of the year, had serious negative effects not only on agriculture, but also on gross fixed capital formation and on certain mining exports, which were not carried out due to problems with extraction and/or transport.",
        "The consumer confidence indicator remained high during the fourth quarter, despite having fallen on several occasions in recent months.",
        "This would indicate household consumption continued to perform well during the fourth quarter.",
        "The foregoing, in turn, is reflected in the behavior of the commerce indicators.",
        "According to the latest data released by DANE, they showed an annual increase of 21.4% by November, while consumer imports, in dollars, were up 51.3% by that same month.",
        "The investment indicators reflected mixed performance during the fourth quarter.",
        "By November, imports of capital goods, in dollars, showed high growth rates.",
        "However, construction had yet to demonstrate favorable performance, partly due to the effects of the weather and to problems with contracting and carrying out works.",
        "In the case of foreign trade, total exports in dollars by November showed an annual variation of 19.5%, largely due to the mining, energy and coffee sector, which posted an annual increase of 30.0%.",
        "The cumulative 12- month increase in total exports comes to 20.0%.",
        "Total imports in dollars posted an annual variation of 34.5% by November.",
        "The cumulative 12-month rise in total imports is 20.8%.",
        "The supply indicators available for the fourth quarter show mixed performance and suggest growth could slow in various branches of the economy such as industry, energy, gas, water and transport.",
        "In contrast, the information from the Fedesarrollo business opinion survey shows industrial orders remain at high levels and inventories are down.",
        "Both these situations are associated with favorable performance in the sector.",
        "However, the same survey also reflects a drop in expectations for production and sales at three months.",
        "The rise in formal employment for workers with the most education could imply an increase in their earnings, which could be partly responsible for the improvement in consumption.",
        "There was a certain amount of recovery in formal employment during the course of 2010 up to December, particularly in the final part of the year.",
        "Historically low real and nominal interest rates on lending, coupled with a build-up in the consumer and mortgage loan portfolio throughout the last half of 2010, are the factors that contributed to growth and lead one to expect more momentum in consumption and a recovery in investment in buildings during the final quarter.",
        "There has been an important increase in the commercial loan portfolio as well Financial Variables In December, nominal interest rates on consumer and ordinary lending averaged 16.9% and 9.3%, in that order, with respective increases of 6 bp and 11 bp compared to the month before.",
        "The interest rate on mortgage lending was 12.2%, which implies no variation with respect to the figure on record for November.",
        "Annual growth in the total gross loan portfolio in pesos came to 14.1% in December, as opposed to 11.9% the month before.",
        "The mortgage and consumer loan portfolios are still the most dynamic, with respective annual variations of 21.3% and 15.5%.",
        "By December, the annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio was 12.8%.",
        "The interest rates on one-year and five-year government bonds rose by 11 bp and 41 bp, respectively, between January 3 and January 28, 2011.",
        "Interest on the 10-year bond was 8.5% by the same date, which is 19 bp more than the rate posted on January 3 The External Context One of the highlights in the external context during the past month was the favorable performance of several developed economies such as the United States, with 2.9% growth during the year, and Germany, with an increase of 3.5%.",
        "Even so, Europe continued to experience a major slowdown in the second half 2010 compared to the first six months of the year, due to less than favorable performance by the economies in Europe’s periphery.",
        "As for the European economies with fiscal problems, the markets would have regarded the debt placed last month by Portugal, Spain and Italy as a positive signal, one that was mirrored in a decline in risk perception, measured through CDs, and in the rate on the five-year and 10-year bonds issued by those countries.",
        "Better economic indicators for the United States, coupled with last month’s approval of fiscal plans, have enhanced the prospects for that economy in 2011 and for the world economy in general.",
        "Nevertheless, analysts continue to eye the job market with concern, as it has yet to show clear signs of recovery.",
        "In 2011 and after a brief period of calm, the region’s emerging economies again experienced pressure for their currencies to appreciate.",
        "The soundness of their fundamentals and the good outlook for economic performance in 2011, as well as high commodity prices and low risk premiums, probably will continue to help spur capital flows to these countries AND The following points were emphasized by the Board during its deliberations: Inflation forecasts for 2011 The variation in prices for tradable goods The delayed effect of monetary policy measures on production and prices Forecasts for growth in the economy and employment during 2011 The performance of consumer confidence and investment Recent movement in the loan portfolio in the financial system The increase in the price of financial assets and housing Inflation expectations The recent behavior of capital flows The performance of government bonds The risk balance between growth and inflation The need to maintain the credibility of the country’s monetary authority and to anchor inflation expectations around the long-term target Data on growth and the forecasts for the world economy The Board of Directors emphasized the following with respect to how inflation performed during the month: (i) The annual variation in the consumer price index was 3.17% in 2010, which is more than the Bank’s technical team and the market expected.",
        "The rise in inflation, primarily due to higher food prices as a result of the weather, will be temporary.",
        "(ii) The core inflation indicators increased as well, but at a slower pace, and are still below the -point of the target range.",
        "(iii) The various measurements of inflation expectations at one year rose and were in the upper half of the target range for inflation.",
        "Growth in the Colombian economy during the second half of 2010 was less than what was forecast several months back.",
        "Fundamentally, this was due to the behavior of investment in works and the impact of La Niña weather on farm production, mining output and transport.",
        "In contrast, household consumption and borrowing are increasing at high rates, as is corporate debt and investment in machinery and equipment.",
        "The latter is partly due to historically low nominal and real interest rates.",
        "The economies of Colombia’s major trading partners are growing slightly more than was expected, although there still is a great deal of uncertainty about how some of them will perform in the future.",
        "At the same time, the Asian and Latin American countries are showing strong growth and price pressures.",
        "Some of their central banks have hinted at changes in the stance of their monetary policy.",
        "International commodity prices are at historically high levels.",
        "The members of the Board analyzed the conditions in which, given the probable scenarios in the months ahead, it might be necessary to change the stance of Banco de la República’s monetary policy by making it less expansive.",
        "The points they stressed as being fundamental for an eventual hike in the intervention interest rate are, among others, growing upward inflation expectations above the target range, the important momentum in internal demand, high asset prices, and the accelerated build-up in lending.",
        "On the other hand, low core inflation levels and the recent relative stability in prices for non-tradable goods, excluding food and regulated items, the possible temporary nature of the increase in food prices, the unstable situation with respect to the sovereign debt of several European countries, and the lack of certainty surrounding the forecasts for inflation and growth in the months ahead were underscored as factors in favor of keeping the rate at its present level.",
        "Finally, the members of the Board believe if the economy remains on an upward path, as anticipated, or inflation expectations show signs of deviating from the targets, conditions will be right for gradually withdrawing the monetary stimulus in an effort to strengthen the sustained increase in production and employment The Board of Directors agreed not to change Banco de la República’s intervention rate, which will remain at 3%.",
        "A regular meeting of Banco de la República’s Board of Directors was held in the city of Bogotá on April 29, 2011.",

        "The following is a summary of the main topics addressed during the meeting Annual consumer inflation in March was 3.19% (0.27% for the month).",
        "This is two basis points (bp) more than in February.",
        "Upward pressure was brought to bear by the annual change in regulated prices, with 6.9% inflation at March compared to 6.2% in February, and by tradables, excluding food and regulated prices, with -0.2% in March as opposed to -0.3% in February.",
        "Downward pressure came from the annual variation in food prices, which was 3.9% in March versus 4.4% in February.",
        "In this group, the main contribution to the slowdown originated with perishable foods, reversing part of the upward shock caused by the first wave of winter weather.",
        "The annual variation in prices for non-tradables, excluding food and regulated goods, remained virtually stable at 3.4% (with a two bp reduction in March compared to February) As for the annual core inflation indicators, their average rose from 2.59% in February to 2.65% in March.",
        "At 1.8%, the lowest indicator was still the CPI excluding food and regulated items.",
        "The change in producer prices (PPI) was 4.9% by March, which is more than in February (4.6%).",
        "In terms of the make-up of the PPI, there was an increase in the annual variation in the imported component and in the component related to produced and consumed goods.",
        "Banco de la República’s monthly expectation survey with data at March points to 3.3% inflation by the end of 2011, which is less than what was anticipated the month before (3.5%).",
        "For expectations further out (five and 10 years), which are based on government bonds, the reduction was clearer, but they are still above the ceiling of the target range (4%) Growth GDP rose 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010.",
        "As a result, the increase in GDP for all of 2010 came to 4.3%.",
        "When analyzed by type of expenditure, the largest contribution to this growth came from household consumption, especially durable and semi-durable goods.",
        "Government consumption and investment also contributed to the increase.",
        "All the components in this last aggregate posted positive annual growth; investment in buildings was the only exception.",
        "Consequently, the rate of investment to GDP in 2010 was 25.6%, in real terms.",
        "On the other hand, net exports contributed negatively to GDP growth during 2010.",
        "Available data for the first quarter of 2011 suggest strong economic growth fueled by the expansion in internal demand.",
        "Private consumption continues to benefit from interest rates (on consumer and credit card lending) that are still below their historic averages, plus a hefty rise in household lending and an increase in better-quality jobs.",
        "This improved outlook on household consumption is supported by the information on retail sales measured by DANE.",
        "They were up 13.2% in February, bolstered by vehicle sales (when excluding this factor, the growth in retail sales was 5.5%).",
        "These favorable conditions appear to be reflected in consumer confidence, as illustrated by the upswing in the Fedesarrollo consumer confidence index.",
        "As for investment, the trend in imports of machinery and equipment by February suggests a good deal of continued momentum.",
        "The figures on building permits point in the same direction.",
        "They exhibited important growth at the end of last year, fueled largely by low-income housing.",
        "This information is consistent with the high rates of growth in the real mortgage loan portfolio at March (15%).",
        "On the supply side, annual industrial growth was 2.4% by February 2011.",
        "This rate, which is low compared to the one observed in January and to what was anticipated by Banco de la República’s technical team, is explained by the drop in iron and steel production resulting from a partial closure at Cerro Matoso, which is expected to continue until August.",
        "Performance in most of the other branches is good and coincides with the favorable development of other indicators associated with the sector (orders, inventories, demand for unregulated energy, lending and production expectations).",
        "With regard to foreign trade, total exports in dollars at February reflected an annual variation of 37.2%, bolstered primarily by the mining and coffee sector, with an annual increase of 49.8%.",
        "The cumulative 12-month rise in total exports comes to 23.6%.",
        "Total imports in dollars posted 35.1% annual growth at February.",
        "The cumulative 12-month increase in total exports is 29.2%.",
        "Banco de la República’s technical team raised the growth forecast for 2011 by 50bp to a range of 4.0% to 6.0%.",
        "This estimate takes into account the negative impact the resurgence of severe winter weather could have on the country’s economic activity.",
        "With these forecasts, it is more likely output during the second quarter will be closer to its potential Financial Variables In March, nominal interest rates on consumer and ordinary borrowing averaged 17.6% and 10 % respectively, with consumer lending up by 5 bp and ordinary lending by 25 bp compared to the month before.",
        "The mortgage lending rate was 12.5%, which is 15 bp higher than in February Annual growth in the total gross loan portfolio in domestic currency came to 16% in March, having been 15.5% the month before.",
        "The consumer and mortgage loan portfolios were still the most dynamic, posting respective annual variations of 18.4% and 19%.",
        "By March, the annual increase in the commercial loan portfolio came to 13.8%.",
        "During April, interest rates on one-year government bonds rose by 5 bp, while those on five and ten-year bonds declined by 31 bp and 15 bp, respectively The external context During the first quarter of 2011, the indicators for the real sector in the developed economies were mixed.",
        "On the one hand, US economic performance has been relatively good, despite 1.8% growth in the first quarter of 2011 (which was less than expected).",
        "On the other hand, the recovery in the Euro Zone remains modest, led primarily by Germany, while the recovery of the Japanese economy is threatened in the short term by the natural disaster and nuclear emergency in that country.",
        "The positive results for the US economy are based on internal and external factors, which can be summarized in a better job market, growing household consumption and dynamic foreign trade, with exports at pre-crisis levels.",
        "Nevertheless, there are still latent risks to the US economy, which may delay its short and -term recovery.",
        "As the Fed warned, recovery is proceeding at a “moderate pace” because of the difficulties that have emerged.",
        "Among them are: i) a huge fiscal deficit that limits action on the part of the federal government, ii) higher oil and food prices, which could hamper the country’s growth and that of the rest of the world, iii) less than robust job creation, and, iv) a continued lag in the housing market, although the latest figures have been favorable.",
        "Therefore and considering inflation expectations have not increased, despite international price hikes, the Fed decided at its meeting on Wednesday, April 27, to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged.",
        "Likewise, it maintained its policy to purchase Treasury bonds (US$600 billion) up until the end of the second quarter of 2011, as had been announced initially.",
        "In contrast, annual inflation in the Euro Zone has accelerated and is still above target, due to higher international prices and good growth in the major European economies.",
        "This is partly what prompted the European Central Bank to raise the intervention interest rate by 25 bp at its meeting in April.",
        "The markets’ nervousness about the sustainability of the debt of peripheral European economies increased again in recent weeks, due to the political instability in Portugal, the lack of credibility surrounding some of the fiscal austerity programs and the possible restructuring of government debt in Portugal and Greece.",
        "Even so, analysts have upgraded their Euro zone growth forecasts for this year.",
        "For example, the IMF raised its forecast from 1.5% to 1.6%.",
        "The emerging countries are preserving good momentum and ended 2010 with important growth.",
        "The figures available up to the first quarter of 2011 suggest growth will continue throughout the year, but at a more moderate pace.",
        "Higher international prices have begun to affect inflation in some countries, particularly the Asian economies and Brazil, prompting most monetary authorities to raise their intervention rates.",
        "This strategy is expected to continue during the rest of the year, given inflationary pressures and the decline in output gaps.",
        "Thanks to good performance by the economies in the region, their low risk premiums and low interest rates in the developed countries, the flow of capital towards Latin America continues.",
        "As a result, its currencies have appreciated.",
        "International commodity prices are expected to remain high during 2011.",
        "Good performance by the emerging economies and various supply problems have bolstered Colombia’s terms of trade to record high levels, which would support exports and an improvement in income for Colombians AND The members of the Board weighted the possibility of an intervention interest rate hike at this meeting, as part of a continuing effort to gradually reduce the monetary stimulus.",
        "The following points were underscored: (i) Interest rates are at record low levels in real and nominal terms.",
        "(ii) All the lending components continue to grow at important rates, coupled with low real interest rates on loans and a build-up in household borrowing.",
        "(iii) The 4.3% GDP increase in 2010 was more than expected and the figures for the first quarter of this year suggest the economy still is growing.",
        "(iv) The country’s terms of trade continue to improve and are now at record high levels, contributing to the growth in national income.",
        "(v) Consumer expectations have increased and investment in machinery and equipment remains vigorous.",
        "The situation with respect to works is believed to be similar.",
        "(vi) Banco de la República’s technical team raised its growth forecast for 2011 by 50bp to a range of 4.0% to 6.0%.",
        "The lower part of this range takes into account the negative impact the resurgence of severe winter weather could have on the country’s economic activity.",
        "(vii) The job market indicators have improved.",
        "(viii) Output is more likely to be closer to its potential during the second half of the year.",
        "(ix) Housing price indicators continue to rise and are now near record highs.",
        "(x) The recent appreciation in the peso was considered as well.",
        "In terms of risks, the following was observed: (i) International commodity prices rose in recent months, including those for oil and food, due to strong growth in demand in the emerging economies and negative supply shocks.",
        "(ii) Inflationary pressures increased in many countries and some central banks in Latin America have raised interest rates, as the European Central Bank.",
        "(iii) Extremely low interest rates for too long a period of time ultimately can pose a risk to financial stability, the sustainability of growth and future inflation.",
        "(iv) An exceptionally low interest rate may be inconsistent with near potential growth anticipated for 2011 and 2012 and inflation forecast close to the - point of the long-term target range.",
        "(v) Inflation expectations at more than one year are above target.",
        "Considering all these factors and the time it takes monetary policy to exert an impact on aggregate spending and inflation, the Board of Directors felt the move towards a less expansive policy must continue.",
        "Banco de la República’s new interest rate still supports short-term growth in output and employment.",
        "The intervention rate hikes will help to keep inflation within the target range for this year and the next, and to avoid future financial imbalances.",
        "Moreover, the anticipated monetary policy actions, coupled with an austere fiscal stance, should reduce the extent to which the intervention interest rate would have to be raised in relation to the levels witnessed in previous economic cycles The Board of Directors agreed to increase Banco de la República’s intervention rate by 25 bp, placing it at 3.75%."

        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, September 30, 2016.",
        "In attendance were Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor of the Central Bank; and co-directors Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, Cesar Vallejo Mejia, and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of the outlook on the macroeconomic situation by the technical staff of the Central Bank (section 1), followed by a review of the main discussion regarding monetary policy by the Board of Directors (section 2).Furtherdetail on the macroeconomic situationprepared by the technical staff from Banco de la República will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report of August and in the statistical annex CONTEXTIn August, annual consumer inflation stood at 8.10%, a figure lower than the one recorded in July (8.97%) and below the forecast of the Central Bank and the market.",
        "The slowdown of inflation was explained largely by the behavior of food prices, among them the group of perishable items.",
        "Tradables (excluding food and regulated) and regulated items also contributed to the reduction of inflation.The average of the four core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank decreased slightly, moving from 6.61% in July to 6.56% in August.The data from Sipsa (DANE) suggest that food prices would continue falling in September.",
        "According to the same source, food supply in the central markets remains high.The annual variation of the PPI exhibited a significant reduction (from 8.38% in July to 4.89% in August).",
        "This suggests that the pressures of non-labor costs continue to decline.In September, inflation expectations declined, but remain above the target.",
        "These reductions were as per the monthly survey to economic analysts by the Central Bank to one and two years (20 bp and 11 bp, reaching 4.35% and 3.61%, respectively).",
        "Those calculated on the basis of the public debt bonds (TES) to 2, 3 and 5 years (3.57%, 3.45% and 3.37%) recorded more significant declines (78, 62, and 43 bp) during the month (to 28 September).The available data on economic activity for the third quarter are scarce and are affected significantly by the trucking strike registered between June and July.",
        "In general, the figures for retail sales, industrial production, and cement production exhibited setbacks in July.",
        "Similarly, the labor market showed some deterioration.Some economic indicators suggest improvements in August such as energy demand (unregulated), the perception of the industry and trade, and the consumer confidence index.",
        "By contrast, coffee and oil production continued to fall.Thus, given the slowdown that the Colombian economy has been experiencing and the negative effects of the trucking strike (which would not be fully offset in some sectors in the following months), economic growth in the third quarter is likely to be lower than in the second.On the other hand, according to the figures of the balance of payments for the first half of the year, the current account deficit relative to GDP was 4.8%, , 1.5 percentage points less than the one observed in the same period of 2015.",
        "The reduction of the external deficit was explained by the lower net outflows by factor revenue and services, and to a lesser extent, by the lower deficit in the balance of goods and the higher income from transfers.",
        "This is consistent with the slowdown in domestic demand, the more expensive imports on account of the cumulative effect of the depreciation of the peso, and the lower profits of firms with FDI, particularly for the mining-energy sector.",
        "To July, the information from DANE on foreign trade suggests that the trade deficit would continue to adjust.In July, the terms of trade (foreign trade methodology) were close to the average of 2015.",
        "The recent behavior of international oil prices and those of the main basic goods imported by Colombia suggest that the recovery trend continues.As for the external context, in the United States, the FED left the benchmark interest rate unaltered in an environment of relatively good labor market performance, but with low growth of retail sales and industrial production.In the euro zone, improvement in the performance of some real indicators was observed, while in China the data suggest that its economy continues to gradually slow down.",
        "In Latin America, the figures available for GDP in the second quarter are lower than those reported for the first quarter, except for Mexico and Brazil; the economies of Argentina and Brazil exhibit contractions.",
        "In Ecuador, the figure for the first quarters suggests a deepening of the recession.In recent weeks, the international financial markets maintained a low volatility.",
        "The risk premia and the currencies of most Latin American countries remained relatively stable.",
        "This takes place in a context in which the market deems it is more probable for the FED to increase its benchmark interest rate in December, and that there would be at least another adjustment in 2017.In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually.",
        "The effects of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations have begun to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue.",
        "This, together with the monetary policy actions taken so far, should lead inflation to its target range in 2017   AND OPTIONSAfter analyzing the most recent information on the Colombian economy and its prospects, the Board opted to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered.",
        "The data on growth, inflation, current account deficit, and confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs show that the adjustment of the economy to the cycle of prices of commodities continues in an orderly manner.",
        "This adjustment is consistent with the transmission of the monetary policy measures adopted by the Board in the past year.The growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are compatible with the reduction that national income has experienced in the last two years, and reveal a noticeable resilience of the Colombian economy to external shocks, vis-à-vis other emerging economies that are exporters of commodities.",
        "One of the members of the board pointed out that potential GDP could possibly be lower than the estimations used to calculate the output gap, as has happened in other countries.Annual inflation started to decline in August, which shows that the monetary policy measures have been effective.",
        "The fall in the prices of food, tradables, and (to a lesser extent) of core inflation indicators, plus the decrease in prices of imported foodstuffs, the moderate revaluation of the exchange rate, and the end of the negative effect of the trucking strike on product supply also contributed to reduce inflation.The current account deficit has shown a faster adjustment than initially forecast largely associated with a reduction of imports and to lesser outflows by factor revenue.",
        "This adjustment must continue aided by the slowdown in domestic demand, the bullish behavior of oil prices, and the effects of the accumulated real devaluation.Inflation and core inflation indicators remain high exceeding the target range, as do some measures of inflation expectations.",
        "This generates uncertainty about the compliance of the target in 2017, and makes it advisable and prudent to maintain the current monetary policy stance.One of the board members pointed out that the data from last month show that the risk balance is more inclined to the slowdown of growth than to inflation, and stated that, should this situation accentuate, a reduction of the benchmark interest rate should be considered DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%.The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was reached unanimously.Bogotá,",

        "In May, the international price of oil continued rising and risk premia remained stable at last month's levels.",
        "However, like other currencies in the region, the peso depreciated, probably associated with possible increases in the Fed's benchmark interest rate sooner than had been expected by the market So far in May, indicators of volatility in international financial markets and long-term bond rates in developed economies remained low The most recent information of global economic activity suggests that the second quarter would be somewhat better than the first.",
        "In the United States, household consumption would have boosted, Europe would continue recovering slowly, and China would continue to slow down, although less than expected thanks to the stimulus policies As for Latin America, the data for GDP in the first quarter of 2016 from Chile and Mexico were better than at the end of 2015, but still low compared to those of recent years.",
        "In the same period, the activity rate in Peru points at an annual growth of 4.4%, while for Brazil, this indicator suggests that the economy would continue in a deep recession For Colombia, so far this year to March, the US dollar value for exports fell 31.8% annually, and that for imports 25.1%.",
        "In both cases, significant declines in the major groups were observed Regarding growth in the first quarter, the available information suggests that domestic demand would have continued slowing down, as had been expected.",
        "As for private consumption, in addition to the deterioration in confidence indicators, retail sales (excluding vehicles) in the first quarter of 2016 grew less than in the previous quarter.",
        "This last result is maintained after adjusting the series by its seasonal component.",
        "Regarding investment, the data on imports of capital goods different from construction (in constant pesos) anticipate a fall Including the new results of economic activity, the technical staff maintained its growth forecast at 2.5% on a yearly basis for the first quarter, within a range between 1.8% and 3.2%.",
        "Part of the lower growth in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 would be associated with the effect of the Easter holiday, and should be partially reversed in April.",
        "For all 2016, the growth forecast would be between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 2.5% as the most likely outcome In April, annual consumer inflation stood at 7.93%, with a slight decrease compared to last month (7.98%).",
        "The slowdown is explained by the behavior of regulated items, particularly public utilities.",
        "Food prices continue to rise, although at a somewhat slower pace than in the past few months.",
        "Those of tradables and non-tradables (excluding food and regulated items) also continue to increase.",
        "The average of core inflation indicators continued increasing, reaching 6.38% The different measures of inflation expectations monitored by the Central Bank remained relatively stable vis-à-vis the previous month.",
        "In all cases they are above 4.3%, except those obtained from the survey applied to economic analysts to two years (3.69%) The effects of El Niño, pass-through of the accumulated depreciation of the peso to prices, and the activation of indexation mechanisms on prices and salaries would keep inflation high during the first semester of the year.",
        "Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with monetary policy decisions, should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In summary, the Colombian economy is adjusting in an orderly manner to the strong external shocks recorded since 2014.",
        "The risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand is moderate, and there is still an excess of expenditure with respect to national income, which is reflected in a high current account deficit.",
        "Inflation has accelerated so far this year on account of the depreciation of the peso, El Niño, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agree that it is still necessary to continue increasing the benchmark interest rate in order to lead inflation to its 3.0% target ± 1.0% by the end of 2017.The majority of the Board Members proposed a 25 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "This proposal was based on the following considerations: (i) Policy interest rates, expressed in real terms, have increased sharply since March as a result of the Board's actions and the stabilization of inflation expectations.",
        "As a result of this behavior, the level of the real interest rate is higher than the average for the last decade and consistent with a neutral rate, according to some recent studies.",
        "(ii) This effect is reinforced by a full and quick transmission of the policy rates to the rates of the financial system.",
        "(iii) Several real sector indicators show that, although with sectoral and regional differences, domestic demand is slowing down, achieving the purposes of the monetary policy.",
        "(iv) The effects of the slowdown of demand on inflation will take time to be seen, considering that the shocks derived from El Niño and depreciation are still present.",
        "Once the effects of these shocks have passed, the slowdown in demand will be reflected on inflation and inflation expectations, increasing the risk of an over-adjustment in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "(v) In the near future, there will be relevant information available on the international monetary conditions and their impact on emerging economies.",
        "In this framework, the majority of the members of the Board considered that an increase lower than the one from the previous session is the appropriate one to start contracting the thrust of the policy.",
        "Also, it allows to track the evolution of the adjustment in domestic demand (given the lags of the monetary policy on this variable), and it enables a proper reaction to the information on the monetary policy stance of the Fed and its effect on the Colombian economy.Other Board Members proposed a 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "In April, the average of core inflation continued to increase for nineteenth consecutive month, and expectations remain above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "Likewise, there are signs of persistence of inflation and the activation of indexation mechanisms, and the risk of an additional pass-through of depreciation to domestic prices cannot be disregarded, particularly considering the Fed's monetary policy stance.",
        "All this puts the effective convergence of inflation to the target range before the end of 2017 at risk.",
        "The current dynamics of domestic demand indicates that deceleration is not excessive and gives room for a 50 bp increase in the benchmark reference rate, encouraging the anchoring of inflation expectations more clearly and facilitating convergence of inflation to the target range in 2017 DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.25%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, July 29, 2016.",

        "While the US dollar has strengthened vis-à-vis the main currencies of the world, indicators of financial volatility, risk premia, and exchange rates of emerging countries returned to pre-brexit levels.However, it cannot be ruled out that the brexit may have significant impacts on global economy.",
        "Uncertainty over the adjustments that the United Kingdom and the countries of the EU would need to assume may affect the confidence of consumers and enterprises, thus interrupting the slow recovery of the European economy, which would impact global growth negatively.In the United States, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue with the gradual normalization of the monetary policy.",
        "In this context, it is foreseen that the monetary policy in developed economies will remain highly expansive.",
        "This could encourage a greater flow of capital to emerging countries, as has been observed in recent weeks.Growth forecasts for the country's main trading partners for the whole year and for 2017 incorporated into this report, include a slightly lower growth rate for the euro zone and the United States than had been foreseen in the previous quarterly report.",
        "China would continue with a slowdown, as has been observed.",
        "Negative growth is still expected for the region, with a slight rebound in 2017.In recent weeks, the price of oil has shown stability, while international prices of other goods exported by Colombia have increased and several foodstuffs imported by the country have decreased.",
        "With this, the terms of trade continued to recover and are expected to be higher for the entire year than had been forecast in the previous quarterly report, although lower than in 2015.Foreign trade figures from DANE for the two-month period of April-May show a sharp fall in the value of exports (-22.3%), although lower than the one recorded in the first quarter.",
        "Imports fell 18.1% in the same period.",
        "This suggests that the correction of the deficit in the trade balance observed in the first quarter would have continued during the second.Regarding the country's current account, the trend of adjustment of the current external imbalance observed in the first quarter is expected to continue for the remainder of the year.",
        "For 2016, a current account deficit of around 5.3% is foreseen, lower than the one registered in 2015.In Colombia, the data available on economic activity for the second quarter suggest that the economy would have grown at a pace similar to that of the first quarter.",
        "The fall in investment would have been lower, offsetting the moderation of private consumption and the low growth rates for public consumption.",
        "On the supply side, the indicators available for the second quarter of 2016 show that the industry and trade recorded favorable dynamics, while mining, agriculture, and energy had a less-dynamic performance.The seasonally adjusted labor market series show that, to May, the unemployment rate remains low, given that the labor supply (measured as the global participation rate) has fallen, which has offset the deterioration in employment creation.",
        "Job creation continues to be driven by salaried employment, which suggests that the quality has not deteriorated.Transmission of the increases in the benchmark interest rate to credit rates continues in a context in which credit has slowed down somewhat.With all this, economic growth between 2.0% and 3.2% is expected for the second quarter.",
        "For 2016, the most likely growth figure was revised downwards, from 2.5% to 2.3%, with a forecast range between 1.5% and 3.0%.",
        "In this projection, both consumption (public and private) as well as investment continue slowing down, partly as a response to the slower dynamics of national income.For 2017, growth of the economy is estimated within a range between 1.5% and 3.5%.In June, yearly consumer inflation increased, reaching 8.60%.",
        "This increase is explained by the variation in the prices of food (14.28%), regulated items (6.71%) and, to a lesser extent, non-tradable inflation (excluding food and regulated items) (4.97%).",
        "The average of core inflation indicators increased 20 bp, standing at 6.52%.Inflation expectations obtained from the monthly survey of economic analysts increased to one year (from 4.37% to 4.61%), but remained stable for a two-year period (moving from 3.67% to 3.68%).",
        "Those obtained from the quarterly survey of economic expectations to 1 and 2 years increased, exceeding 5.0%.",
        "Regarding the average for June, so far this month, the expectations embedded in public debt bonds (Breakeven Inflation) were relatively stable for all terms (2, 3, and 5 years), posting between 4.0% and 4.4%.Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with monetary policy decisions, should lead inflation towards its target range during 2017.In all, inflation rose due to the past depreciation of the peso, the lagged effects of El Niño (which is already over), inflation expectations exceeding the target, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms.",
        "Similarly, the Colombian economy continues to adjust in an orderly manner to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is correcting gradually AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board emphasized that the recent data on inflation exceeded the expectations of the market and the Central Bank's technical staff.",
        "The causes and consequences of this phenomenon were discussed by the members of the Board to determine their position regarding the monetary policy stance.The majority of Co-directors voted in favor of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "This group highlighted that the results of inflation continue increasing beyond the forecast, with accelerations in the yearly variation of the prices of several components of the CPI, and monthly adjustments in the prices of an atypically high proportion of the items comprised by this index.",
        "They noted that persistence of inflation at levels above the target reinforces deanchoring of inflation expectations and activates indexation mechanisms.",
        "This reduces the credibility of the monetary authority and decreases the probability of reaching the target of 3.0% (+/- 1 pp) in 2017.",
        "An additional increase in the benchmark interest rate decreases the likelihood of a scenario in which inflation persists at a level incompatible with the target established by the Board of Directors of Banco de la República.Within the majoritarian group, the co-directors emphasized several ideas.",
        "Some noted that insufficient efforts to control high or increasing inflation at the moment would very probably result in loss of credibility, and, therefore, in an eventual disinflation, more costly in terms of output and employment.",
        "They also stated that, facing the strong uncertainty of international markets, the risk of future pressures towards depreciation persist, and through this channel, also on inflation.",
        "Additionally, they noted that, given the orderly adjustment of the Colombian economy, there is still room for a further increase in the benchmark interest rate without generating an excessive deceleration.",
        "Finally, another member of the group stated that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the level at which expectations are being anchored.",
        "As a result, there are likely scenarios in which the anchoring point may be greater than the one implicit in the prices of public debt.",
        "Also, that there are probable scenarios of an over-adjustment of the monetary policy.",
        "With the recent information, this member stressed that on this occasion there is a greater risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations, for which reason s/he supported the increase in the benchmark interest rate.Another group of co-directors voted in favor of maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 7.5%.",
        "This decision was justified on the following reasons: (i) domestic demand shows evident signs of deceleration; ii) the expected evolution of global economy, particularly that of Colombia’s trading partners, suggests a further deterioration of foreign demand; (iii) domestic demand will receive another negative shock in the policy horizon, either from the contraction in spending implied by the draft of the budget for 2017, or from the tax reform announced by the Government; (iv) the recent increase in inflation is due to new supply shocks, which have not affected medium term expectations; and (v) the current level of the interest rates is high, which induces convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.75%.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, February 19, 2016.",

        "According to analysts, this can be explained by factors such as concerns about financial stability, the prices of commodities, and global growth (particularly in China and other emerging countries)The rates of the long-term sovereign bonds of the United States fell significantly, suggesting that the markets expect normalization of the monetary policy in the US to be slower than projected by the FOMC last DecemberIn Latin America, currencies depreciated and the countries’ risk premia increased, reaching the highest levels since 2009The US dollar, on the other hand, reversed part of its appreciation vis-à-vis the main currenciesThe price of oil remained at its lowest levels since 2003.",
        "The announcement issued by some of the main oil producers about not increasing their production would not impact the market, as there would still be an oversupply of oil.",
        "The international prices of gold and silver rose significantly, while those of copper, coal, nickel and food remained low.",
        "With this, Colombia’s terms of trade would have remained at their lowest since 2003In January, inflation would have continued low in the United States, the euro zone and China, while in Latin America it would maintain its upward trend and out of the monetary authorities’ target range in Brazil, Chile, Peru, and ColombiaRegarding real activity, GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 shows that the United States has slowed down and the euro zone continued recovering slowly.",
        "In the region, Peru exhibited an important acceleration according to activity indicators.",
        "The scarce information available for January suggests that these trends would continueDuring 2015, the value of exports in US dollars fell 35.1%, particularly due to the behavior of the prices of mining goods.",
        "Preliminary information from DIAN for January shows that they are still contracting.",
        "On the other hand, according to the preliminary report on foreign trade by DIAN, regarding imports, in December 2015 the total recorded an annual 25.4% fall, while in January of 2016 it would have contracted 34.3% annuallyOn February 16, Standard & Poor's (S&P) revised the prospects of Colombia's long-term sovereign debt from stable to negative.",
        "This decision was reached considering the decline in the forecasts for oil prices, which generates risks of a further deterioration in the foreign position of the country as well as in public finances and growth, particularly if the government does not take the fiscal measures required on time.10.In Colombia, the information available for the fourth quarter of 2015 suggests that the economy would have grown at a rate similar to that of the third quarter.",
        "Industry showed a favorable expansion, while trade slowed down.",
        "In 2015, the unemployment rate stopped falling and would have begun to rise slightly, according to the trend component of the seasonally adjusted series.11.In January, consumer confidence plummeted, reaching the lowest since April 2002.",
        "The component for current economic conditions, as well as that for expectations, fell.",
        "Also, the future perception of the labor market deteriorated.12.On the supply side, oil production fell below one million barrels per day, and coffee production slowed down due to the effect of a high base of comparison in 2015.13.In the same month, the real interest rates on commercial and consumer credits began to increase, although they remain at low levels compared to their historical averages.14.Given that the information is very scarce, the forecast range for GDP growth for 2016, which shows a downward bias, is maintained.",
        "Growth would post between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 2.7% as the most likely figure.15.Regarding yearly inflation, it accelerated in January reaching 7.45%, particularly due to the sharp increase in food prices (12.26%).",
        "Within this group, perishable goods increased 31.3%.",
        "Non-food inflation also accelerated (from 5.17% to 5.54%).",
        "The average of core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank stood at 5.73% on a yearly basis.16.The annual CPI variation in January is the highest since December 2008.17.According to the monthly survey applied to financial analysts in February, a yearly inflation rate of 5.49% is expected for December 2016, a figure higher than expected in the January survey.",
        "To twelve and twenty-four months, analysts expect 4.54% and 3.70%, respectively, figures similar to those from the previous survey (4.50% and 3.68%).",
        "Inflation expectations embedded in public debt bonds with information to February 16 registered above 4.5% for 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, at levels similar to those of January.18.The effects of El Niño, pass-through of the depreciation of the peso to prices, and the activation of indexation mechanisms on prices and salaries could keep inflation high during the first semester of the year.",
        "Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with actions in monetary policy should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In summary, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate, largely related to the fall in the price of oil, continue exerting upside inflationary pressures.",
        "Inflation expectations remain high and an additional pass-through of the devaluation of the peso to domestic prices is foreseeable.",
        "Uncertainty about the persistence of the low level of the Consumer Confidence Index and its impact on household spending is high.",
        "Other indicators of economic activity are compatible with the technical staff's growth forecast for 2016 (2.7% as the most likely figure, within a range between 1.5% and 3.2%) AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed on the need to continue increasing the benchmark interest rate in order to ensure convergence of inflation expectations to the goal and an increase of domestic demand consistent with a lower growth of national income.",
        "They also highlighted that the adjustment of the current account deficit should be a priority of macroeconomic policy.",
        "Accordingly, they agree in that the monetary and fiscal policies should act in order to reduce the increase in public and private spending, thus creating the conditions for the economy to achieve convergence of inflation to the target and external sustainability.The majority of the Board Members considered that it is appropriate to continue with the path of 25 bp increases.",
        "Some of them pointed out that recent data on consumer confidence show that economic variables may experience strong changes shortly, which stresses the suitability of a gradual adjustment process to incorporate the new information.",
        "Once more, the evidence of stronger pass-through mechanisms of the monetary policy that might impact the future evolution of the benchmark interest rate was noted.",
        "Others emphasized that in recent weeks, the price of oil has reached a more stable level, which could indicate that in the coming months the devaluation of the peso would not continue at the pace observed recently, which would in turn contribute to the stabilization of inflation.",
        "Finally, some stressed that the pace of adjustment of the benchmark interest rate could increase should there be inflationary surprises.The other members of the Board proposed a 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They are especially concerned with inflation expectations being de-anchored from the target and the strong increase of inflation in a context of uncertainty over the degree of indexation of decisions regarding prices and wages.",
        "They also consider that there is high uncertainty about the true elasticity of inflation to the output gap as well as over the adequacy of the adjustment expected in domestic demand to reduce inflationary pressures and the external imbalance.",
        "In this context, a 50 bp increase in the reference rate leads to a low risk of excessive adjustment in the growth of expenditure and output.",
        "Finally, they believe that, should the dynamism observed in domestic demand continue, sustainability of growth could be compromised due to the high level of deficit in the current account and the weak response of exports to the real devaluation of the peso.",
        "Hence the importance of the adjustment of public spending announced by the national government, of the timely submission and approval of a structural fiscal reform, and a faster reaction of the monetary authority to the behavior of inflation and inflation expectations DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.25%.Bogotá, DUpdate 09/03/2016, 16:34",

        "Total consumption, particularly for households, reduced its growth rate, while investment deepened its fall.",
        "With this, domestic demand exhibited a negative annual variation (-1.1%), the first since 2009.",
        "On the other hand, net exports contributed positively to economic growth.The information available for the fourth quarter is still scarce, but it allows anticipating that economic activity is expanding at a slightly faster pace than in the third quarter.",
        "This is partly due to the fact that some supply shocks that took place in the third quarter would have been overcome.",
        "Should this be the case, GDP growth for 2016 would post in the lower part of the forecast range presented in the previous quarterly Inflation Report (1.5% to 2.5%, with 2.0% as the most likely figure).In the last month, commercial indebtedness (that of foreign currency adjusted to correct for the fluctuations of the exchange rate) registered a 5.7% annual increase, as in October, but lower than in previous months.",
        "The dynamics of household credit continues, with an annual growth rate close to 13%.In November, annual consumer inflation continued decreasing, reaching 5.96% thanks to the reduction in food prices, tradable goods, and regulated items.",
        "The average of the four core inflation indicators (5.74%) also continues to fall.",
        "Inflation expectations by financial analysts to one and two years and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2 and 3 years exhibited some increases versus the previous month, and remain above 3.0%.As for the external context, the Fed raised its benchmark reference rate by 25 bp in its December meeting, as expected, and suggested that there would be three more increases in 2017, more than had been expected before.",
        "The ECB modified the size, duration, and composition of its asset-purchase program.",
        "Long-term interest rates in several developed economies have remained above the levels observed between July and October this year, while headline inflation continues to increase.Regarding oil price, it has rebound in recent weeks following the agreement reached by the OPEC, which other oil-producing countries have also joined, to reduce oil production in the first half of 2017.",
        "Thus, the country’s terms of trade would have continued to improve.The emerging markets’ risk premia and currencies (including Colombia) have corrected, following the strong changes observed after the US presidential elections.The figures for global economic activity suggest that the US, Europe, and China would continue the path of moderate growth held in recent quarters.In the -term, uncertainty about the external context has increased due to the fact that the policies to be implemented by the new government in the US and the effects of Brexit, among others, are still unknown.",
        "Similarly, risks over China persist.In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually.",
        "Inflation continues to decline faster than expected, although core inflation indicators and inflation expectations to one year still exceed the target.",
        "The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue   AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed in that the process of convergence of inflation to its long-term target has strengthened in the last months.",
        "The reversion of climatic shocks and the stabilization of the exchange rate have produced an accelerated reduction of the increase in the prices of food and goods linked to international trade.",
        "In this direction, the weak growth of domestic demand and output widens the excess of installed capacity, which will induce additional reductions of inflation in the policy horizon.",
        "The weakness of domestic demand also contributes to moderate the current account deficit and thus to reduce the vulnerability of the economy.The majority of the Board Members considered that the conditions to reduce the degree of contraction of the monetary policy stance were being met.",
        "Therefore, they voted for a 25 bp reduction of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "These members of the Board stated that the benchmark interest rate is high versus its historical average and neutral rate calculations.",
        "In this context, the recent slowdown of aggregate demand and the better prospects for inflation allow for a reduction of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They highlighted the good response of financial markets to the Fed’s increase in its benchmark rate, which reduces the risk of strong devaluations that may act against the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Another factor that reduces this risk is the agreement to reduce oil production reached by the OPEC, which would stabilize oil prices in 2017.",
        "They also noted the importance of pursuing an anticipatory monetary policy, given the lags between policy actions and their effects on domestic demand and inflation.Other Board Members considered that, despite the fact that inflation is converging to its target, there are still no strong enough signals that the pace of convergence is adequate.",
        "In this regard, the most significant risks derive from the existence of several indexation mechanisms for prices and salaries, and the probable effects of the changes in the US and Europe's monetary policy on the exchange rate and the conditions for external financing of the economy.",
        "They held that it would be prudent to keep the benchmark rates stable, considering there would be relevant information on the aforementioned risks next month.",
        "This information would allow for a more precise idea of a proper, future monetary policy, which would enhance communication with the public and improve its effectiveness.",
        "They also stated that they do not consider the adjustment of domestic demand and growth to be excessive, considering that the current account deficit is still high, for which they believe the behavior of theses variables is part of the adjustment process.",
        "Some members from this group highlighted that Core inflation is still above the target, and that inflation expectations increased slightly in the last month.",
        "In this context, a reduction of the interest rates would bring about the risk of reinforcing the change in the behavior of inflation expectations, which could generate instability of the monetary policy and costs in terms of well-being DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República at today’s meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.5%.The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by four members of the Board.",
        "The three remaining Board Members voted to keep it unaltered.Bogotá,",

        "The prices of other commodities (among them coffee and coal) also decreased in the last few weeks.",
        "With this, the country's terms of trade continue with a downward trendAdditionally, there were falls in stock exchange and increases in the volatility of financial markets, mainly due to the prospects of a further weakening of emerging economies, particularly China.",
        "In Latin America, risk premia increased and currencies depreciated.",
        "The US dollar strengthened vis-à-vis most currencies in the worldThe information available on economic activity confirms the low growth of Colombia's main trading partners in 2015, and forecasts lower paces of expansion than those projected in the September Inflation Report, both for 2015 and for 2016, mainly for the countries of the region.",
        "Such countries, including Colombia, are being affected by the fall in the international prices of commodities and by the weakening of global demand.",
        "Additionally, confidence indicators have deteriorated considerably in several casesChina would continue to slow down in 2016.",
        "The slowdown in this economy would continue to have negative effects on the performance of global activity, on trade, and on international prices of commoditiesAs for developed economies, the United States would maintain a similar growth to that of 2015, driven by domestic demand, while Europe would continue its slow recovery.",
        "The Federal Reserve is expected to increase its reference rate gradually, and the European Central Bank to continue with a highly expansive policyIn a context of low dynamism in global demand and the sharp fall in the prices of oil and commodities in general observed in 2015, exports in US dollars fell 35.3% in the accumulated value to November.",
        "While the adjustment in imports has recently accelerated with annual falls above 20.0% since September, so far this year there has been a trade deficitFor all of 2015, a deficit in the current account between 6.3% and 6.7% of GDP is estimated.",
        "Part of the detriment in this indicator is due to the reduction of GDP in US dollars resulting from the effect of the depreciation of the peso versus the US dollar.",
        "For 2016, an external deficit between 5.4% and 6.5% of GDP is expected, which assumes in the baseline scenario that deterioration in exports and the adjustment of imports continues within an environment in which external financing would be lower than observed in previous years, and possibly more costlyIn the domestic context, for all 2015 the technical staff maintained its annual growth forecast at 3.0%, within a range between 2.8% and 3.2% (narrower than the previous report).",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2015, domestic demand would have slowed down, except for investment in works, while net exports would have contributed positively to growth due to the greater fall in imports than in exports.",
        "Although real interest rates of credits remained below their historical averages, they ceased falling over the past few months (except the mortgage rate).",
        "As for the labor market, a slight increase in the unemployment rate and flattening of the occupation rate (according to the seasonally adjusted series) have been observed since the middle of the yearFor 2016, the forecast for yearly growth of GDP was reduced: it is expected to register between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 2.7% as the most likely figure.",
        "Domestic demand is expected to continue slowing down, especially investment, as part of the adjustment to the new external conditions required by the economyAnnual consumer inflation stood at 6.77% at the end of 2015, surpassing market projections and those of the technical staff.",
        "In December, core inflation indicators reduced their pace of increase and their average stood at 5.43% (3 bp above the value registered in November).",
        "Along the year, the increase in inflation is basically explained by the behavior of the food (10.85%) and of tradables excluding food and regulated items (7.09%).",
        "These groups represent 54.2% of the consumer basketAccording to the survey applied to financial analysts, inflation expectations are at 4.50% to twelve months and 3.68% to twenty-four months, figures slightly lower than the data from the previous month (4.63% and 3.83%, respectively).",
        "For December 2016, analysts expect a 4.83% inflation rate.",
        "The quarterly survey of economic expectations suggests an inflation expectation of 5.35% and 4.85% to December 2016 and 2017, respectively.",
        "Expectations arising from public debt bonds are above 4.5%, and they increased compared to those calculated in DecemberThe effects of El Niño, pass-through of depreciation of the peso to prices, and the activation of indexation mechanisms on prices and salaries could keep inflation high during the first semester of the year.",
        "Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with actions in monetary policy should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In all, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate related largely to the fall in the price of oil continue exerting inflationary pressures.",
        "At the same time, inflation expectations remain high and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, exceeding that which is consistent with the decline in national income, continues to be moderated AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board emphasized that the main shocks that are currently affecting the Colombian economy (deterioration of the terms of trade and climatic factors) have been more intense and persistent than initially foreseen.",
        "The economy continues adjusting to these shocks with a moderate deceleration in economic activity, which is expected to continue throughout 2016 mainly due to an increase in domestic demand lower than the one observed in 2015.",
        "This slowdown would continue to contribute to the reduction of the current account deficit.",
        "For the closing of 2015, a slight decline in this deficit is expected (in millions of US dollars), and a further contraction of US $3 billion is expected in 2016.The devaluation of the peso, which occurred as a result of the deterioration in the terms of trade and the strong climatic shocks, pushed inflation upwards during 2015.",
        "The estimations by the technical staff suggest that they will continue doing so during the first semester of 2016.",
        "In this period, inflation may also be affected by the indexation mechanisms of the Colombian economy, which would respond to the increase in inflation that took place in 2015.In this context, the members of the Board agree that it is appropriate to continue with the adjustment of the monetary policy by increasing the types of interests necessary for the convergence of inflation expectations and projections to the target in the policy horizon, in line with a reduction of the current account deficit.The majority of the Board Members considered that it is appropriate to continue with the path of 25 bp increases.",
        "These members ratified the advantages that this path offers in terms of market predictability and efficiency in the incorporation of marginal information within an environment of high volatility.",
        "Additionally, they stressed that the mechanisms for pass-through of the monetary policy would have strengthened since the last quarter of 2015 as a result of the change in the structure of the balance of the financial system.",
        "Finally, these members of the Board mentioned that there are specific factors related to the decline of investment in the oil sector which will contribute to the reduction of the external deficit.The other Board members considered that it is necessary to increase 50 bp because they believe that the increase in inflation expectations above the upper limit of the target range as well as the indexation mechanisms of the economy pose a growing risk of persistence of high inflation.",
        "In a context of high deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, which reflects an excess of expenditure over income, additional effects of supply shocks on expectations and pricing decisions reinforce the need to accelerate the increases in the benchmark interest rate, with the purpose of anchoring expectations to the target and preserving the credibility of the monetary policy.Finally, the Board reiterated that stronger increases in the present may avoid the need for future increases in the benchmark interest rate which could coincide with a sharp slowdown in expenditure and output DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.0%.Bogotá,",

        "The CDS for Colombia exhibited a significant increase.",
        "This took place within a context in which financial markets assign a high probability for the Federal Reserve to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points in December and to another increase in the second half of 2017.Growth forecasts of the Colombian economic activity for the third quarter and for 2016 were not modified from the last report: growth for the third quarter is forecast between 1.0% and 2.2% with 1.6% as the most likely figure, and for the whole year between 1.5% and 2.5% with 2.0% as central forecast.",
        "However, the latest information available shows poor results below expectations.",
        "Thus, the likelihood that growth for the entire year will be somewhat lower than the central forecast increased.As for the financial market, the dynamics of indebtedness continues to moderate from high levels relative to output.",
        "Commercial debt continued to decelerate (5.7%), and the rate of increase for households stabilized at 13.1%.In October, annual consumer inflation completed three months falling, reaching 6.48%.",
        "In the last month, the decrease was mainly explained by the lower pace of annual adjustment for food prices, and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable behavior of the CPI for tradable goods excluding food and regulated items.Core inflation, measured by the average of the four indicators monitored by the Central Bank, lowered from 6.29% in September to 6.03% in October.In November, inflation expectations obtained from the monthly survey to economic analysts, decreased slightly in all horizons: they stood at 4.18% and 3.57% to one and two years, respectively.",
        "In contrast, those derived from public debt bonds increased for 2, 3, and 5 year terms, ranging between 3.88% and 4.15%.In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks received since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually.",
        "The dynamics of output have been weaker than had been forecast, and inflation continues to decline, although the core inflation indicators and inflation expectations to a year still exceed the target.",
        "The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue.",
        "The recent changes in the international context have led to a depreciation of the peso.",
        "The monetary policy actions undertaken so far strengthen the convergence of inflation to its target   AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agreed that the process of adjustment of the economy to the shock on income suffered since 2014 is taking place more quickly than expected, as well as the decline in the figures for headline inflation.",
        "However, there are still risks that inflation may not converge to its 3.0% target.Facing this scenario, five members of the Board voted to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged.",
        "They concluded that it was important to have more information on the possible risks on the convergence of inflation and inflation expectations to the target before starting to reduce the benchmark interest rates.",
        "One of the risks mentioned was the increased uncertainty in international markets, which could lead to inflationary pressures.Some of the members of the majoritarian group stressed the risks of maintaining a high level of indexation in the economy, which others complemented with the need for more evidence on the convergence of inflation expectations and the measures of core inflation to the target.",
        "Finally, one of them mentioned that with shocks such as those suffered by the Colombian economy, it is difficult to assess the excess of installed capacity, with the risk of changing the monetary policy stance prematurely.Two members of the Board voted for a 25 bp reduction of the benchmark interest rate.",
        "One of them highlighted that, while it is important for the trend in core inflation to consolidate before reducing the benchmark interest rate, it is also important to acknowledge that a change in the risk balance is starting to take place: i) there are clear signals of a higher-than-expected deceleration in domestic demand; ii) there is a marked slowdown of loan portfolio (particularly commercial loans); iii) as a result of the fall of inflation expectations, real benchmark interest rates have increased, and, in general terms, real loan interest rates of the financial system have also increased.Finally, another Board Member pointed out that the growth figure for the third quarter and the forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are not encouraging, and there are no sources in sight to generate growth of domestic demand higher than potential GDP growth.",
        "On the other hand, inflation forecasts for 2016 and 2017 exhibit a faster convergence to the target.",
        "S/he acknowledges that there are risks associated with the uncertainty generated by the new trade policies that may be adopted in the United States and the change in the Fed's monetary policy stance.",
        "This could create a currency depreciation scenario whose magnitude is difficult to measure, but which would be tempered by the tax reform (which consolidates the credit rating), and by the evidence that despite the recent increase of global risk the country has not experienced capital outflows DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by majority, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%.The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged was approved by five members of the Board.",

        "Some indicators available for the second quarter suggest that the US economy would exhibit a lower-than-expected dynamism despite the good performance of household consumption.",
        "With this, the market anticipates that the normalization of the monetary policy will be slower than expected.A few days before the meeting of the FED, risk aversion in international financial markets had increased, and the US dollar had strengthened.",
        "Latin American economies exhibited a small increase in risk premia and a slight weakening of their currencies.The figures for economic activity available from other countries suggest that global growth in general, and specifically that of Colombia’s main trading partners, would be low.In the euro zone, retail sales slowed down in April, and industrial production continued with a low growth level.",
        "In China, retail sales and fixed asset investment also reduced its pace of expansion in May.In Latin America, GDP data for the first quarter and activity indicators to April show a weak growth, lower than in recent years in Mexico, Chile and Peru.",
        "Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador would continue in recession (for the last two there are no recent figures available).To June 20, the price of Brent oil has remained around USD $50 per barrel.",
        "This, with the increases in the prices of other goods exported by Colombia, suggests that the terms of trade would be at levels higher than at the beginning of the year, despite the recent increases in some of the international prices of some foodstuffs imported by the country.According to the figures of the balance of payments, in the first quarter of 2016 the current account deficit was US$ 3,381 million (m), equivalent to 5.6% of GDP.",
        "Compared to a year ago, the deficit lowered both in levels as well as relative to GDP.",
        "The main corrections took place in a lower primary income deficit and a lower services deficit.",
        "The lower trade balance deficit and the greater net income from transfers also contributed to this reduction.Foreign trade information available for the second quarter indicates that both exports and imports continue falling at significant rates (-24.8% and -17.0% in April, respectively).In the first quarter, GDP exhibited a yearly increase of 2.5%, in line with the forecasts of the Central Bank.",
        "The growth of domestic demand was 1.3%, somewhat higher than expected.",
        "On the supply side, the sectors that grew the most were industry and financial services, while mining was the only one that is contracted.The figures available for retail and industry to April show a better performance of the economy.",
        "The results of different surveys point at the same direction.",
        "However, the estimates of the technical staff suggest that a good part of this better behavior is explained by the effect of Easter and the holidays.",
        "In contrast, with information to May, energy demand (total and by the industry), oil and coffee production exhibited decreases.The technical staff maintains its growth forecast for the whole year at 2.5%, within a range of 1.5% and 3.2%.In May, yearly consumer inflation reached 8.20%.",
        "The increase is mainly explained by the behavior of food, particularly perishable goods.",
        "The average of core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank moved from 6.38 in April to 6.33% in May.Inflation expectations to December 2016 obtained from the monthly survey to financial analysts increased significantly from 6.02% in May to 6.23% in June.",
        "On the contrary, expectations to twelve and twenty-four months obtained from the same survey, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years lowered.",
        "However, all expectations except those of analysts to twenty-four months (3.67%) are above 4.0%.Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with monetary policy decisions, should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In summary, the Colombian economy continues adjusting in an orderly manner to the strong shocks recorded since 2014.",
        "The current account deficit is correcting gradually, and the risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand remains moderate.",
        "Inflation has accelerated because of the depreciation of the peso, El Niño, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms AND OPTIONSFor the members of the Board of Directors, the data available for the first quarter suggest that domestic demand and output growth continue to slow down, in line with the forecast by the technical staff of the Central Bank.",
        "On the other hand, the current account deficit showed a reduction greater than anticipated.",
        "This represents a better-than-expected behavior of national income during this period, and means that there was a decline in the external vulnerability of the economy.",
        "This corresponds to an orderly adjustment to external shocks that the Colombian economy has been facing since 2014.The majority of the Board Members deemed appropriate to increase the policy interest rate by 25 bp.",
        "They consider that this increase, added to the already significant adjustment in the policy interest rate in the past, is needed to underpin the process of convergence of inflation and inflation expectations to their 3.0% +/-1 pp goal in 2017.",
        "Despite the strong shocks that have led to recent increases in inflation, previous increases in the Central Bank’s interest rate have impacted inflation expectations in the desired direction.Among the members of the Board who proposed a 25 bp increase of the policy interest rate, some stated that the high volatility of external conditions, the signals of persistence of inflation and of the activation of indexation mechanisms could pose serious threats to achieving the inflation target in 2017, which must be confronted with adjustments in the policy interest rate.",
        "In their opinion, the credibility costs of failing to achieve the inflation target in 2017 would make future disinflation much more costly in terms of output growth and employment creation.One member of the Board considered that the previous increases in the policy rate have led to enough contraction, and that there are signs that domestic demand is adjusting at a convenient pace.",
        "Additionally, this member noted that inflation expectations for 2017 have not increased.",

        "The international price of oil increased, and during the course of April to the 26, they posted on average at USD $42.7 per barrel (Brent).",
        "The prices of other commodities exported by Colombia and Latin America have also increased recently.",
        "Should these levels of international prices persist for the remainder of the year, deterioration in the terms of trade would moderate.",
        "However, some of the factors that have generated oversupply of oil continue, and inventories remain high.",
        "Therefore, the technical staff maintained an average estimate of oil in USD $35 per barrel (Brent) for all 2016The Federal Reserve of the United States, in its press release following the April meeting of the FOMC, suggested that normalization of the monetary policy would be more gradual than what was announced at the end of last year.",
        "Other central banks of developed countries also maintain a highly expansive monetary policy stanceIn the first two months of the year, the figures for foreign trade by DANE show a 31.2% fall in the value in US dollars for exports and 26.3% for imports.",
        "The deterioration in exports is expected to continue for the remainder of 2016 on account of the poor growth of trading partners, the prices of goods exported being lower than those observed in 2015, and the reduction in the volumes of some products such as oil.",
        "Imports are also expected to continue falling, in line with a lower growth of domestic demand.",
        "With this, the external deficit for 2016 would be somewhere between 5.3% and 6.4% as a percentage of GDPIn Colombia, domestic demand would have slowed down in the first quarter, particularly due to a fall in investment other than the construction of buildings.",
        "The figures available for retail indicate that private consumption continued as dynamic as in the end of last year, despite the marked deterioration in confidence indicators and the upward trend of the unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted series).",
        "Regarding public expenditure, growth is expected to have been lower than what was observed in the last quarter of last year.",
        "On the supply side, indicators of industry, retail trade, and coffee production suggest a favorable behavior, while mining reported deterioration.",
        "With this information, the technical staff is projecting a growth rate between 1.8% and 3.2% for the first quarter, with 2.5% as the most likely figureThe forecast range for the full year is maintained between 1.5% and 3.2%, but the most likely figure was revised downward to 2.5% (compared to 2.7% of the December 2015 Inflation Report).",
        "Regarding the previous quarterly report, the new estimates consider a weaker external demand and a greater decrease in investmentIn March, annual consumer inflation reached 7.98%.",
        "The increase is explained by the behavior of regulated items, tradable goods excluding food and regulated items, and processed foods.",
        "The average of core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank increased again, standing at 6.29%Inflation expectations to twelve months are above 4.5% (for the different measures monitored by the Bank) and to December 2017 at 4.08% (according to the survey to economic analysts).",
        "Two-year expectations are at 5.30% according to the quarterly survey of economic expectations, and at 3.81% according to the survey to analysts.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds exceed 4.4% for all maturitiesThe effects of El Niño, pass-through of the accumulated depreciation of the peso to prices, and the activation of indexation mechanisms on prices and salaries would keep inflation high during the first semester of the year.",
        "Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with monetary policy decisions, should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In all, high increases in food prices and partial pass-through of depreciation to domestic prices continue to exert inflationary pressures.",
        "Inflation expectations remain high.",
        "This takes place within a context of excessive expenditure over national income, in which the risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand continues to be moderated AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agree that it is still necessary to continue increasing the benchmark interest rate.",
        "The latest figure for inflation confirms the persistence of the shocks that affect this variable, although their effect on inflation expectations to different maturities has reduced marginally.",
        "Data for the external balance show progress in the adjustment of the current account deficit, but, due to the magnitude it has reached, it is necessary to continue driving this adjustment from the fiscal front in coordination with the monetary policy.The majority of the Board Members proposed a 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "Some of them consider that convergence of inflation to the target is compromised, even after the effects of the transitory shocks to prices have subsided.",
        "Supply shocks on prices have been more intense and persistent than originally foreseen; core inflation indicators show a growing annual variation, above the target; inflation expectations exceed or are close to the upper limit of the target range, and domestic demand has exhibited a dynamics higher than had been expected at the beginning of this year.",
        "Under these circumstances, expectations and indexation mechanisms are reinforcing inflation, and threaten the credibility of the monetary authority.They also considered that the excess of expenditure over income, reflected in a wide deficit in the current account, is a risk to macroeconomic stability in the future.",
        "A 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate underpins the credibility in the monetary authority, fosters convergence of inflation to the target range in 2017, and contributes to an orderly correction of the deficit in the current account, all this without increased risk of an excessive deceleration of the economy and employment creation.One of the members of the majoritarian group considers that the impacts of the supply shocks continue to exhibit greater intensity and persistence than had been initially foreseen.",
        "Also, that in the course of the year, domestic demand has been more dynamic than had been expected at the beginning of the year.",
        "Although this does not imply that there are demand pressures, confluence of these factors slows down convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Thus, there is space to increase the benchmark rate by 50 bp, continuing with the path of increases that began in September of 2015.Other members expressed that, despite the fact that they agree in that the reasons to continue increasing the benchmark interest rate persist, they prefer to continue with the 25 bp increase path.",
        "They stated that the path of gradual increases has generated credibility in the process of tightening monetary conditions and, consequently, increases in the interest rates of the financial system in amounts equal to or greater than those displayed by the benchmark rate.",
        "The proper operation of the policy's transmission channels was a result of its consistency, credibility and predictability, as was reflected by the behavior of the financial markets.They also noted that one of the greatest strengths of a gradual path of increases is the possibility to effectively incorporate new information to policy decisions.",
        "This strength becomes even more important considering that uncertainty about the future behavior of exogenous variables (which are relevant to the Colombian economy) has increased, such as the international price of oil or international financial conditions.",
        "In the last month, these variables have exhibited significant changes, with high uncertainty about their nature and duration, which would reaffirm the desirability of maintaining the path of gradual increases to the benchmark interest rate DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 7.0%.Bogotá,",

        "The most dynamic sectors were industry and financial services, while mining, agriculture and electricity, gas and water utilities reported declines.",
        "Consequently, the annual increase in GDP for the first half of the year was 2.3%.The information available for the third quarter is still scarce.",
        "With data to July, energy demand and production of coffee and oil exhibited annual falls.",
        "Variables related to household spending such as consumer confidence and the indicators for the perception of the retail sector suggest a slowdown.",
        "On the other hand, the indicators for industrial perception remained favorable.This, together with the data observed for GDP in the second quarter, suggests that it is very likely that growth of the economy for the entire year will be below the midpoint of the forecast range (between 1.5% and 3.0%) published in the June Inflation Report.In July, annual inflation stood at 8.97%, above Banco de la República's forecasts and the market average.",
        "The average of core inflation indicators monitored by the Central Bank increased from 6.52% to 6.61%.The acceleration of inflation in the last month is explained by the behavior of food (processed and perishable goods), to a large extent, associated with the trucking strike.",
        "The CPI for regulated items, on the other hand, exerted downward pressures, while the variation of the prices of tradables and non-tradables (excluding food and regulated items) was similar to June's.The most recent information from Sipsa (DANE) suggests that food prices would be falling in August compared to the levels observed in July.Annual PPI variation, particularly of the group of imported goods, suggests that cost pressures related to pass-through of the accumulated depreciation of the peso to domestic prices would be moderating.Inflation expectations from the monthly survey to economic analysts to twelve and twenty-four months remained relatively stable (4.55% and 3.72%, respectively).",
        "To 26 August, expectations from TES to two, three and five years, on average, exhibited reductions compared to data from July (9, 13 and 17 bp, respectively).",
        "For two and three years’ terms, they remain somewhat above 4.0%.Regarding the external context for the second quarter, growth in the US was below expectations, and in the euro zone it was lower than in the first quarter.",
        "China continues slowing down moderately; as for Latin America, GDP growth in Chile, Mexico and Peru was low and similar to that observed in recent quarters.",
        "In Brazil, economic activity index suggests lower falls of its output.",
        "This suggests that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners could be somewhat lower than estimated in the last quarterly report.International financial markets maintained a relatively low volatility, and risk premia for Latin America fell slightly compared to the previous month.",
        "Implicit rates for futures in the United States suggest it is likely that the next increment in the benchmark interest rate by the Fed will take place towards the end of the year.The recent behavior of the price of oil, increases in the prices of other export goods, and decreases in some of the prices imported food suggest that the country's terms of trade continued to recover in August.",
        "However, their levels remain low and lower than those in 2015.To June, Colombia's total exports have fallen 25.8% and imports 20.9%.",
        "This suggests that deficits in the trade balance and in the current account continue to adjust.In all, output deceleration has been stronger than forecast, and inflation and inflation expectations remain high, exceeding the target.",
        "The recent behavior of the prices of tradable goods suggests that pass-through of the strong recent depreciation of the peso to domestic prices is fading.",
        "Prices of food, especially perishable goods, are expected to fall during the rest of the year.",
        "This, together with monetary policy actions, should lead inflation to its target range in 2017 AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board of Directors highlighted the decline in GDP growth in the second quarter of 2016 to 2.0%, a figure lower than expected by the technical staff at the Central Bank (2.6%).",
        "The causes and consequences of this result were considered by the members of the Board to determine their position regarding the monetary policy stance.The majority of Co-Directors voted in favor of maintaining the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%.",
        "This group noted that inflation expectations remained stable and that the adjustment process of the economy to the fall in the terms of trade continues in an orderly manner.",
        "They also mentioned that monetary policy is in a contractionary stage.",
        "Likewise, they pointed out that, inasmuch as inflation continues lowering in the coming months, expectations can also be expected to reduce, given their adaptive component.Within the majoritarian group, several issues were mentioned.",
        "Some referred to the fact that the current account deficit remains high, and that the probability of an increase in the benchmark intervention rate by the FED this year is high.",
        "This may lead to a greater devaluation of the peso and an additional pass-through to the prices of tradable goods and services.",
        "One of them pointed out that the adjustment of the economy to the new external conditions faced by the country is not neutral at the time of submitting the draft of the tax reform to Congress.Finally, another member of the majoritarian group expressed his/her perception that there is a risk of a faster-than-expected slowdown in the economy.",
        "S/he added that if this takes place, a reduction to the benchmark interest rate should be considered eventually.",
        "However, this will also depend on what happens with inflation expectations.One Co-Director noted that: (a) Yearly inflation continued to increase and reached 9.0% in July, the highest in 16 years, having remained for a year and a half above the upper limit of the target range, exceeding it by 125%.",
        "(b) Among the major economies of the region (excluding Venezuela) inflation in Colombia is the highest, and among those which have implemented the inflation target strategy, it exhibits the greatest deviation from the target.",
        "(c) The average of core inflation indicators also continued increasing.",
        "(d) According to the quarterly survey of economic expectations applied in July, the credibility in the fulfillment of the inflation target in December next year, which is the deadline to return to the target according to the announcement made by the Board in November 2015, is merely 21.5%.",
        "Moreover, the Central Bank's latest quarterly survey shows that, although inflation expectations would begin to lower, they would not reach the target range in December 2017.",
        "If so, the probability that 2017 will become the third consecutive year failing to achieve the target is high, and this would seriously endanger credibility in the monetary authority.",
        "(e) The main challenge for the monetary policy at the present time is to break the persistence of deanchoring inflation expectations with regard to the target, along with complying with the commitment assumed by the Board to ensure that inflation returns to the target in 2017.",
        "Although the foreseeable reduction in the growth rate of food prices in the coming months must contribute to attenuate the increase of total inflation, it is very unlikely that with the current monetary policy stance the speed of its reduction be enough to face this challenge successfully.",
        "For these reasons, s/he proposed to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points DECISIONThe Board of Directors, by majority, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%.The decision was approved by six members of the Board; one member voted for a 25-basis point increase.",

        "For 2017, a growth rate similar to the one presented in the previous quarterly report is foreseen for the country's trading partners, showing a slight recovery compared to 2016.",
        "Thus, the momentum generated by external demand for the Colombian economy will be somewhat higher, but still weak, next year.For the remainder of the year and 2017, the terms of trade are expected to continue rising, largely due to the projected increase in the international prices of the main export products.",
        "However, the levels will remain below those of 2014.Regarding external financing, no significant increases are expected for the remainder of the year and 2017.",
        "This implies that the normalization of monetary policy in the United States would be very gradual, and that the monetary policy stance of other developed countries will remain highly expansive.",
        "However, there are upside risks on account of an increase in risk aversion, in the perception of the country’s risk, or by higher-than-expected increases in foreign interest rates.The external deficit of the country has been correcting during this year, and this trend is expected to continue in 2017.",
        "As has been observed so far, the trade balance (goods and non-factor services) would have contributed mostly to the adjustment of the external imbalance.",
        "For 2016, the deficit in the current account is estimated to be close to 4.7% of GDP, and around 3.7% for 2017.",
        "These levels are still higher than the historical average registered in the country.The reduction in the current account deficit and the slowdown of the Colombian economy reflect the adjustment required in the economy due to the negative shock to national income that the country has been facing since 2014.",
        "This slowdown has been slightly higher than anticipated in the Quarterly Report of June, partly due to negative supply shocks (trucking strike), whose effects in some sectors could not be offset in the following months.Thus, the technical staff reviewed the growth projection downwards for 2016.",
        "For the whole year, GDP growth is expected to be 2.0%, within a range of 1.5% and 2.5% (versus 2.3%, within a range between 1.5% and 3.0% in the June report).",
        "For 2017, growth is estimated to be between 1.0% and 3.0%, with 2.0% as the most likely figure.Consumer inflation has slowed down significantly in the last two months (from 8.97% in July to 7.27% in September), and has remained below the Central Bank’s and the market's expectations.",
        "This suggests that the strong transitory shocks that diverted inflation from its target are beginning to fade at a pace faster than expected.",
        "However, the measures for core inflation remain high, inflation expectations are above 3.5%, and in some cases exhibited slight increases in the last month.Given the deterioration of national income due to the fall in the price of oil, a structural tax reform that improves government income should contribute to sustained growth in the long term by reducing the risk on the country, to improve the prospects for investment, and, in general, to macroeconomic stability in the country.",
        "However, the central forecasts in this report do not include the effects of said reform.In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually.",
        "The dynamism of output has been weaker than projected, inflation has lowered, but inflation expectations exceed the target.",
        "The effects of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations have begun to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue.",
        "In this context, the monetary policy actions undertaken so far contribute to the convergence of inflation to its target AND OPTIONSAfter analyzing the most recent information on the Colombian economy and its prospects, all the members of the Board agreed to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered.In general, the Board Members agreed with the analysis by the technical staff according to which the adjustment has been faster than anticipated, particularly in regards to the current account deficit, although an additional reduction is still needed.",
        "Furthermore, they highlighted the fact that inflation measures excluding food and excluding food and regulated items have decreased, as also have the monthly core inflation indicators, although they are still high.Regarding the financial market, they also pointed out that there is a deceleration of the loan portfolio, particularly the commercial one.",
        "However, they stated that stability of rates is still required inasmuch as there is a need for a stronger anchoring of expectations to the target.Some Board Members added that, according to the models and without considering yet the effects of the tax reform, there is still a high risk of not reaching the upper limit of the target range in 2017.",
        "For this reason, convergence of inflation to the target range at the end of that year is currently the main challenge for the monetary policy, following the commitment of the Board reiterated in November 2015.",
        "As for inflation, inflation expectations, and economic growth, the most recent data show that monetary policy measures taken in the past year have been producing the expected adjustment in the economy and in prices.As for growth, some stressed that, in spite of the low growth of external demand, the exchange rate adjustment would cause net exports to contribute positively to growth.",
        "Both the increase in the terms of trade and the forecasts for the price of oil in 2017 will enhance the impact of the external sector on growth.A member of the Board added that the latest data available show an indisputable contraction of the economy in the absence of fiscal, monetary, and external stimuli.",
        "It is possible that potential GDP growth has declined.",
        "However, it is very likely that such growth be higher than the 2.0% forecast by the technical staff at the Central Bank, for which the economy could be growing faster without generating inflation.",
        "Based on this, the monetary policy stance could be modified, but this is not possible because current inflation is 7.0%, and the models forecast inflation to be above 6.0% by the end of 2016, and close to 4.0% in 2017, which justifies not changing it.",
        "Considering risk, the current orthodox monetary policy stance provides insurance, improves confidence, and allows for capital flow.",
        "However, s/he invited the Board to approach future monetary policy analysis in terms of growth DECISIONThe Board of Directors decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%.The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was reached unanimously.",
        "A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la República took place in the city of Bogotá on Friday, March 18, 2016.",
        "In attendance were Mauricio Cárdenas Santamaría, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; José Darío Uribe Escobar, Governor of the Central Bank; and co-directors Carlos Gustavo Cano Sanz, Ana Fernanda Maiguashca Olano, Adolfo Meisel Roca, Cesar Vallejo Mejia, and Juan Pablo Zárate Perdomo.These minutes contain a summary of the outlook of the technical staff of the Central Bank on the macroeconomic situation (section 1), followed by a review of the main discussion regarding monetary policy by the Board of Directors (section 2).Furtherdetail on the macroeconomic situationprepared by the technical staff from Banco de la República will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report of February and in the statistical annex CONTEXT1.In recent weeks, the international prices of oil and other commodities increased.",
        "Also, the US dollar weakened and volatility at international financial markets reduced.",
        "Among other factors, this is due to a greater provision of liquidity in advanced economies, to a prospect of a more gradual increase of the benchmark interest rate by the Fed than expected, and to the stimulus policies announced in ChinaConsistent with this and in line with other emerging economies, the value of the Colombian peso vis-à-vis the US dollar and the country’s risk premia reversed part of the deterioration observed at the beginning of the year.",
        "However, the levels of both indicators continue above the averages registered in 2015The records for global economic activity in January and February suggest that growth of Colombia's main trading partners for 2016 would still be weak and would be similar to that observed in 2015.",
        "This is due especially to the poor performance expected for Latin American economies with which the country has important trade relationsThe US economy would continue to be driven by private consumption, the euro area would maintain a slow recovery, and China would keep slowing down.",
        "In Latin America, the figures for the fourth quarter confirmed the deepening of the recession in Brazil and a modest expansion in Mexico and Peru.",
        "In Chile, the indicator of activity suggests that the expansion remains low.",
        "Growth figures have not been yet published for Venezuela and Ecuador, but leading indicators suggest contractions in their GDPIn January, the value of the country´s foreign sales in US dollars fell 36.2% on a yearly basis, exhibiting significant reductions for the different groups.",
        "At the same time, the value of imports fell 28.0%According to the latest figures published by DANE, GDP grew 3.3% during the fourth quarter and 3.1% for all of 2015.",
        "On the side of expenditure, domestic demand slowed compared to 2014 (from 6.0% to 3.6%).",
        "However, the figures for consumption and investment in the last quarter were more dynamic than had been expected.",
        "Acceleration of the tradable sectors took place in the second semester (from 0.9% in the first semester to 2.0% in the second), as well as a slight deceleration of non-tradable goods (from 4.2% to 4.0%)The few figures available for 2016 show mixed signals.",
        "On the one hand, with information to January, retail sales (excluding vehicles), cement production and dispatch, and industrial production exhibited growth, which in several cases surpassed those expected by the technical staff from the Central Bank and by economic analysts.",
        "Similarly, to February, coffee production also experienced a favorable increase, in spite of the high basis for comparisonOn the other hand, the unemployment rate showed a significant increase in January, confirming the increasing trend that began at the end of 2015.",
        "With information to February, oil production lowered, household indebtedness continued to slow down, and the consumer confidence index remained at its lowest since April 2002.",
        "Additionally, the Government cut spending for the present yearWith all of the above, the technical staff maintained its forecast range for GDP growth for 2016 between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 3.0% as the most likely figure.10.The figure for yearly consumer inflation in February posted at 7.59%, the highest since December 2008.",
        "However, monthly variation (1.28%) was lower than expected by the Central Bank and by the market.",
        "The average of core inflation indicators monitored by Banco de la República stood at 6.07%.11.Unlike the previous months, when upward pressures on inflation originated in food and tradables, the increase of inflation in February was explained by the behavior of regulated items and non-tradables excluding food and regulated items.",
        "In addition to the effects of El Niño and the depreciation of the peso on these groups, prices increases could be associated with the activation of indexation mechanisms and increased labor costs.",
        "The variation in the prices of tradable goods (excluding food and regulated items) and food remained high, but it was lower than the one observed in January.12.Inflation expectations collected from the monthly survey to economic analysts in March stood at 5.72% for December this year, 4.41% to 12 months, and 3.77% to 24 months.",
        "Those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, 5, and 10 years decreased so far in March vis-à-vis the previous month, although they remain above 4.4%.13.The effects of El Niño, pass-through of the depreciation of the peso to prices, and the activation of indexation mechanisms on prices and salaries could keep inflation high during the first semester of the year.",
        "Shocks in food prices and depreciation are expected to begin fading in the second semester, which, together with actions in monetary policy should lead inflation towards its target during 2017.In summary, a significant gap between expenditure and national income persists.",
        "High increases in food prices and the partial pass-through of depreciation to domestic prices continue to exert inflationary pressures.",
        "Inflation expectations remain high, and the risk of a slowdown of domestic demand in excess of that which is consistent with the decline in national income continues to be moderated AND OPTIONSThe members of the Board agree that it is necessary to continue increasing the benchmark interest rate.",
        "Although the increase in inflation expectations has moderated, the levels remain high.",
        "The data on the adjustment of the current account deficit show a slight improvement in millions of US dollars, but its level still requires adjusting, on which both the monetary and the fiscal policies must continue working.The majority of the Board Members considered that it is appropriate to continue with the path of 25 bp increases.",
        "They highlighted the moderation observed in the increase of inflation expectations in February, which could be reinforced with a more stable exchange rate.",
        "Also, they opined that transmission of policy rate increases to the economy is operating effectively, and they expect it to continue doing so throughout this year.",
        "As for the external adjustment, they stressed that the value of the current account deficit in US dollars lowered in 2015 vis-à-vis the value in 2014; one of the Board members mentioned that the recent upturn in the price of oil could lead the current account deficit to be even lower in 2016 than initially projected.",
        "However, as long as there are external imbalances and a gap between inflation expectations and the goal, they consider necessary that domestic demand accentuate its deceleration process and that the monetary policy continues contributing to this adjustment.The other Board Members proposed a 50 bp increase in the benchmark interest rate.",
        "They consider that there is a risk that, once the effects of the transitory shocks to prices have passed, inflation converges to a level higher than the target.",
        "This could be suggested by (i) the strong increase of core inflation indicators during the past 17 months, whose average has reached 6.1%; (ii) the activation of indexation mechanisms, with a figure for inflation of 6.77% by the end of 2015 and which posted at 7.6% in February this year; (iii) the existence of inflation expectations that, in the majority of its measurements, exceed the 3.0% goal and its control range (from 2.0% to 4.0%); and (iv) a higher-than-expected dynamism of domestic demand in an economy that shows excess spending over income, reflected in the large deficit in the current account of the balance of payments.",
        "This excess takes place in the context of an output gap close to zero and a benchmark interest rate that can hardly be assimilated to a contractionary policy stance.",
        "In their opinion, a path of stronger increases to the interest rates would have accelerated convergence of inflation expectations to the target, contributed to a greater reduction of the current account deficit, and allowed to end the cycle of increases of the interest rate earlier.",
        "Similarly, it would also have made it easier to achieve a more comfortable position to face future negative external shocks, in terms of having more controlled inflation expectations and less external vulnerability DECISIONThe Board of Directors of Banco de la República, by majority, decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.5%.Bogotá,"
