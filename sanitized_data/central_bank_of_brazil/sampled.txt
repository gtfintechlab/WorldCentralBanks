Signs of additional stimulus by monetary authorities of some developed economies contributed to stabilize financial markets and to create a relatively benign environment for emerging economies in the short term
Regarding credit to individuals, an increase in concessions is expected, boosted by the retreat in delinquency and in the household banking debt service, in the case of consumer credit; and by the competition, in the case of the housing segment
The Committee then started debating the future signaling of the conduct of monetary policy
The emerging economies, although yet in a recovery cycle after the 1997 crisis and 1998, tend to suffer the impacts of a loss of dynamism in world trade and of the higher risk aversion of investors, associated with a larger degree of world uncertainty
Furthermore, the war in Ukraine impacts the supply of natural gas, thus bringing additional uncertainty to the European economic scenario, whereas, in China, the deterioration of the real estate sector, coupled with the policy to fight Covid-19, negatively impact the countrys growth prospects
The index behavior reflected, with greater intensity, lower optimism regarding the coming months
The Committee maintained the expectation of a recovery in activity in the second half of the year, although less intense and more concentrated in the services sector
However, in some emerging countries, exchange-rate depreciation prevents further price reductions and limits the actions of their central banks
On the other hand, in economies where inflation rates are at high levels relative to their respective targets, the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more limited
The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, on the benchmark scenario, based on the 360day swap rates estimates a 173 bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 106 bps in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information
International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate
Wholesale prices in the U.S. decreased in August, as a consequence of the slowdown in the prices of oil, food and vehicles
In the month, there was no spot intervention in the domestic exchange market
The net public sector debt closed at R 527.2 billion in the month of March, corresponding to 47 of GDP
Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances and, in specific cases, non-conventional monetary policy initiatives
As in the previous month, the BCB decided not to rollover the FX debt and swaps maturing on February 11th
The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables
Copoms position is that the current real rate of interest is not neutral or, in other words, it is above the real long-term equilibrium rate for the Brazilian economy
Regarding wholesale inflation, a deceleration is also expected as anticipated by the results of the IGP-10 and the first ten-day period of the IGP-M, notwithstanding the continuity of specific adjustments due to increases in international commodity prices
Inversely, other important coincident indicators still grew in August, as in the case of vehicles and steel production
Similarly, the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in April, with the positive result of 50.3 thousand jobs
If those shocks prove to be more persistent or larger than anticipated, the Committee will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening cycle
The residential properties prices continue increasing, which, combined with the high prices of the stocks, has resulted in an increase in household wealth
Other Copom members argued that the evolution of some inflation components that are more sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary policy continue to indicate a pause, at the margin
It also bears emphasizing that, in a given period, the fiscal impulse is equivalent to the change of the structural surplus compared to the observed in the previous period
Despite the reduction of systemic risk perception, since mid-March, such difficulties could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in the quality of credit, which would reinforce the already evident trend to financial contraction, increasing the risk of slowdown intensification
However, it bears highlighting oil prices volatility, a result of low predictability of some global demand components, of dependency of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and of geopolitical complexity that is typical to the sector
The evolution of wholesale price indices, on the other hand, basically reflected the passthrough of the exchange rate
The short-term rates increased influenced by the disclosure of activity data suggesting consistent recovery of the Brazilian economy and expectations of inflation above the targeted path
The overall average tenure on credit operations reached 94 months in July, representing increases of 0.4 month, month-on-month, and 13.8 months, year-over-year
For semi- and non-durable consumer goods, the seasonally adjusted quarterly moving average series have posted the highest output level since August 2003, when these sectors resumed growth
The Committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of international commodities prices
The Committee noticed a persistent dynamism in the labor market, with real wage gains in recent months
The Copom understands that the maintenance of monetary stability is a necessary condition so that the relative prices system continues to signal efficiently the adjustments requested for ongoing consumption and production patterns in the economy
These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets
The strategy of rolling exchange securities as they mature continued in the period under analysis
Even though inflation is under control, there are growing uncertainties with respect to how long this trend will continue, despite high productivity gains
Inflation has remained at moderate levels in the US and in the Euro Zone, and in Japan, deflation is still recorded
There has been an adjustment in the extent and speed of the monetary policy tightening cycle in some advanced countries, which has led to a further tightening of financial conditions
Prices In August, the adjustment of the administered prices continued to exert pressure on the main inflation indices, albeit at a lower intensity, thus contributing to lower monthly changes as compared to July
The BCB maintained in its open market operations the 3-month fixed and the 2-week indexed repurchase operations, as well as the daily liquidity management operations, with tenor of two working days
The inflation high was caused by depreciation of the euro and increases in international petroleum prices
In the seasonally adjusted statistical series, production and imports of capital goods expanded by 2.3 and 14 in January, respectively, as against 2.7 and -11.3 in the preceding month
Following the July and August supply shocks when inflation neared three percentage points in the two month period, the September and October results point to a rapid downturn and an accumulated rate of just 0.4 percentage points in the period
Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration
Based on new information, the Committee judges that those conditions no longer hold, as inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are sufficiently close to the inflation target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy
NBCE were offered on three occasions for purposes of rolling maturing exchange securities
In short, the set of available data indicates a heated labor market, although with some signs of moderation at the margin
Investment expansion and imports growth have contributed to retard this process, limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained growth
They evaluated that, despite the partial reduction in governmental emergency transfer programs, the economic recovery has been better than expected
Some industrial categories which manufacture intermediate goods are operating close to their full installed capacity
Oil prices, a systematic source of international uncertainty, not only remained at historically high levels but also continued highly volatile
The lower growth rate of the PEA in the recent past has contributed to stability, at low levels, of the unemployment rates, despite the moderation in the pace of job creation
In contrast, the central bank of Indonesia increased its basic interest rate
Disbursements to the manufacturing sector expanded by 4.7 in the year and 10.5 in the 12-month period ended in the month of March
They assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable levels, and that inflation projections indicate a convergence of inflation to target over the course of 2019 and This path is consistent with inflation expectations, which remain anchored
Out of the ten sectors surveyed, eight sectors performed positively month-on-month in November
Defaults in the private financial system closed December at 4.3 and have declined steadily from a May level of 5.4
The existence of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors suggests that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion can be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions, added up to imports penetration increase
Regarding regulated prices, the negative change was due to the reduction of fuel prices, which prevailed over the increases of water and sewage tariffs and bottled gas prices
In Japan, the Tankan indicator increased for the fifth consecutive month, registering a record high since In Europe, business confidence remained flat, although consumer confidence increased
However, the Brazilian economy remains sound and shows greater resilience to face the international markets turmoil
For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity
The US economic activity, for instance, has shown signs of stabilization in household consumption and in the housing market
Recent indicators show a worse composition
The recent behavior of international petroleum prices, despite the production cuts announced by OPEC, suggests a weakening of the upward price trend started two years ago
The Committee evaluates that the global inflationary scenario is still challenging
In emerging economies, in general, monetary policy bias is expansionist
including those of fiscal nature, presents itself as both a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing room for the beginning of a process of gradual and disinflationary process
Since inflation remains relatively high, it is still premature to conclude that inflation persistence is definitively decreasing and that the effect of the exchange rate appreciation on prices is significant
Parallel to this, since fuel increases occurred in the second half of July, part of the impact will still be felt in terms of August inflation
In this context, the assessment of purchase managers, expressed by the global PMI, fell for the fourth consecutive month, reaching 50.3 points in June, the lowest level of the last three years
These considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative prices, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the last months of 2008 and in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity
The most recent data indicate that although investment has been contributing to soften the trend of increasing capacity utilization rates, it has not been sufficient to stop this process
Some members of the Committee emphasized that there was an increase in longer-term expectations in much of the emerging countries, reflecting the magnitude and persistence of the global shocks still underway
High unemployment rates in Europe, coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties, are translated into investments decline and low growth
In line with the positive developments in labor market, and with the expansion of credit, retail sales continue to record positive performance
For those members, the resilience of activity and the strength of the labor market suggest lower elasticity of the output gap to the monetary policy, which could lead to an even slower disinflation process
Recent changes in relative prices, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation targets, without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken place
Unemployment held steady at 4.0
The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics is still characterized by a process with two distinct stages
In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating considerably, inflationary pressures have reduced fast
The PMI indicator for the industrial sector indicates contraction of the Brazilian production in April
However, the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain fragile, with uncertainty regarding growth and deflationary risks in major developed economies
LFT placements with a total value of R 13.5 billion were held on four different occasions, while redemptions added up to R 18.5 billion
For the Committee, supported on positive data recently released, the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have remained
The combination of such that the economy continued to show signs of factors recommended waiting until the next Regarding the global outlook, the Committee path for regulated prices and its effects on the members pointed out the risks associated with the prospective scenario for inflation
Money Market and Open Market Operations Over the past weeks, there has been high volatility in the yield curves
The manufacturing industry showed positive balance of 74.6 thousand jobs, the seventh consecutive month of expansion and the best result of the series for the month
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations decreased in October, reaching 456 days, down from 458 days in September
The labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin
The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over households confidence and consumption
On its turn, the Japanese economy cannot overcome deflation and recovers at a slow pace, led by exports
Retail sales sustained positive, though decreasing, rates when compared to those of the same period of the previous year
At this stage, however, it is particularly difficult to project the output gap, in an environment of a sharp expansion of demand, as has been observed in the last few quarters
The Committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment
Notwithstanding this risk, the Copom members considered that the The Copom assessed that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks on both sides
High unemployment rates for a long period, coupled with the implementation of fiscal adjustments, the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature economies
The risks are likely to persist as long as a tight labor market is observed in several advanced economies
Despite the dominant opinion still seems to point out to a transitory, but possibly intense deceleration, the negative assessments have become more disseminated
Tradable prices contributed with 0.12 p.p., mainly due to increases in the prices of sugar and new and second-hand cars
In general, the recent evolution of these indices signals reduction of the pressures stemming from wholesale prices over consumer prices
The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, by those referring to the significant worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the monetary policy stance change
In March, inflation measured by the main price indices will continue to fall although it will remain at high levels compared to the average for this month in previous years
GDP growth was adjusted according to recent data released by IBGE
The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process
The Committee considers that, in part, such regulatory changes should materialize as an element of aggregate demand constraint through the credit channel, as well as by the reduction of incentives to the adoption of strategies such as the simple broadening of contract tenures, among others
This has so far relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy
However, during periods of disinflation, nominal interest rates are expected to fall gradually, and therefore forecasts for relatively long time horizons based on constant nominal interest rates tend to overestimate the downward trajectory of inflation
Risks around the global scenario have increased
In December, the manufacturing PMI grew to 55.2, the highest value since July 2006, when it had recorded 55.In China, economic activity remains sound, with exports growing in a steady way, boosted by the high in the sales destined the to Euro Zone
Due to the intrinsic uncertainty and the very nature of this variable, the Committee reinforced that the neutral rate is not a variable to be updated at a high frequency and that it is not expected to register abrupt movements either, except in exceptional cases
With respect to the labor market, data indicate a trend toward recovery with no significant pressure on costs
The Copom also thinks that the persistence of a significant mismatch between the growth paces of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary dynamics, but evaluates that the expected trajectories of domestic consumption and investment have become more uncertain
Investment indicators have expanded in recent months, particularly under capital goods output
This importance tends to broaden as the recovery of employment and real payroll lead to higher consumption
On this subject, some members evaluated the possibility of incorporating some increase in the neutral interest rate, towards the movement observed in longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey
In the first two, these papers were negotiated with terms of four years, while the third offer was placed with a five year term
The IBGE released data for Q1 2009 GDP
Industrial output was 8.4 higher than in February 1999, while new housing starts expanded by 2.4, utilizing the same basis of comparison
Further increases of fuel-alcohol prices, the readjustment of gasoline prices announced on November 26, and the urban bus fare increases in Recife and Belo Horizonte should be emphasized
In short, evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing the last months, showing a reduction in the idle margin of the industry, accompanied by the resume of investments
Out of this total, there was the creation of 61.5 11 thousand jobs in the services sector, 42.2 thousand jobs in civil construction, 37.5 thousand jobs in manufacturing industry and 12.3 thousand jobs in the agricultural and livestock sector; while 36.3 thousand jobs in commerce were eliminated
On the other hand, the Copom highlights that the significant monetary policy easing process that has been implemented since January, will have cumulative effects over the economy and will be evidenced after some time lag
The Committee believes that the best contribution of monetary policy continues to be in combating inflationary pressures and smoothing out economic fluctuations
The production of agricultural equipment in the last few years has improved with the continuous expansion in grain crops, as well as other agricultural products, a _Information for unrestricted disclosure
Regarding the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a faster pace, with data confirming the acceleration of a process of distension in this market
Despite the restrictive monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the cycle of monetary easing is already being transmitted to the credit market
Regarding metal commodities, we highlight the advance in the price of tin and decline in the price of iron ore
In the first quarter, foreign sales expanded by 1.7 and imports by 10.9 in relation to the same period of 1999,  as the foreign trade sector has shown increasingly clearer signs of improvement since February
Consumer price indices will come under some upward pressure from the prices of rice, milk and dairy products and clothing prices
CNI indicators showed smooth recovery of industrial activity in May
However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which has been more intense and longer than anticipated, as companies and households confidence strengthen, the activity pace tends to intensify
The BCB also conducted very short-term operations, in 27 opportunities as a borrower and 5 as a lender of resources, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days
The Committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depend on the strengthening of companies and households confidence
It was noted that, if these movements are persistent, the resulting inflationary impacts may be significant and will be duly incorporated by the Committee
In the period extending from May 24 to June 19, the monetary impact of definitive operations with Banco Central securities was contraction of R 0.9 billion, while operations for which the National Treasury is liable had an expansionary impact of R 1.9 billion
In short, recent data indicate that, although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization rates, the maturation of investment projects has not been sufficient, until now, to significantly limit existing mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand
In the same period, the BCB conducted 29 borrowing overnight repo operations
The prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets remained relatively stable and, overall, prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable
In short, available information suggests some persistence of inflation, which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector and, in the short run, the realignment process of regulated prices
All Committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable way
The dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial conditions, favored, among other factors, by the policies of official banks
Once the central scenario had been presented, simulations were made of the different economic models based on alternative scenarios
Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2010 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected
In fact, pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging economies, many of which are in the midst of monetary tightening cycles
For the prospective scenario, Copom discussed more thoroughly the determinants of services inflation
This intensification of the disinflation process relies on an adequate global environment
In the beginning of December, the Central Bank resumed the purchase of foreign currency
Hence, the Committee concluded that possible new interest rates reductions would demand The Copom members debated on the level of caution and additional gradualism
In emerging economies from Southeast Asia, that are more dependent upon exports, local central banks have performed cuts in their policy rates in an attempt to mitigate the impact that the negative expectations about the worldwide economy have over their local industrial production
The options to raise the base interest rates by 0.25 p.p
Although fiscal and monetary stimuli have limited the risks of a deeper activity contraction, the dominant expectation still indicates a more consistent recovery only from 2009 on
The reason underlying this conclusion is that improvement in the climate of confidence in the economy also encourages greater participation of the labor force
The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus, but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small
The shocks identified are practically the same as those delineated at the previous Copom meeting
In this context, the reduction of inflationary pressures continues to require the commitment and determination of central banks with the control of inflation through a more prolonged tightening of financial conditions
There are solid evidence of a smaller inflation inertia in the Brazilian economy in recent years
Nuci also grew 1.4 p.p
Thus, in the case of a negative shock, action should be taken to let the deviation from target be only temporary
In this environment, there have been signs of reduction in risk aversion, but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to reversals
On the other hand, capacity utilization in the intermediate goods industry remained flat in the period, in the range between the average and the historical peak, an interval much narrower than in other sectors
Overall, the Committee assessed that the updated activity projections are in fact stronger for the year
GDP may close the first quarter of 2003 roughly stable in comparison to the previous quarter
For housing credits, despite the demand at levels higher than those observed from July to September 2012, the expected approval of new lines tends to be similar to the previous quarter
In this environment, there are signs, albeit incipient, of reduction in risk aversion, but the return of confidence remains fragile, due to the susceptibility of the markets to the flow of economic and non-economic news
Reflecting the cooling of the domestic industrial growth, imports of raw material _Information for unrestricted disclosure
In the short run, inflation should reflect significant temporary upward pressures stemming from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price changes
For fuels and lubricant, the import reduction, due to the contraction in economic growth, might be mitigated by the necessity to substitute electric energy for energy generated from oil by products
The Committee will monitor the different measures of exchange-rate pass-through to both inflation and underlying inflation
Regarding the external component of aggregate demand, the scenario of greater global growth, combined with the depreciation of the BRL, contributes to make this component more favorable to the Brazilian economy growth
The main risks continue to relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy
The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and GDP growth rates continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential
In the that the approval and implementation of reforms end, the understanding prevailed that the focus on notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the best possible decision, given the set of the Brazilian economy are fundamental for the information available at the time, results, over time, sustainability of the environment of low and stable in greater credibility for monetary policy
In relation to February, industrial production fell by 1 and the pace of annual growth declined to 4.7, as against 8.4 in the previous month
Finally, pressures persist in volatile components such as food and fuel prices and especially electricity fares, due to factors including the exchange rate, commodity prices, and adverse weather conditions
In other words, neither of these scenario for the sensitivity of services inflation to factors is a necessary nor sufficient condition for an the economic activity
Moreover, formal jobs creation remains at strong levels and there is still a high proportion of voluntary layoffs
Among the factors underpinning this movement, it bears highlighting the disclosure of still more pressured current inflation indices, including the various core measures, the maintenance of inflation projections at high levels and expectations of agents regarding the start of the 12 monetary tightening cycle by the Central Bank
Regarding the global economy, the data already Short-term inflation seems to be cooling after Julys available for the 2020Q2 GDP did not surprise, but it sharp increase
Viewed over a twelve-month horizon, growth in the general price index - 10 IGP-10, general price index - market IGP-M and general price index - domestic supply IGP-DI closed at February levels of 18.03, 16.78 and 14.96, respectively, as compared to December results of 20.09, 20.1 and 19.98, in the same order
The current conditions of world growth have negatively impacted Brazilian exports as to what demand and prices are concerned
However, it considers that the high level of inflation in twelve months and the inflation expectations distant of the objectives of the inflation targeting regime do not allow monetary policy easing
In terms of the trajectory of consumer inflation over 2023, it should be noted that a relevant drop is expected in the twelve-month inflation during this second quarter, due to the base effect of the previous year
Such easing is also noticeable in Latin America, where the central banks in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil and Peru have continued the cycle of interest rate reduction
As a result, the Copom members concluded that the current scenario ceased to prescribe an extraordinary degree of stimulus, and that the Copom should begin a process of partial normalization of the policy rate
At this moment, the Copoms baseline scenario indicates that a partial normalization of the policy rate remains appropriate to keep some degree of monetary stimulus during the economic recovery
In fact, this process of delay on the normalization of monetary policy has been verified in the major part of mature and emerging economies
The volatility of international oil prices has worsened
In important emerging economies, however, the activity pace has not matched the expectations, despite the resilience of domestic demand
Short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation Returning to the domestic economy, recent persistence
The process of rebalancing the consumption basket, and, consequently, relative prices, between goods and services continues, with moderation in the consumption of goods in favor of greater demand in the services segment
This assessment is supported by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, despite at a moderate pace, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin
It is necessary to monitor possible impacts of higher uncertainty on the prospective path of inflation
The recovery in the Euro Area is uncertain, besides being slow and uneven across its economies, partly due to the fiscal consolidation and the difficulties experienced by the credit market
The Copom members then debated the level of economic slack
The Committee judges that the current scenario demands patience and serenity in the conduct of monetary policy
The BoE increased it assets acquisition program by 75 billion, to 275 billion, and the BoJ extended the deadline to the adhesion and the effective period of easing of eligibility conditions for the participation in the program of funds provision to the institutions located in calamitous areas
They concluded that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, is the best way to keep inflation on path towards the targets
The Committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current scenario, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions
Monetary Policy Guidelines Positive expectations regarding the Brazils economic performance in 2001 and 2002 contributed to the appreciation of the Real as well as to the reduction in Brazils risk
Regarding metal commodities, it bears highlighting the advance in the price of iron ore and the decline in the price of aluminum
Despite the negative retail sales results, the monthly FecomrcioSP survey showed a recovery in consumer confidence for the third consecutive month in June, signaling better prospects for the sector
This reduction, however, can be attenuated by the substitution of domestic supply by imported goods
This way, contrasting to what had happened in recent times, the net redemption of competitive debt was not significant
The low predictability of the asymmetric rebound of global economy, the dependence of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and the geopolitical complexity of the sector add uncertainty to oil prices forecasts
Even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since mid-2007, the Committee believes, according to information available at the moment, that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflationary scenario, evaluation corroborated by the recent upgrade to investment grade of Brazilian sovereign debt bonds
However, a reduction in the participation rate was observed
Industrial sales growth surpassed industrial production growth for the third consecutive month
By remaining ready to act as the balance of risks to inflation dynamics so requests, the Committee believes that it is, in fact, helping to sustain economic growth, which requires stability, predictability and consequent extension of the planning horizon for businesses and families, as well as to protect the substantial increases in real income of workers observed in recent years
The Copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion, which had already been observed and tends to persist
They concluded in favor of signaling, conditionally, that if the outlook evolves according to the Copoms baseline scenario, and due to the stage of the easing cycle, a moderate reduction in the robust balance of payments, low inflation recovery of the economy acts in the opposite environment, anchored expectations and prospect of direction, by gradually pushing inflation towards economic recovery
However, available information scenario suggests that the impact of this drop in confidence on economic activity has been The uncertainty regarding the evolution of limited so far
In the first public offer, three year papers were offered, moving to four year securities in the remaining offers
In this regard, the Committee will continue to monitor, on the one hand, the process of withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus in advanced economies and, on the other hand, the Chinese reopening process
The Committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over time
The performance of retail activity reflects consumer perceptions
Data from CNI and from the Federation of Industries of So Paulo State Fiesp confirm a continuous expansion in the level of employment and in the real payroll in the manufacturing industry
In particular, they highlighted possible implications of the current scenario for the sensitivity of inflation especially in the service sector - to the level of economic slack, as well as for inflation dynamics in particular its inertial component
One group was in favor of a more parsimonious interest rate reduction
In the case of the secondary market, the National Treasury held two LTN purchase auctions with the objective of lessening the concentration of redemption volumes
These developments can be attributed to fiscal concerns in mature economies, notably in Europe
Regarding inflation, the Committee members mentioned results that printed above expectations in the short term, and the increase in projections for In this sense, they reasoned that the ongoing disinflation process has been evolving at a speed that is below the one pursued by the Committee
Copom assesses that there is a possibility of reversion, even if partial, of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency
On three different opportunities, two year NBCE were offered
A reduction in the slope of the term interest rate came along with a lower exchange rate pressure and a drop in Brazils risk
However, the projected inflation for 2004 and 2005 are below the February results for the same exercise, due to the substitution of the lower figure effectively observed for the expected inflation of the Top 5 forecasters for the month of February, to the reduction of expected inflation by those institutions for March and to the reasons mentioned in the paragraph above, regarding the GDP performance in 2003, the reduction in the projection for the regulated prices for 2004 and the downwards improvement of the 12-months-ahead inflation expectations
Utilizing Teledata figures, based on information gathered in 10 different cities, the default rate closed at 2.1, as against 2.4 in April 1999
Relatively to investments in the country, the index which takes into account domestic absorption of capital goods and production of inputs to the civil construction declined at the end of the first half of 2001, even though indices accumulated in 2001 still show growth
The Copom evaluates that emerging local inflationary pressures are more likely to represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory, because the heated demand can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation
Finally, in the balance of risks, besides the factors already mentioned, the Committee evaluates that the probability of the most extreme scenarios for the public debt trajectory has reduced, but also noted that there was no relevant change in the inflation projections since expectations did not change significantly
Business confidence remained positive, favoring the increase in output
Inflation remains at low levels in the advanced economies; and, in the emerging ones, it stands at high levels
The Copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand and market of factors, in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some sectors, can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation
Regarding the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom highlights that the narrow idleness margin in the labor market has eased at the margin, with some data indicating the start of a process of distension in this market
This process is supported not only by traditional sources of credit, but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial institutions
On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures
This movement is already seen, to some extent, and is already partially incorporated in the longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey, as well as in the prices of several domestic assets
The weaker performance of these economies has reflected in the descending trajectory of price indices, which have also been responding to lower oil prices
Once it had been incorporated into the different forecasting estimates available to Copom, the new information contained in more recent price indicators resulted in a downward revision of the expected 2000 inflation figures
A scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rate increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus
In this sense, lower volatility in the exchange rate tends to minimize such a defensive behavior
Agricultural commodity prices reversed their downward trajectory in February, due to worse than expected harvests
Copom sustained its usual governance of incorporating the policies already sanctioned by law, but it acknowledges that the implementation of the proposed fiscal package could reduce the upside inflation risk
Despite the continuous fall in agriculture prices, industrial prices showed sharp increase in the period
Specifically, the US economy seems to have entered a process of economic stagnation since the last quarter of 2007, and still suffers the impact of the crisis in the real estate sector, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, in combination with higher oil prices, affects consumer confidence, contributing importantly to depress consumption
The Committee hightlights that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation, as well as in its composition, impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections
Copom recalls that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate, and that it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment to the domestic inflationary dynamics
Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, or through the transportation costs for industry, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations
Regarding credit to individuals, the analysis indicates stability in the pace of credit approval destined to consumption and slight reduction to housing credit
Price increases are more widespread and also include items more associated with core inflation
The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, mainly, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment
A more accentuated reduction in capacity utilization may be reflecting the lagged reaction of employment to the pace of economic activity and the effect of the energy crisis
Indicators and information available after the temporary halt in the transportation sector that occurred at the end of May 2018 point to the continuation of economy recovery of the Brazilian economy
in durable consumer goods, 1.6 p.p
The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last years
It represents the fourth consecutive monthly increase, and the recent recovery was mainly favored by the greater optimism of consumers regarding the future of economy
Consumer credit, that was displaying growing rates until October, recorded stability in November
The BCB decided not to rollover the FX debt and swaps maturing in January and in the beginning of February
Considering industrial segments, only pharmaceuticals and veterinary products expanded, 3.6 p.p., year-over-year
The scenario marked by a sound U.S. economy and resilient inflation permeates the debate on the sources, challenges, and uncertainties for the future disinflationary process in that country
Therefore, evidence suggests that the utilization rates have accommodated at high levels, and that the maintenance of the reduced idleness margin is the result of the recent economic activity expansion, still not totally offset by the maturity of completed and ongoing investment projects
Some measures of underlying inflation were considered to be at comfortable levels while others at low levels
Other monetary policy instruments are only complementary
In emerging economies, in general, the monetary policy bias is expansionist, which combines, in some cases, with other countercyclical policies
For example, there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to long-term equilibrium and, therefore, the effects of demand pressures and the high level of utilization of the factors on the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool down
In the FX markets, there is a consensus about the continuity of the dollar depreciation due to the increasing U.S. current account deficits
Approximately 58 of the revenues of the two sales were liquidated through the use of securitized credits for which the National Treasury was liable
All members concluded that such sizable, one-off and unusual fluctuations do not have relevant implications for the conduct of monetary policy
As with activity, the Committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic sectors
Nevertheless, other groups also showed a reduction of inflation pressures
Similarly, prices of international agricultural commodities and domestic food prices, which also contributed to disinflation throughout 2023, no longer suggest downside pressures with the same intensity in the next quarters
In April, employment in the manufacturing sector increased, while real payroll registered a slight decrease, although it kept in an upward trend
The Fed recognized that, although the interbank market functioning has improved, there are relevant difficulties in other markets, and credit conditions became more restrictive, in general
Labor markets in the industrialized economies continue to weaken with unemployment rates at high levels
On Regarding current inflation, the Committee the other hand, the process is long and involves members mentioned the favorable results in the uncertainties
The final impact on those markets will be greater the longer the higher interest rates last, which could lead to reallocations in the debt rollover process
Additionally, the Committee believes that this improvement in the perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity pace, both domestic and external, in this and in the upcoming semesters
Prospective assessment of inflation trends  An evaluation of the inflation outlook required identification of shocks with potential for generating impacts on future price level trajectories
The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, based on the 360-day swap rates, on the baseline scenario, estimates 103 bps and 5 bps spreads for the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, respectively
However, most of the committee members judged that this interpretation still seems premature and needs further corroboration by data
In relation to the macroeconomic environment considered in the December Inflation Report, the major difference is elimination of the doubts that had generated considerable wariness within highly computerized sectors of the economy as regards transition to the new century
The perception of economic slack for an extended period, along with the communication of central banks of major economies, creates an environment of liquidity and return of capital flows, favorable to emerging economies
The recovery, at the margin, in the dynamism of industrial production, led by production of durable goods, although more widespread than before, reflects, to a great extension, tax exemption measures and also some easing in credit conditions
Compared to July 2011, the rate decreased 0.9 p.p
The global outlook remains challenging, with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this year
The Committee perceives the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations
It shall be stressed that the yen has shown appreciating trend vis-a-vis the American dollar inasmuch as the perspectives for longer deceleration in US become more evident
There is no mechanical relationship, however, between the global outlook and monetary policy
The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector in expansionist position
The outlook remains uncertain, however, and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth persist
between inflation expectations calculated by the Focus survey and the projections produced by the Monetary Policy Committee for the current year
On its turn, exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the BRL
The current lack of liquidity conditions and further deterioration of growth prospects are set to be the most likely scenario for the short and medium term, which contributes for the global financial system to remain under severe stress
This drop in the projection continues to be a consequence of the exchange rate appreciation observed in recent months
Notably, it might contribute to additional Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA reductions of inflation expectations and components that are most sensitive to the inflation in other sectors of the economy
Consumption and credit indicators confirm the outlook for strong improvement in the level of activity over the course of 2000 but do not constitute a source of inflationary pressures
Similar behavior has been observed when analyzing the trend of market prices
For 2014, in both scenarios, the inflation forecast is slightly above the midpoint inflation target
International liquidity and markets stability remain tied to macroeconomic conditions in the industrialized countries, especially the United States, and to the possible response of the Feds monetary policy to these economic developments
Despite the tight monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that a transmission of the monetary policy cycle expected by the market to the current rates of new credit grants is already taking place, leading, in particular, to greater dynamism in the capital market in the recent period
According to the market scenario, 2014 IPCA inflation forecast decreased, but is above the midpoint inflation target
The strong demand in the last months has had an impact on the trade balance with imports growing at a faster pace than exports
Industrial output increased by 3.1 in December and 4.4 in January, when compared to the same months of 1998 and 1999
It is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial prices
The deceleration in the US economy, the financial and capital markets swings and the effects of commodities prices rises increased the risk of deceleration in global economy
These distortions may not be completely eliminated with the application of usual seasoning adjustment procedures and tend to diminish February 2004 results and increase those of March
Finally, some members argued that the eventual There are risks that are inherent to the conduct end of the benign period for emerging economies monetary policy so that inflation projections, they may constitute both a risk and an opportunity
The baseline scenario for inflation and economic activity did not differ substantially from what was projected
This was mainly due to unfavorable performance of food prices
Out of the items related to the current situation, demand level, mainly domestic, and current situation of business continue to present favorable evaluation
As the initial monetary impulse loses momentum, and the economic recovery process begins to be sustained on its self-propagation mechanisms, it is natural and sound that, at the margin, production and sales growth rates decelerate
They discussed the risks respectively
The risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments, but show significant easing at the margin
Nevertheless, they believe estimate of its extension, a possible acceleration of that the Brazilian economy nowadays shows greater the pace is equivalent to greater frontloading of the capacity to respond to occasional negative cycle
Another possibility, albeit with lower impact on short-term changes, would be a higher neutral interest rate
From January to May, the trade balance registered a surplus of US 601 million, reducing the accumulated 12 month deficit to US 132 million
Notwithstanding expectations of lesser primary surpluses in the final months of the year, 1999 fiscal performance has been quite satisfactory and easily surpassed the targets defined in the economic program agreed upon with the IMF
With respect to the rate of exchange, the process of valuation of the nations currency that began in December was confirmed in average terms in the first half of January
Depending on the magnitude of such effects, the risks to the Brazilian economy stemming from future developments of the United States economy may offset each other
The Copom evaluates that, at the start of the year, inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply shocks, as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments
and 0.08 p.p., respectively, while the 2-year rate decreased 0.13 p.p
On the other hand, the Committee notices that the significant monetary policy easing, implemented from January to July, will have cumulative effects over the economy, which will be evidenced with a time lag
The Committee has been carefully pondering that international oil prices face a more adverse environment than the current one, but still regard it as a potential risk, though increasingly higher, for the materialization of the benchmark scenario
In fact, 305 thousand jobs were created in April and 962 thousand in the year through April
The forecast for 2005 remained unaltered
The Copom evaluates that the loss of strength on domestic demand should result in reduction of inflationary pressures
Conversely, important products in the consumer basket registered new price falls in August, including rice, black beans and soy oil
External shocks should be tackled only in the The Committee reiterates that economic secondary impact they may have on prospective conditions prescribe accommodative monetary inflation
In the absence of inflationary pressures, the basic interest rates remained steady in the central economies, except for the United Kingdom, where there was an increase of 25 b.p of the Bank of Englands repo rate
Prospectively, it is plausible to affirm that the announcement by Chinese authorities of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities prices
The most recent current crisis it moved to all countries, along with the readings of price indices showed significant pandemic
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates, increased in October for the second consecutive month, reaching 377 days
This low level of inertia was noted in the wake of the final quarter of 1999 and would now seem to be repeating itself, even though the economy as a whole is clearly in a stronger growth trajectory
In Argentina, the government has seek to revert negative expectations regarding the overall economy, while the countrys aggregate demand and industrial output has remained at low levels
The accumulated 12-month rates closed at 6.95, 8.04, and 7.86 in the month of February, viewed against corresponding December figures of 8.64, 9.12, and 8.94
These surveys also perceived a better prospect in terms of domestic demand
In December, this ratio had closed at 2.9
Copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information The Copoms inflation projections in the scenario and indicators
This is the only way to retain the disinflation gains obtained during 2003, not endorsing price increases in the sectors that benefited from the rebound in demand to contaminate overall inflation
This figure results from a model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation and the IGP change; e. However, general price indices have shown relatively higher rates
This is not unexpected, considering the relatively small share of the external sector on the Brazilian GDP
This difference can be explained by the low volume of public offerings and also the interest rate variation in the month
The second scenario The Committee also discussed the conditionalities assumes continuity of the strength exhibited in recent that would prescribe stimulative monetary policy
For the Committee, the trend for global activity shows more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant horizon
The Copom evaluates that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this year, compared to 2013, as well that, in the medium term, important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and demand
This applies to the favorable food supply shock and to the positive dynamics in prices of industrial goods, but also to potential inflationary relative price adjustments
Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the accumulated impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken
These auctions were used to fully rollover principal and interest payments due in maturing instruments in April19
The BCB also borrowed money through 30 overnight repo operations and conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day-tenure liquidity management operations
Regionally, 9 out of 27 Federation units reached positive results in July
Oil prices have fallen in the last weeks, but the market has remained volatile and lacking a clear trend, still representing a risk to price stability and to the global economic growth
This favors the continuity of adequate external financing of the current account balance, even in the context of lower direct investment flows
The IPC-DI acceleration in December was mainly influenced by the higher increases in the prices of food group, whose contribution to the monthly index increased from 0.13 p.p
This reflects the impact of both the international scenario and the energy crisis on expectations and domestic economy
Three selling offers of fixed income securities, with five-month tenure, were placed between June 20th and July 17th
They assessed that those economy is essential to the reduction of its structural measures are at appropriate levels, and that inflation interest rate
Rollover rates continue to recover, although they are at a reduced level, which contributed to negative FX flows in the first days of March
On the other hand, the deceleration of global economy has generated downturn pressures over wholesale prices, despite the exchange rate adjustment
While imports of fuels and lubricants expanded as a result of price growth, foreign purchases of raw materials were pressured by growth in the volume of imports
It is monetary authorities of some developed worth noting that the same does not occur under produced downward revisions in growth forecasts under the reference and market scenarios point to for the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone
The latter figure reflects growth of 0.4 in the production of consumer durables and 2.9 in semidurable and nondurable consumer goods
This highly adverse price shock has shown that it will be with us for some time to come and the probability of new highs will increase as winter in the northern hemisphere approaches
These elements contribute to the debate on the nature of inflationary pressures and, potentially, on the pace of monetary easing to be adopted by advanced economies
The evolution of price indices does not evidence existence of inflation pressures, enabling interest rate reduction
By sector, it is important to note the continuous expansion in the production of machinery and agricultural equipment, due to the increase in the income of the agricultural sector and the significant decrease in energy generating equipment
This percentage reflects the variations in the labor market after the minimum wage adjustment in May
In the period from December 19 and January 15, the Central Bank fully rolled the maturing exchange securities, including updated principal and final interests
above the observed in the same period of 2006 and 1.2 p.p
In the global economy, a scenario of low growth prospects in important advanced economies prevail, notably in the Euro Zone, and volatility indicators have responded to the prospects of monetary policy change in the US
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates reached 452 days, up from 448 days in June
The volume of capital goods imports declined by 7, based on information available up to April
Therefore, this easing of the monetary policy reflects the necessary caution in the administration of the risks between inflation and the continuity of the restore of the economic activity
In the same period, the BCB conducted 35 overnight repo operations, borrowing
In particular, some members assessed that some uncertainty persists among agents about overcoming fiscal challenges, evidenced in primary balance expectations that diverge from the targets set by the government, and that this may also be reflected in unanchored inflation expectations for longer maturities
With the substantial fall in the prices of oil and agricultural commodities, and the increase of unemployment, the inflationary process already records turning points in the majority of mature economies
For the next quarters, the continuity of the current expansion cycle of retail sales is expected, and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income growth, credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high levels
A slower normalization constitutes a downward risk to these projections
The Copom analyzed service price inflation and its components
After a long period of expansion, domestic demand has started to exert a contractionist influence over economic activity, despite the persistence of incentive factors, such as income growth
Besides, the lower liquidity of the sovereign securities markets increases risk perception and demand monitoring
Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of 4 headline inflation in the future
In eleven out of the nineteen segments of the manufacturing industry, the Nuci presented positive performance month-on-month
They all agreed that there are signs consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run
November figures are expected to reveal a similar result with no significant pressures on production costs
On its turn, important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should contribute to consolidating the resumption of activity and hence, to reduce the residual idleness margin of productive factors
For September, the leading and coincident indicators available point to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, which will be favored by the several stimulus factors that influence economic activity, including the monetary easing already implemented
These shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of new information
On the other hand, the increase of geopolitical tensions in Syria and Egypt translated into upward pressure for the oil prices
In the Euro Area, where the resumption of activity continues contained, the most recent data evidenced that consumer spending has not shown significant recovery yet and economic activity in the region continues to be driven mainly by the external sector
A stronger deceleration in the United States economy tends to generate a more favorable trend for interest rates and petroleum prices
The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may impose risks to the inflationary trajectory is limited
The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committees assessment, are largely permanent developments
These risks become more intense as the depreciation starts to be perceived as permanent and the demand recovers
Since December, the foreign sector and, more precisely, the trade balance has performed well and one can expect strong improvement in export operations
The improved prospects for the domestic economy accentuated the demand for fixed rate securities
Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debt at historically high levels
The Copom asserts that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the Couto Berriel
The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, with smaller and gradually increasing weight, The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level
According to the baseline scenario, which uses the interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and the exchange rate evolving according to the purchasing power parity, the inflation projections are above the target for 2022 and around the target for As for the balance of risks, the Committee pondered that the risk of a deanchoring of longer-term expectations, derived from developments in the fiscal scenario, points to an upward bias for the projections of its baseline scenario
The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved
Other members drew attention to the disinflation in services prices already observed
On the one hand, manufacturing output fell
Data have also continued to indicate that employment has increased at a higher pace outside large metropolitan areas
Leading and coincident indicators anticipate a new increase in industrial output in February
Also, businesses have made an effort to regain profit margins in a scenario of falling aggregated demand
The labor market is starting to adjust, albeit gradually, to this environment, which shall exert additional pressure to the real wage bill, already affected by the impact from administered price adjustments
Economic activity continues to expand, but at a slower pace and more in line with supply conditions, so as not to result in significant inflationary pressures
Exports of sectors with higher capacity utilization level, such as metallurgy and paper and pulp, fell compared to June 2000, offset by increased exports of meat and soybeans
The Committee emphasized that the appropriate level of monetary tightening is also dependent on the prevailing fiscal framework
Basic interest rates fell in the United States and in Europe, and Argentina successfully completed a debt swap operation
The Copom evaluates that the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity - less intense than previously anticipated - is essentially due to limitations regarding the supply side
External Environment After the beginning of the war in Iraq, uncertainties on the external front subdued with indications that the war would be short and that there would be no significant damage to Iraqi oil fields
Notwithstanding, industrial surveys indicate reduction in employment in this sector
emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the The Copom reiterates its view that the continuity of evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian on inflation projections and expectations
The Copom evaluates that the loss of domestic demand dynamism should result in the reduction of inflationary pressures
These estimates naturally involve uncertainty and will continue to be reassessed by the Committee over time
Between June 7th and July 19th, one- three- six-month and one- and three-year rates increased by 0.62 p.p., 0.47 p.p., 0.21 p.p., 0.03 p.p
On January 31, the National Treasury held two NTN-C uniform price auctions
This movement was mainly caused by the uncertainty regarding both economic and political impacts, in the medium term, of the energy crisis and the election process next year
The Copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and GDP rates have converged; and that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this year, compared to However, according to the Committees view, the activity tends to go into recovery trend next year
Finally, the Committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvement of the business environment
The Committee unanimously decided to interrupt the easing cycle, highlighting that the uncertain global scenario and the domestic scenario, marked by resilient economic activity, an increase in its own inflation projections and deanchored expectations, require greater caution
Devaluation of the euro and sharp oil price increases are the factors that have created the greatest pressure on prices
However, a significant risk still prevails related, particularly, to the possibility of concession of high nominal wages increases, with negative impacts over inflation
In this context, even considering that, at the moment, the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate decision, the Committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different stance, by adjusting the monetary policy instruments, in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets path
No significant change occurred in the prospective scenario for the output gap, but a deeper debate took place about the effects of a possible greater-than- projected credit tightening on economic activity
The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, mainly price setters
The volatility that has marked the major asset markets of the industrial countries obviously generates repercussions that affect perceptions of country risk and, consequently, the exchange rate trajectory
The main factor driving the liquidity contraction in the period was the net revenues of the Government
The nations surplus position in trade operations with Mexico, the United Kingdom and Chile increased further, while the deficit in operations with Venezuela also grew, in this case as a consequence of higher outlays on crude oil
rise in the adjusted inflation target for 2003, according to the methodology described in the Open Letter of the Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil to the Ministry of Finance of January 21, However, the Copom considers it premature to modify the adjusted target at this time due to the high volatility of international oil prices, and believes it is preferable to wait for more information about the adjustments that could affect regulated prices
Therefore, the Committee concluded that the appropriate degree of monetary tightening is significantly more contractionary than that used in the baseline scenario
For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the 7 economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity
The Committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices, such as in food and possible adjustments of electric power tariffs and fuel prices, will be symmetric, that is to say, monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply shocks
The December IPCA reflected pressures on both market and regulated prices
It is through such second-round effects and enhance Copoms communications
The National Confederation of Industry CNI registered growth in industrial employment since October, while the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo has perceived this trend since September
The US economy recorded, in July, the first monthly advance in industrial production since October 2008, and production of the Euro Zone has been showing stability since last April
The BCB also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working days
In this context, after a period of aggressive monetary policy easing, in several countries, monetary policy continues a phase of stability, whereas those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis and recover more quickly and intensely tend to adopt more restrictive monetary policy stance
above the level registered in the same month of 2006, while the average installed capacity utilization rate in the year stood 1.8 p.p., 1.7 p.p
Core inflation remained at moderate levels in the US, Euro Area and Japan, considering the relatively moderate prospects for the activity level in these regions
The Committee also stresses that monetary policy should continue being contractionary for sufficient time at a level that consolidates both the disinflation process and the anchoring of expectations around the targets
The recovery of semi and non-durable goods production, albeit less intense, have increased in tandem with the gradual improvement of domestic demand
The 62.4 result, in a scale ranging from 0 to 100, reflected greater optimism of businessmen in relation to both current conditions and next six months expectations
The Committee understands that, for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle, the pace of easing depends on the stage of the cycle, without necessarily reflecting changes in the Committees baseline scenario or in the balance of risks
In seasonally adjusted terms, the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 p.p
The inflation rate increase in the short-term, caused by either seasonal factors or financial assets prices volatility, should not contaminate private expectations for longer periods
These conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and by inflation expectations anchored around the the structural interest rate of the economy, with the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy widespread benefits for society
At the external scenario, the possibility of Europes debt crisis deepening, the release of weaker economic indicators in Europe, US and China and the retreat of the North American treasuries rates have also contributed to the reduction of the future rates
Nonetheless, there is a significant risk factor in the external scenario
Between January 19 and March 9, one-, three-, and six-month rates decreased by 143 bps, 154 bps and 148 bps, respectively
The largest individual impact was of 0.07 percentage point from readjustments of electric energy tariffs
The Copom discussed the limitations on the use of this instrument in The Committee then assessed the appropriate emerging countries
Furthermore, the Copom emphasizes that the outlook for the upcoming semesters indicates moderation in the prices dynamics of some real and financial assets
After a brief contraction, domestic demand has recovered, largely thanks to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit resumption
The Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, the inflation rate stands around the target in In short, the Copom considers that, at the present moment, the risks for the inflation trajectory remain limited
The economic activity in Japan, on its turn, shows signs of consistent expansion, led by exports, especially to Asia
Industrial output continued on a growth trajectory in the first four months of the year, registering accumulated growth of 4.03 in the 12 month period ended in June
Regarding monetary policy, advanced economies have persisted with strongly accommodative stances
Despite the recent reduction, driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high
For the Committee, these effects, the programs of public services concession, the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of businessmens confidence create prospects for investment intensification
Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the aggregate supply and demand composition
Particularly, monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices, partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global scale, do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to worse expectations
For 2014, the inflation forecast is around the midpoint inflation target in both scenarios
Business and consumer expectations decreased in September
in the IE and 0.4 p.p
On April 17, the median expectations of inflation as measured by the IPCA and collected through the daily Banco Central survey were still above the inflation target for 2000 6.48, as compared to a target of 6
had been considered adequate to begin this adjustment, as to smooth the inflexion of the monetary stance and minimize its initial turbulence risks, the Committee evaluates that, at this moment, a 0.5 p.p
Nevertheless, developments have so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of possible changes in economic policy in some large economies, notably in the United States
The members of the Committee also discussed the extent of the exchange rate pass-through in the Brazilian economy
In February, based on seasonally adjusted data, formal employment expanded by 0.4, with creation of 119.4 thousand jobs in the two-month period
The performance of consumer prices in the month of February demonstrated that the seasonal pressures generated by in natura foodstuffs and education outlays evident in the previous month had been dissipated
In such environment, the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that short-term uncertainties contaminate longer time horizons
This premium is dynamic and tends to be relevant monetary policy horizon, which currently larger in Brazil, given the countrys relative fiscal includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, This fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective information on inflation would be considered fiscal path
IPCA core inflation continued to accelerate in November, according to the three criteria by excluding regulated prices and household food, by smoothed and by non-smoothed trimmed-means
These elements and quasi fiscal developments are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path
The members of the Copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to anchored inflation expectations and prospects of The members of the Committee also discussed the economic recovery
In this regard, the Committee believes that continued monitoring of these factors is necessary to assess whether the maintenance of interest rate rates for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure inflation convergence
At the São Paulo Consumer Protection Service SPC, the net default rate came to 7.2 in January, as compared to 8.5 in December
This increase was due to improved future expectations by consumers
Regarding inflation, as expected in the second stage of disinflation, the speed of disinflation is slowing down, requiring serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy
It should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors, as suggested in some industrial surveys, indicates that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions
In fact, the Icea remained above the IEC for the eighth consecutive month
By the way, despite the weakness of investment, which reflects, largely, the increased uncertainties and the slow recovery of confidence, domestic demand will continue to be driven by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, as well as by the moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate
The Committee will continue to reassess relative price shocks in an inflation targeting regime the estimates of this rate over time
The transportation group was the main responsible for deceleration of the index in June, with a contribution of 0.24 p.p., compared to -0.12 p.p
The Copom members debated on the level of economic slack
The BRL exchange rate has shown volatility in the period, reflecting the various changes in the domestic and international scenarios
The US consumer confidence increased in June to 101.9, after remaining nearly unchanged at 93.1 in the previous month
Regarding clothing, the recently seen pressures are expected to reverse due to early winter sales
Considering the hypothesis that important external variables continue under pressure for a longer period, the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime could judiciously absorb the primary shocks associated with this pressure
The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, an already anticipated trend, and which is in line with assessments present in previous Inflation Reports and Copom Minutes
Consequently, neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts yet, nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely materialized
The temporary halt in the transportation The Copoms inflation projections in the scenario sector in May, however, makes it more difficult to with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted assess the recent evolution of economic activity
The Committee recalled that the incorporation of scenarios and exogenous variables, such as fiscal dynamics or the external scenario, takes place through their impact on the prospective dynamics of inflation, with no mechanical relationship with the determination of the interest rate
On the other hand, in China, wholesale inflation increased in August
The Copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost, which, according to the Committees assessment, are largely permanent developments, have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate
In another dimension, as illustrated by actions that were implemented, the Committee 5 considers as opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit operations
Prospectively, the unpredictability associated with the pandemic evolution and the necessary adjustment in government spending from 2021 onwards increases the uncertainty about the maintenance of the economic activity recovery
The Copom believes that this deterioration should be contained and, therefore, the signs of persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand expansion and aggregate supply, which, ultimately, tend to increase the risk for inflation dynamics, must be reversed
Other members emphasized the volatile nature of these prices in an environment of pressured inventories
In this case, economic activity could benefit from the progressive recovery of real earnings, which depends on a price stability environment in the medium-term
The Copom notices that the available indicators regarding domestic absorption and GDP growth rates have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential
The overall average tenure on credit operations reached 94.8 months in November, representing a decrease of 0.8 months, month-on-month, and an increase of 8.1 months, year-over-year
This decline, however, was lower than suggested by the behavior of leading and coincident industrial indicators
Apparently, the perception of systemic risk resurfaced, fueled by the view that there would be interdependence between a possible fiscal consolidation in economies that are facing difficulties in this area and the balance sheets of financial institutions
The Copom projections for the 2004 IPCA fell, mainly due to the favorable September result
It can be emphasized that, according to this comparison basis, all segments decelerated, relative to July
The ample liquidity in the financial markets, the upgrade of the Greece sovereign bonds and the perception that, if necessary, the authorities will continue to act in a coordinated way to enlarge the monetary policies easing stances have supported the recovery of confidence, favoring the valuation of assets and the retreat of the sovereign risk in the most vulnerable economies in the Euro Zone
In the month, fixed rate loans fell in some segments, mirroring the reduction in the slope of the yield curve as a result of the improvement in the sovereign-risk premium and the expectations of falling inflation
The Committee notes that the domestic demand will continue to be driven by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, as well as the moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporates
Copom emphasizes that it will also continue to monitor inflationary dynamics in underlying inflation measures, which best reflect the current inflation trend as well as its prospects
Growth of 3.1 in February  in the seasonally adjusted series  resulted in expansion of 10.7 in the first two months of the year, in comparison to the same period of the preceding year
The highly positive fiscal result obtained during the course of the year confirmed the governments commitment to austerity and stands as a guaranty of compliance with the targets set down in the Economic Program
Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available information
Some members emphasized the recent dynamics, while others emphasized that the underlying fundamentals for the dynamics of services inflation do not allow yet to convincingly extrapolate the recent benign behavior
Over the last few quarters, economic activity data have surprised with higher growth rates in different components of demand
The growth resulted in the highest consumer confidence since the beginning of the survey, in Regarding fixed capital investment, indicators showed the continuity of the recovery in August
Regarding the global economy, leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging economies
However, the members of the Copom target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy
The Copom considers that this process shall be intensified and, therefore, the signs of the persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand and supply expansion shall be reverted, because they tend to increase the risk for the inflationary dynamics
The dollar fell against the currencies of Korea, Mexico and the UK, and appreciated against the currencies of Australia, Japan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, India and Turkey
On its turn, the recover, at the margin, in the pace of durable goods production expansion reflects, predominantly, the exemption tax measures and also some easing of credit conditions
Credit operations also sustained an upward trend
The BCB also carried out 17 repos in the period, fifteen of which were overnight borrowings, one with a two-working-day tenure and another with an overnight lending
Besides these domestic uncertainties, the external scenario remains troublesome
The difficulties of policy coordination and the lack of consistent rescue mechanisms for the Euro Zone countries favored the intensification of the movement of risk aversion in financial markets since the end of October, leading to increased cost of debt financing in the countries of the region
Taking into account this fact, together with the waning of pressures derived from administered price adjustments, a prospect for significant reduction in inflation rates is expected for the coming months
This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey retreated to around 3.0 percent for Expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 remain around 4.0 percent, 4.25 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively
Despite this, the off-season agricultural period could have a marginal impact on inflation in the final quarter of the year
Country specific indicators relative to July and August and entrepreneurs perception, translated into the fall in confidence indicators of the three major economies in the region Germany, Italy and France-, suggest the maintenance of this trend in the next quarter
The Committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international markets, as well as of some tension and volatility episodes in the currencies markets
Industrial production decreased in 16 of the 27 branches of activity
The turnover of term DI contracts was also reduced to 2 thousand contracts from 3.3 thousand, with no new transactions
The Committee also highlights evidences of price pressures in metal commodity markets, to some extent, offset by moderation in segments of agricultural and energy commodities
In the Euro Area, the most recent indicators of industrial production, consumption, economic sentiment and unemployment rate reinforce the prospects of continued contraction of economic activity in the region
On the other hand, the Committee notes that the fragile international scenario represents an important factor restraining aggregate demand
In light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial conditions, credit contribution for the support of domestic demand diminished, but signs of recovery continue to accumulate, in particular regarding loans to individuals
Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations
Regarding the domestic outlook, the effects of Selic rate adjustments have not been totally incorporated into price dynamics
Prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable, at a less intense rhythm than the observed at the start of the year, as evidenced by data on trade, inventories and industrial production, among others
As in previous meetings, the Copom also examined the projections produced according to the same methodology, and according to the same benchmark and market scenarios for the interest and exchange rates paths, taking into account the Top 5 short-term inflation expectations for March and hence, projecting inflation for the following months
Considering that there is a strong possibility that inflation deviates from the targets, monetary policy should act preemptively
The latest inflation readings were higher than expected, and the Committee raised its projection for the remaining months of This revision was due to continuing food and industrial price increases which, in turn, are a consequence of a persistent exchange rate depreciation, the oil price rise, and the income transfer programs
Focusing on the supply side, the Committee evaluates that, in the longer term, more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have emerged; the services sector, on its turn, tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent years
On the other hand, the remaining risks for the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of Brazilian assets prices, amidst a process of decreasing external sources of funding and mechanisms of price adjustments that contribute to prolong inflationary pressures observed last year
This increase in investment is essential for a sustainable growth path, with no imbalances between supply and demand
Second, the marginal deterioration of market inflation expectations for 2005, even after the adjustment in the monetary stance, is an alert of its possible downward rigidity
The maintenance of the zero interest rate monetary policy, associated to expansionist fiscal measures, are not producing positive results
The Committee discussed thoroughly the labor market and assessed that the current wage increases may be linked to some extent to pressures in the labor market
As a relevant horizon, which covers the calendar years consequence, the Committee members highlighted 2017 and 2018, indicate that there is room for a the need to monitor the resumption of this path
Notes revised by the Board
Amid an uncertain geopolitical context, with a strong labor market and tightened output gap in advanced economies, Copom believes that the prolonged monetary policy tightening strategy has been essential to control global inflation, facilitating inflation control in emerging markets
In this context, the assessment of purchase managers, expressed by the global PMI, fell for the second consecutive month, reaching 52.2 points in April, the lowest value of the last five months
The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over the households confidence and consumption
The average real earnings of persons employed have been recovering gradually without creating undue cost pressures
In this context, an towards target over the relevant horizon and the risks additional monetary stimulus would mitigate this risk
The result was creation of 590 thousand jobs in the first half of the year
They stressed that the persistence of uncertainties regarding fiscal Committee members then discussed the evolution, sustainability tends to be contractionary
The expectations of increases in the real interest caused the rise in the NTN-C coupons
The central banks in the Euro Area and Japan still keep on waiting the extension of the international financial turmoil to return to their gradual tightening monetary policies stance
This persistence is due to wage and price readjustments that have occurred since the beginning of the year and that have been based on the high inflation rate accumulated in the last twelve months, rather than assessments of future inflation
By the way, in order to fight these and other inflationary pressures, in the last twelve months, the monetary conditions were tightened, but the Committee evaluates that the effects of the Selic rates hikes on inflation are, in part, yet to materialize
More importantly, the Committee unanimously believes that the reanchoring of inflation expectations should be pursued, regardless of the sources of the currently observed deanchoring
Growth was particularly strong under sales involving goods with high unit value as a result of a more ample supply of credit
Copom also evaluated that there is no evidence of an ongoing monetary tightening beyond that necessary for the inflation convergence to the target, and the scenario still calls for caution, reinforcing the view of serenity and moderation that Copom has expressed
Manufacturing industry was the sector that recorded the higher number of dismissals, 273.2 thousand, followed by agriculture and services, which eliminated 134.5 and 117.1 thousand jobs, respectively
Nevertheless, the deterioration of agents expectations indicates the possibility of greater pressure for passthrough in the future
In the case of the Euro Zone, the outlook was bright, particularly with regard to the expected performance of the German and French economies
The average index for the quarter stood at 114.7 points, the lowest for the historical series started in March The Copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit expansion
These estimates naturally and subsequent years
They analyzed the inflation trajectory during this and the following years
The Committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international markets, as well as greater volatility and dollar appreciation trend in the US
The Greek long-term debt was downgraded by a rating agency, and the Greek government formalized, with the countries that comprise the Euro Area and the IMF, the request for activation of the loan scheme
The yield curve shifted downwards and became further inverted, particularly at the short end
Only the segments of semi and non-durable consumer goods have not showed significant growth rates, as they depend more strongly on real earnings
Without the seasonal adjustment, the Nuci in December stood 1.5 p.p
With the sole exception of construction industry inputs, investment indicators for February showed positive growth
In particular, they highlighted the possible implications of the current scenario for the sensitivity of services inflation to the economic activity
In this context, the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation increased, although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial markets
Accordingly, the majority of the Committee members argued, in particular, that the remaining uncertainties about the pace of economic recovery, largely due to the prospects that the period of weakness in the global economy will be more prolonged than anticipated, will have disinflationary impact on the domestic economy
The Central Bank intervened in the open market on a weekly basis with 2-week repo operations, and conducted daily liquidity management operations with maturities of 2 working days
On its turn, exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the real
The Copom understands that the reference to partial normalization, as well as the disclosure of the implicit neutral rate and the output gap in the models used by the Committee, increases the transparency of the Central Banks reaction function and, consequently, improves monetary policy efficiency
The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risk to domestic inflation trajectory continues to diminish
In short, evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing in the last months, showing important reduction in the idle margin of the industry, followed by the recovery of investments
Amongst the imports of capital goods, it bears emphasizing the acquisition of industrial machines, machines and equipments for office and scientific service, and parts and pieces for capital goods
The scenario of solid expansion of capital goods production observed since 2007, mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic growth, underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability consolidation, seems to persist in this year
In short, domestic demand, boosted by moderate expansion of credit, as well as by employment and income growth, has been the main factor sustaining activity
In this scenario, the that the Brazilian economy requires, notably those of fiscal conditioning factors have opposite effects on inflation for nature
However, the balance of risks for the US economy remains downwards, influenced, among others, by the end of fiscal stimuli this year, with only partial expectation of renewal, by the weak housing market, the slow recovery of the labor market; and by the fact that an important part of the recent increase in consumption is due to the reduction in savings
Import growth in February and in the first two months of 2005 was disseminated
The prevailing view, however, was that monetary policy tightening paths with 1.50 p.p
However, the members highlighted that upside risks to inflation remain significant, and with larger weight on their balance of risks
The sovereign risk premium reached a level as high as 1,800 basis-points in the weeks before the elections of October 14th
In general, the recent evolution of these indices indicates the reduction of the pressures stemming from wholesale prices over consumer prices
The manufacturing industry showed positive balance of 131.9 thousand jobs in the same period, which, together with the services and civil construction, also represented the highest balance registered for the series for this period
On the one hand, central banks policy, and high level of slack in the economy prescribe of several economies some major economies included stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below have provided additional monetary stimuli, which the structural level
On the other hand, important monetary and fiscal stimuli were introduced in the economy over the last few months, and should contribute to the recovery of the economy, and consequently, to the reduction of the idleness margin of production factors
Major economies have emphasized the principle of separation of objectives and instruments in the conduct of monetary and macroprudential policies
The Committee members also measures of exchange-rate pass-through to both mentioned the growing risks to the continued inflation and underlying inflation
It bears highlighting that the production grew in 16 out of the 27 surveyed activities, according to the same comparison basis
A few recent indicators have been interpreted as evidence that a more pronounced deceleration is progressing in a spontaneous fashion, despite the fact that it is difficult to identify turning points in volatile series, such as the ones regarding the level of economic activity
The index relative to the services sector reached 50.2 in September, which was still regarded as insufficient to indicate a consistent reversal of trend
Compared to July 2011, the rate also increased 0.2 p.p
However, it is not a trivial task to adequately quantify these effects and their repercussions
Several leading and coincident indicators confirm the Copoms evaluation regarding the positive activity trend
Parallel to this, exercises were also presented involving the modeling of alternatives for the formation of inflation expectations and for exchange rate evolution
As a result, the trade deficit dropped from US 760 million to US 180 million
Although the accommodation observed in the last two quarters has been more intense than the expected at the start of the year, as evidenced, among others, by data on inventories and industrial production, the prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable
Business sentiment in the US, Japan and Europe continued to improve
All members agreed that the balance to future sustainability
The sectors that demonstrated notable growth were oil refining and alcohol production, chemical products, machines and electrical materials and metallurgy
Moreover, it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities prices, whose more consistent evidence appeared in the last weeks, could contribute to avoid that inflationary pressures intensify even more
The Copom also understands that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will demand that the economy and financial system behavior under a different interest rate level should be closely monitored
Still in the subject, Copom reaffirmed that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate, and that, as usual, it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment into the domestic inflationary dynamics
The balance of credit operations based on nonearmarked resources increased in April, mostly as a result of a cutback in compulsory reserves on demand deposits
Nonetheless, IPCA inflation accelerated in December even excluding household food prices
In specific cases, changes in the growth pattern are anticipated, a development that tends to be permanent
Notwithstanding these short-term developments, recent indicators have shown that the main economies are facing difficulties in consolidating their fundamentals, mainly with worsened fiscal accounts and less room to maneuver monetary policy
It is important to highlight that the resources will be provided from each respective countrys budget and there isnt forecast of creation of any single fund
However, they deemed appropriate to warn that this view is more susceptible to changes in the evolution of the scenario and associated risks than in previous meetings
The Committee again assessed that these recurring surprises point to high dynamism in the labor market, which has shown to be tight
In case of inconsistency, the Portuguese version prevails
Finally, the Committee debated the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle in an uncertain global outlook
In Europe, the milder winter has also reduced the likelihood of extreme scenarios in energy supply
More recent price indicators confirm the downward trend in consumer inflation in February
Another point of view was raised in the sense that uncertainties as to the two decisions cited above required a more moderate interest rate cutback that could be further deepened with the adoption of a downward bias and utilization of that bias should the two events produce positive results
Even taking for granted that this acceleration is really temporary, the increase in inflation projections is enough to suggest caution in monetary management
The weekly Fiesp survey in the month of February confirmed this trend, registering creation of 2,230 new job positions in São Paulo
In addition, it bears emphasizing the elevation of the twelve-month trailing average tenure of real estate financing and vehicles acquisition operations, which reached 1909 days and 577 days, up from 1445 days and 524 days, respectively
Data from the Ministry of Labor still indicated growth of the formal employment in October, as observed since the beginning of the year
Copom emphasized that the extension of the cycle over time will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks
This assessment is supported by signs of a more moderate expansion of credit supply, especially for individuals; by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, but with some accommodation at the margin; and by the recent trajectory of inventories in some industrial sectors
Regarding this group, it bears emphasizing the acquisitions of primary food products, mineral, chemical and pharmaceutics products, and transportation equipment accessories
However, in general, consumer confidence remained weak due to the labor market conditions in the respective countries
The prospects have continued indicating activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in others, although, in general, the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario prevails
Apparently the adoption of a broad set of measures to restore financial stability in Europe was not sufficient to calm market participants
The magnitude and the pace of the pass-through of wholesale industrial price increases to consumer prices have been unsurprised
These distortions are manifested, for example, in the shortening of the planning horizons of households, companies and governments, as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen confidence
Regarding data at the margin, on the one hand, there were new upward surprises in activity
The sustained dynamism of the domestic activity is also worth mentioning, furthermore thanks to the continuity of investments, the increases of agricultural income and the recovery in consumption, contributing to a gradual recovery in the growth trend
However, it bears highlighting that, no matter the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, international oil prices at historically high levels affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as by the deterioration they may cause on economic agents inflation expectations
The trend of reduction in the idle capacity is the result of economic activity expansion, not totally offset by the maturity of investment projects
In Argentina, the congress approved the zero deficit program and the government still tries to preserve the credibility in its capacity to recover economy growth
More recent indicators for the Japanese economy point to improvement in the economic environment
In the Euro Zone, the economic activity is at its longest period of contraction
On its turn, the external sector contribution to a favorable inflationary scenario, in light of the strong rhythm of domestic demand expansion, of global inflationary pressures, as well as depreciation in the prices of Brazilian assets, have become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over the productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate
Progress in the financial markets structure, the FX and inflationary risk premium reduction, among other factors, seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral rate
For the Committee, however, the progress made in the fight against inflation - like benign signals stemming from the medium and long-term expectations indicators has not yet been sufficient
The three categories basic, semimanufactured and manufactured registered record exports
There is no factor that is by itself determinant for monetary policy decisions
However, the discussion brought elements that would allow to see a mitigation of the anticipated activity slowdown in the coming months, due to the increase in household income, as a result of the rise in the minimum wage, social benefits, and the more resilient labor market
The overall average tenure on credit operations reached 90 months in April, representing an increase of 4 months, month-on-month, and 15.9 months, year-over-year
The Committee noted with particular concern the deterioration in longer-term inflation expectations
Recent data on consumption recorded negative rates for Japan and also for the Euro Area
Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections
They also encompass the expected change in relative prices of goods and services due to the downward shift in supply, that tends to raise the indices
During the coming months, credit growth and payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity
Committee members judge that these shocks agreed that the balance of risks is symmetric
The relief in the markets favored the valuation of the euro and the currencies of emerging countries against the dollar, while the US and German ten-year securities yields increased relative to the record lows of May
They considered that despite the intensity of the second wave of the pandemic, the latest available data have surprised positively
The average level of exchange for October and November was adjusted in light of the recent depreciation of the real
According to this mains scenario, domestic economic activity moderates and commodities prices in international markets and the exchange rate show some stability, among other effects
Domestic demand has continued to expand strongly and supports the economic activity dynamics, including sectors less exposed to external competition, when the effects of stimuli factors, such as income growth, are still acting over the Brazilian economy
However, industrial production, which rose in three of the last four months through January; the trade flow, which in January reported the first year-over-year growth in eight months; and the February Manufacturing PMI, increasing for the second consecutive month, suggest improvement in economic conditions
This short-term trajectory reflects, whether the degree of monetary stimulus is adequate
In this respect, the Copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, discriminating between one-off and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the circumstances
With regard to the labor market, figures for the first half of the year indicate that the process of employment and productivity growth begun toward the end of 1999 has moved steadily forward
The marginal increase in inflation expectations for the year is, however, related mainly to the higher than expected adjustment of some regulated prices, as was the case for urban bus fares, and to the less favorable international environment
In the event that the risk profile deteriorates so that it implies changes to the inflation prospective scenario considered this time by the Committee, the monetary policy strategy will promptly be adapted to the circumstances
Considering the monthly series without seasonal adjustment, in June the Nuci was 3.4 p.p
This indication reflects the stage of the tightening cycle as its cumulative effects will manifest themselves over the relevant horizon
Under these circumstances, the pace of activity depends significantly upon the evolution of real earnings, the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the increments of governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming months
Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years, when inflation targets were systematically met
There are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in Europe and parts of Asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices, which could be reversing
However, expansion in production capacity and productivity gains achieved in recent years have created considerable additional leeway for continued growth under this heading
In the central economies, therefore, the prospects for adoption of monetary tightening policies seem limited
Jan. 31 - Feb. 1 mitigate any inflationary effects of the fiscal policy
In addition, a severe financial crisis in the U.S. and, at a lower extension, in Europe, is added up to this difficult macroeconomic scenario
The major factors of uncertainty analyzed during recent meetings underwent considerable change
Retail sales performance reflects the continuity of payroll growth and better credit conditions, together with the impacts of social programs and the recovery of the agricultural sector
Nevertheless, the Copom members pointed out the risk for the Brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign global outlook in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy
The housing market continues to signal recovery, with housing prices, sales of existing homes and confidence in construction companies at high levels
As the G3 economies show high idleness for the production factors, a process exacerbated by fiscal concerns, central banks maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance
In fact, recent data about the absorption of capital goods still dont allow the conclusion of inflexion in the investment expansion trend
At the same time, in the alternative scenario which considers no additional increase in domestic fuel prices, the target for 2001 would be met with considerable ease
The tenure related to individuals and corporate segments increased four and twenty-one days, respectively, reaching 620 and 432 days, in the order
Copom concluded by assessing that the inflation outlook has become more challenging, with the increase of medium-term inflation projections, even conditioned on a higher interest rate
In short, the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite some signs of moderation at the margin
If the quarterly moving average is taken, the result in November was the sixth increase in a row
In this sense, the minority of the Copom members argued that the activity recovery tends to be supported by monetary, fiscal and credit impulses already introduced in the economy
The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation
According to the baseline scenario, which uses the interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey, inflation projections are slightly below the target for The Committee pondered that short-term fiscal risks remain high, implying an upward bias in these projections
The twelve-month inflation projection for the first quarter of 2024, in the scenario using the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus survey, remains consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon
The Committee members reaffirmed the understanding that, with anchored inflation expectations, with inflation forecasts a little below target for 2018 and with the high level of economic slack, the Copoms baseline scenario prescribes continuation of the monetary easing cycle
Based on newly available information, already identified shocks and their impacts on the economy were subjected to review
The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy
Hence, the contribution of market prices to inflation increased in Additionally, of the 1.70 p.p
Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continued quite robust until the third quarter, and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration trend, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance in line with assessments present in previous Copom Minutes
For 2012, the projections increased in both the benchmark and the market scenarios, and stand above the midpoint of the target in both scenarios
However, between Copoms meetings, relevant questionings arose regarding the future of the current fiscal framework, resulting in higher risk premia
Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite robust, and is at least partially the cause of the short-term inflationary pressures, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance
Regarding the supply side, the Committee evaluates that, in the longer term, more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have emerged; the services sector, on its turn, tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent years
The BCB also carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, on 30 occasions, as a borrower
However, it bears emphasizing that the prospects for foreign funding of Brazilian economy remain favorable
The international liquidity contraction has been contributing to a deleverage process by asset managers, which in turn has been pressuring down the prices of financial assets
One can notice an impact in recent data regarding both the composition of new household credit operations and the moderate increase in the delinquency rate, partly related to the behavior of the real disposable income, which suggests some reduction
Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to the projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking prices dynamics and the balance of risks associated to their projections
The main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in Regarding the prices of other commodities, it is noteworthy the increase in the agricultural international prices
For the Committee, however, the outlook that has been taking shape is that consumption would tend to keep growing, but at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent years, and investments would gain momentum
The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation
This prerogative is used when the level of uncertainty recommends adoption of a more flexible stance on the part of the monetary authority
Consumer expectations remained stable in the U.S. and Europe and presented slight improvement in Japan
Regarding inflation expectations, the Committee notes with concern the recent movement at longer horizons
However, the result of 126.7, in a scale ranging from 0 to 200, reflects an overall positive sentiment, mainly regarding future consumption intentions
Copom will continue to pay attention to the dynamics of income stemming from several surveys to better evaluate the degree of slack in the labor market and its potential impacts on the services inflation
The Copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the Brazilian economy, which determined retreat in interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate
In this debate, a divergence was observed in the Committee concerning the degree of signaling regarding the next steps
The Committee emphasizes that this prescription requires an environment with anchored expectations
Regarding the external component of the aggregate demand, the main scenario anticipates a more benign trajectory than that registered in recent years
The Committee debated the recent labor market data
There was a unanimous conclusion on the need for an even more cautious monetary policy and a diligent monitoring of the unfolding scenario
The Fecomercio-SP survey pointed to a recovery of consumer confidence in May, after three consecutive monthly falls
On the one hand, there are the episodes involving the banking sector and the consequent need to provide liquidity
The effects of these stimuli, however, counter the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, and a possible deepening of the fiscal crisis that several European countries face
The Copom reiterates that the removal of the forward guidance does not mechanically imply interest rates increases, since, at this moment, uncertainties regarding the evolution of growth still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus
The Committee considers that the external environment remains especially complex
Nevertheless, the Copom pondered once more the risk to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation The economy continues to operate with a high level trajectory
Inflation expectations remain unanchored and are a cause for concern
The provision of new funding for these two programs and for the Loan Support Program, scheduled for the next 15 months, exceeds 50 trillion
All members agreed that June inflation reflected significant upward pressure from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price changes
In October, there were no monetary authoritys interventions in the domestic spot market
The Brazilian economy, more specifically, does not seem to have been significantly affected by the recent turmoil, and should sustain its growth trajectory, essentially driven by domestic demand
The intensity of the pass-through will depend on price-makers future inflation expectations
The main drivers were gasoline, meat, urban bus fares, clothing, chicken, housemaid services, fuel-alcohol, and water and sewage prices, responsible for 0.61 p.p
The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment
Under such circumstances, a relevant risk is posed by the possibility of concession of nominal wages increase incompatible with productivity growth
The Copom highlights that, in moments such as the current one, the monetary policy should remain especially vigilant, in order to minimize risks that high inflation rates, such as the ones observed in the last twelve months, persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy
The average tenure of personal credit operations totaled 434 days, an 87-day extension relative to July 2006, as a consequence of the increasing share of payroll-deducted contracts
Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed the With regard to underlying inflation, in recent view that the current ex-ante real interest rates provide months its various measures have risen from levels stimulus to the economy
The most likely scenario is a continuous recovery in consumption as a consequence of improved consumer sentiment, higher real payrolls and lower consumer default rates
The Copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion
Weaker industrial activity levels are expected to reduce imports
Since the beginning of the monetary policy adjustment process, inflation expectations and forecasts have improved, although the current headline and core inflation are still incompatible with the medium-term targets
It bears emphasizing the acceleration of industrial prices, which began in the second half of 2007 and seems to have intensified lately
Eastern Asian economies, which tend to present high dependence on both American and Japanese demand, are searching for measures to countervail external sector retraction, with China and South Korea featuring as the most successful
The Committee also considered that fiscal risks generate an upward bias in these projections, potentially justifying an increase in policy rates earlier than that assumed in its baseline scenario
Industrial output in the month of February registered annual growth of 4.1 and made use of 81.4 of installed production capacity
The Copom understands that Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in the interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate
Food prices are also expected to continue affecting inflation, especially meat and dairy products, due to the beginning of the inter-harvest period
The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and GDP growth rates have continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential
Important emerging economies 4 experience a transition period, and therefore, of moderation in the activity pace, despite the resilience of the domestic demand
The Committee assessed that this signaling is due to prudential restrictions regarding reductions of the Selic rate and, therefore, should be kept in communication
The moderation in the pace of growth was noticeable in all components of domestic demand, and resulted, in part, from the policy actions implemented since the end of 2010, intensified by the deterioration of the global economic scenario since the third quarter of last year
In the last meetings of their monetary policy committees, central banks in the US, Japan and England maintained their basic interest rates
Still regarding the foreign sector, among the uncertainties that were mitigated, the ones related to the foreign funding of Argentina may be included
Regarding the monetary policy, in general, accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging economies
The Copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to show robustness, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion
In the United Kingdom, inflation is slightly above the official inflation target
In Recife and Belo Horizonte, figures were stable
As the recovery advances, consumption growth should give way to resumption in investment
It is important to also highlight that, for the Committee, the mentioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter 5 periods
In this robust balance of payments, low inflation environment, anchored expectations and prospect of economic recovery
In the external scenario, the expectation of reduction of the monetary stimuli by the Fed resulted in valuation of the US dollar against the main emerging currencies and in increase of the rates related to the US Treasury securities
Up to April, the trade balance presented significant growth of exports by increased shipments of beef and soy in grain and soy bran, due to plant health measures in European countries
First, the stage of the adjustment cycle is characterized by an already effectively tightening monetary policy, which is evidenced when looking at the difference in expectations for the paths of interest rate and inflation over the relevant monetary policy horizon
The Copom members reiterated the importance of reaffirming the conduct of monetary policy with exclusive focus on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, the balance of risks, and economic activity
The National Treasury also carried out for the first time a public offering of NTN-F, a fixed rate 4year security with a 6-month coupon
Considering credit operations by economic activity, loans to industries, other services and commerce increased above the overall average in August
Amongst regulated prices, the impact of the readjustment of electricity tariffs in Rio de Janeiro should stand out
These considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened uncertainty
In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects and surrounded by significant uncertainties
GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2007 recorded deceleration in the Euro Area and growth in Japan, although recent indicators signaled economic cooling in the latter
in each segment, offset by the negative contributions of -0.08 p.p
Inflation projections for July and August All members agreed that the appropriate level of corroborate the view that these effects should be stimulus depends on economic conditions in temporary
There is the risk that additional depreciation may cause a passthrough to prices and an increase in the projected inflation for this year and the next
The Committee members expressed the understanding that economic conditions, with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures running at low levels, inflation forecasts slightly below target for 2018, and high level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level
Copom determined that measures should be implemented so that price formation in the exchange market ceases to present the characteristics of a speculative bubble
Europe is showing signs of a significant economic The Copom stresses that the continuation of reforms slowdown and uncertainty drivers can contribute to even and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is slower global growth
Following three consecutive months of decline, the Consumer Confidence Index ICC, released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo FCESP, came TO 99.5 in June, compared to 94.4 in May, with growth of 3.6 over June 1999
At the end of June, the output levels of durable goods, capital and semi and nondurable goods were still well below the most recent peak in this series
Under this methodology, the readjustments of some items, which are concentrated in a few short periods of the year, are smoothed to avoid their exclusion from the core
However, the monetary authority restates that a more active policy stance will be adopted if the projected inflation deviates from the targets, due to an eventual deterioration of the factors that were responsible for the recent increase in inflation projections for 2004 and Even with a deteriorated inflationary environment, and the respective change in the required monetary policy stance, there are no reasons to review economic growth expectations
On the other hand, the and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy
The average level of utilization of installed production capacity in the manufacturing sector moved to 82 in January, practically the same level as in January 1995
In fact, the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade surplus
The delinquency rate on non-earmarked bank credits increased 0.6 p.p
below the observed in the same period of last year
The result was negative in the 4 use categories and in 20 out of the 26 surveyed activities, according to the same comparison basis
It shall be stressed the continuity of increased shipment of exported chicken meat, beef and pork meat, raw tobacco and corn, the latter not exported in 2000 due to problems in the harvest
Of the factors that have caused the greatest concern on the international scenario, petroleum is the most troublesome
It is not intended to bind Banco Central do Brasil in its monetary or foreign_ and an improvement in the countrys external financing, supported by the monetary and exchange policy adjustments, contributed to the appreciation of the Real as well as to the reduction of Brazils risk
Considering the long history of the Brazilian economy operating with the reference interest rate at a very high level, the unprecedented low interest rates may compromise the performance of some markets and economic sectors, with potential impact on financial intermediation
In short, the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous Copom meetings minutes that the contractionist effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism and, consequently, over the context on which the monetary policy operates, could become persistent, but would not be permanent
The domestic interest rates receded due to the announced accord with the International Monetary Fund in December, reflecting, in addition, the drop of interest rates in the United States
Following presentation of the central scenario, simulations were performed using economic models based on alternative scenarios
In light of the above, considering the balance of risks to inflation, the recovery in domestic activity and the complexity involved in the international environment, the Committee believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most appropriate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the target, even in a non-linear way
However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which has been more intense and may be longer than the anticipated, the activity expansion pace tends to intensify, as companies and households confidence strengthen
Transportation material and pharmaceutical products are the only two industries that remain below the respective historical average
It is worth observing that, in spite of the unfavorable outcome in that month, twelve out of the 21 surveyed industrial sectors increased their production
The labor market reflects this context and suggests the companies adjustments
Committee members discussed recent inflation The Copom stresses that the continuation of projections and the levels of various measures of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian underlying inflation
In these economies, where inflation does not constitute relevant risk in the short- and medium-term, monetary authorities have kept interest rates unchanged
For the Committee, despite recently released data have been less positive than anticipated, the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have remained
The Copom judges that, since the adoption of the forward guidance, inflation expectations reverted their declining trend relative to the target for the relevant horizon
On the other hand, the measures at comfortable levels, scenarios with 2020 inflation Copom judges that the risks associated with a slowing global projected below or slightly below target, and high level of economy remain and that economic policy and geopolitical slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary policy, uncertainties notably trade disputes and geopolitical i.e., interest rates below the structural interest rate level
High rates of unemployment for a long period, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, the limited scope for countercyclical policy actions and the political uncertainty are translated into projections of low growth for mature economies
All members of the Committee emphasized again that the approval and implementation of reforms, notably those of a fiscal nature, and of adjustments in the Brazilian economy, including those related to credit policy and of quasi-fiscal nature, are fundamental to the sustainability of disinflation, to the full operation of monetary policy and to the reduction of its structural interest rate, with widespread benefits for society
For this, they evaluated that the expected scenario has not materialized due to the additional deanchoring of expectations, increased inflation projections, the more adverse external scenario, and greater-than-expected economic activity dynamics
Copom understands, however, that monetary policy is adequate to meet the inflation target for the next year
The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity
As a result of the global recession outlook, energy and commodities prices have remained low, which resulted in significant reductions in inflation rates
Core inflation is also declining
The average tenure on reference credit operations increased thirteen days in October, reaching 522 days
The deceleration of market prices inflation was disseminated in both food and non-food prices
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates, increased in July, reaching 370 days, down from 378 days in December
A credible fiscal policy, based on predictable rules and transparency in its accounts, together with the pursuit of fiscal strategies that signal and reinforce the commitment to the fiscal framework in the coming years are important elements for anchoring inflation expectations and reducing the risk premia of financial assets, consequently impacting monetary policy
The reduction of idle capacity, in relation to the margins usually observed, occurs in several sectors despite the significant increase of investment
As already mentioned before, it is not possible to establish accurately the impacts of the 10 p.p
The component relative to current conditions fell by 0.3 point compared to the previous month, while that relative to expectations increased by 0.1 point
Moreover, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy remain
By its turn, the depreciation of the exchange rate has an impact on both, the production cost of goods, which use imported inputs, and also on the demand for tradable goods
This requires that monthly inflation is brought back to levels consistent with the desired path in the months right after the shock
In the financial markets, despite the environment of high uncertainty, there was reduction in risk aversion in the period
In the first four months of the year, growth in consumption and investment indicators was driven by expanded exports, improved expectations on the part of economic agents, an increased credit supply and declining banking system interest rates
The widening of spread of Argentine securities has affected other emerging market papers, as perceived by international investors
In this context, the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature economies, whereas in emerging economies, which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation trend, in addition to the facts already mentioned, the reaction seems to be more heterogeneous, but expansionist bias also prevails
The members of the should not be interpreted as a change in the conduct Copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their of monetary policy
The Copom restates that a stronger contribution of monetary policy to the recovery of less credit sensitive sectors in industry and retail should stem from its indirect impact, through higher employment and real earnings, both initially concentrated in the more sensitive sectors and gradually spreading over the whole economy
The The Copoms inflation projections in the scenario members concluded that the process of economic with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted recovery came to a halt in the past quarters
Among the factors underpinning this movement, it bears highlighting, on the domestic scenario, the disclosure of more pressured price indices and the market expectation for the start of the Selic target increase cycle
These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and the development of the Brazilian economy
They also observed that the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of the low level of current inflation may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory
Additionally, 2,168.9 thousand jobs were created in the last twelve months through June, of which 549.5 thousand in the manufacturing industry
Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have persisted with strongly accommodative stances
Foreign sales of semimanufactured products increased by 11.9 while exports of basic goods grew by 3.5
For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of inflation, but it will also be affected by the evolution in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer confidence
Financial system credit indicators still do not clearly suggest cooling in activity level
More recently, some developed countries postponed the easing cycle while others opted for a cautious start to the monetary easing process
This behavior in the mineral extraction sector was a consequence of the normalization of activities in Brazils oil and gas fields, after prescheduled maintenance interruptions in the last two months of Regarding the evolution of the manufacturing sector, the January result confirms the signs of a slowdown in industrial activity, with the exception of the sectors closely linked to external trade
The analysis of the items incorporated into the calculation of the core inflation in July points out to a pressure on prices, distributed among various categories of products
In this context, monetary policies stances have become highly expansionist and focused on non-traditional instruments in the mature economies, while the expansionist stance in the emerging economies has been more moderate
The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, further deanchoring of inflation expectations, and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy
On a sector-by-sector basis, the utilization level in the intermediate goods industry moved to 87, with particularly strong performances under pulp, paper and cardboard 92.6, metallurgy 89.1 and textiles 88.5
In the first nine months of the year, employment reached 2,086.6 thousand new jobs
The overall average tenure on credit operations reached 98 months in August, representing increases of 4.1 months, month-on-month, and 14.6 months, year-over-year
Frosts in the month of July are expected to generate adverse impacts on the output of such winter crops as wheat and the intermediate corn harvest
In the case of this trend persisting, the prospects for inflation may show additional decline, since the risk of the passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation accumulated this year to next years inflation also declines
The Committee noticed that the median of growth forecasts in the Focus survey is appreciably more optimistic than those of its baseline scenario and pondered whether the difficulties related to seasonal adjustments due to the pandemic shock would explain this divergence
Even considering that, at the moment, the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate decision, the Committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different monetary policy stance, in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets path
Evidences under this respect can be observed, among other factors, through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six years, at the same time that real interest rates have reduced
This interest rate involves a high level of uncertainty, and applies to the favorable food supply shock
The tenure related to corporate segments increased four days, while the one related to individuals increased five days, reaching 402 days and 595 days, respectively
The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation
However, the assessment was that this stabilization occurred at levels lower that those observed at the beginning of the year, which implies higher risk premia
The average tenure of corporate credit operations reached 299 days, while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled 467 days
At the present time, inflation expectations IPCA for 2000 have moved below the mark of 6.5, though they are still above the target
Second, inflation measured by the Industrial IPA remained high and accelerated, influenced by an increase in some commodities prices, by a higher demand for inputs and by the relative price realignment, favoring the sectors that benefited from stronger demand
Out of the twenty surveyed segments, fifteen decreased, as well as in three out of four use categories
Such distortions are not completely eliminated by usual seasonally adjusted methods
Due to the deterioration in the global macroeconomic scenario, the central banks of major economies have opted for the adoption of new quantitative easing measures
On the other hand, the Committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures
To a great extent, this was due to expanded sales of items of greater unit value with the added stimulus of an increasingly greater flow of credit
The number of working days in March 2003 was lower than normal due to the Carnival holidays
This implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest rates
Data on sales with checks and credit purchases, released by the ACSP, confirmed the downward trend of the retail market in March and in the first quarter of this year
Second, it is conditional that the financial system is resilient to the credit risk on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, arising from the current pandemic
These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of 2008 and later
Regarding the domestic economic activity, Copom firstly debated the release of GDP for 2023Q4, especially emphasizing the growth composition of demand components
The services sector, on its turn, tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent years
The monthly result reflected acceleration in market and regulated prices
Here, particular mention should be made of 0.61 expansion under manufacturing
In the main countries of the Euro area, business expectations remain unfavorable, with emphasis on the 12 percentage points reduction in the Italian indicator, between August and September
However, it should be noted that price indices have not revealed any significant sources of consistent pressures
During the coming months, credit growth, despite more moderate due to an increase in funding costs, and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity
Moreover, Copom stressed that it will continue incorporating labor market data into the analysis with no mechanical or definitive view about any impacts or relationships whatsoever
in the intermediate goods and of 0.6 p.p
On the other hand, in economies where inflation rates are above their respective targets, the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more limited
In Europe and in the major Asian countries, economic activity continues to record robust expansions, despite the increase in the risk of deceleration, caused by the uncertainties regarding the US domestic macroeconomic scenario, the impact of difficulties of real state market over financial institutions and credit conditions in these regions
The increase in the projected inflation for the next year results exclusively from the path of exchange rate and energy and oil products prices
In any case, most monetary authorities signal a prolonged period of high interest rates is necessary to fight inflationary pressures, which calls for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging countries
It is not intended to bind Banco Central do Brasil in its monetary or foreign_ trend expected to continue in In relation to the civil construction industry, the gap between the growth of production of equipment used by the sector and its modest performance in the last few years indicates favorable conditions for a future recovery
The European economy continues to stagnate
This ability to respond to different for prospective inflation and the associated balance of circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation environment with anchored expectations, which is to the targets over the relevant horizon for the conduct fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low of monetary policy, which includes inflation persists, even in face of adverse shocks
The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser extent, The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level
In short, the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous Copom meetings minutes, that the contraction effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism and, consequently, over the context on which the monetary policy operates, could become persistent, but would not be permanent
However, the industrial activity continues to be influenced by the international crisis, due to its effects both over exports and credit conditions, and over business and households expectations
Regarding the foreign outlook, recent signals of cooling in the global economic activity were key drivers in the decline of long term rates
It is worth mentioning the importance of ensuring a primary results trajectory that enables stabilization and further reduction of public debt to GDP ratio, which is a crucial measure to reinforce the positive perception regarding the economic environment, to improve the confidence of agents and to contribute to the anchoring of inflation expectations
Between November 17 and December 15, the 1-month and 6-month interest rates increased by 0.35 p.p
In the industrial countries, as a response to the incidents of September 11th in the United States, a slowdown in the consumption is observed, notwithstanding the drastic cut in interest rates made by the major central banks
In the metallic commodities market, the retreats in prices continue to be explained by the uncertainties regarding the Chinese demand and by the US dollar valuation, more recently deepened by the prospect of decreasing the monetary stimuli in the US
Together gasoline and alcohol-based fuel contributed 0.20 p.p
Labor market has continued to record ambiguous indicators, combining positive aspects with signs of loss of vigor
It is worth noting that the scenarios considered, consistent with the convergence of inflation to its targets, assumed a higher interest rate path than that used in the reference scenario
Wage adjustments have been favored by economic growth and low and stable inflation, which allow full and immediate compensation of past inflation, together with real wages increases sustained by productivity gains
It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects
The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial crisis, by the not yet very favorable prospects for global economy and, mainly, by recent macroprudential actions
In China and in Korea, domestic demand sustains economic growth, compensating the retraction in external demand
From another point-of-view, in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the CMN, monetary policy will act in order to redirect price dynamics and, therefore, ensure the target to be fulfilled
Renewed growth in industrial production coupled with expanded exports of manufactured goods are the factors that explain the 22.5 growth under imports of raw materials and intermediate goods
The inflation trajectory has clearly reflected productivity gains and upward movement in the value of the dollar against the euro and the yen
The Copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show resistance, which, by the way, has been slightly above the level which was previously anticipated
The recent behavior of inflation confirms Copoms perception of a low degree of inertia built into the process of domestic price formation
These numbers benefited from several conjunctural and seasonal factors, such as declines in gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and food prices
According to a Banco Central survey, the expectations of analysts with regard to the major price indices in the first quarter of 2000 point to lower inflation, particularly in general price indices
In the emerging economies, the activity pace has been revised downwards, with highlight for the loss of strength in China
In this context, the Copom believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most adequate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the target
Consumer inflation should rise in the short term due to a temporary food price increase and a partial normalization of some service prices, in a context of a recovery in activity and mobility
The Committee concluded that recent data point to a more moderate pace of growth under aggregate demand, bringing this variable more into line with the growth potential of the economy
The recovery is jeopardized by high energy prices and the Euro appreciation, which affects exports
Nonetheless, after the attacks to the U.S. on September 11, this trajectory reverted, with the spread increasing to 320 bp on September On that date, a higher slope was observed in the whole extension of the curve
Activity level has not completely mirrored the remaining effects of the interest rates cuts implemented in 2007, as well as the effects of the economic activity on inflation have not completely materialized
On the other hand, neither has the situation in the interbank markets of the mature economies reached normality, nor have the developments of this crisis over real economy completely materialized
As stressed in the October Copom minutes, the September core results did not reflect the reversion in the underlying inflation trend but the persisting volatility in these measures
In the Euro Area, fiscal concerns turn the recovery more uncertain, the household consumption shows no consistent signs of reaction, and the economic recovery tends to be slower and uneven
Retail sales performed positively in July
The economic sentiment index increased for the eighth consecutive month, and the composite PMI increased to 52.1 in December, averaging 51.9 in the last quarter of 2013, up from 51.4 in the previous quarter
Although the current monetary policy decision brings the Selic interest rate close to a level that, according to the Copoms opinion, will promote inflation convergence to the target path, the Copom recognizes that it is still not possible to assume, with this decision, the conclusion of the adjustment process initiated in September
As a consequence, labor force increases causing the unemployment rate to rise
Under such circumstances, the majority of the Copom members, taking into account the balance of risks for economic activity and, consequently, for the prospective inflation scenario, as well as the absence of clear evidence of effects over inflation stemming from the depreciation of the exchange rate, in an environment of global reduction of inflationary pressures, has decided, at this moment, to reduce the Selic rate by 100 bps
In the face of this result, Copom evaluated the costs and benefits of accelerating the pace of interest rate hikes, considering the following
In the seasonally adjusted series, consumer credit expanded by an annualized rate of 9.7 in December, in comparison to the month of November, while retail sales increased by 1.25 in the final month of the year
As mentioned in the September Copom Minutes, monthly packaging paper shipments are imprecise as a coincident indicator of the industrial activity, if analyzed apart from the historical series
In this context, the majority of central banks started or intensified monetary easing procedures, based not only on the broadening of the risks of recession, but also on fears of deflation
The deceleration in the economic activity reflects the effect of a sequence of shocks that impacted the Brazilian economy, such as the cooling of global economy growth, the Argentina crisis and the electric energy shocks
In particular, they reiterated the importance of insisting on communicating that there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy
In financial markets, the stock markets of major countries presented divergent trajectories, a fact that was repeated regarding the US dollar exchange rate against other currencies
Still regarding the debate about the current neutral interest rate in the economy, some members raised an additional aspect, related to the recent economic data set
The figure represents increases of 0.3 p.p
Positive growth was observed solely in the production of capital goods
In this sense, recent indicators suggest relative deceleration in the growth paces in the US and China, while the consumer annualized quarterly change recorded negative rates in Japan and in the Euro Area, and cooling in the US
On the one hand, decreasing net exports would act as a factor to restrain aggregate demand
This contributes to increase transparency and by inflation expectations anchored around the and enhance Copoms communications
However, until this moment, Brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets confidence, and, despite not decoupled from external economic developments, Brazilian economy should sustain its growth trajectory, essentially driven by domestic demand
In the labor market, the emphasis was on the acceleration of earnings and the overall income, reinforcing the diagnosis of a dynamic labor market
The data already released for the last months point, in short, to the interruption of the industrial production expansion cycle, mainly due to the deterioration of global economic prospects and its effects over the Brazilian economy
In short, since the end of 2007, inflation has diverged from the targets path
The Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation projections and expectations
The Committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity
By benign environment for prospective inflation, with reducing fundamental uncertainties about the Brazilian anchored expectations
This movement was influenced by several factors, among which the release of high current inflation indices, including different core measures; the upward trajectory of commodities prices in the international market; and uncertainties related to the implementation of the fiscal adjustment announced by the government
The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path
The Committee believes that there has been significant disinflationary progress, in line with what the Committee had anticipated, but there is still a long way to go to anchor expectations and return inflation to the target, which requires serenity and moderation on the conduct of monetary policy
The reduction on Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing industry
The M3 monetary aggregate increased by 5.7 in January, surpassing the reference rate of 4.5
The Committee judges that, although the risk associated with economic slack has increased at the margin, the balance of risks is symmetric
This strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation
Firstly, it assessed that the scenario, marked by resilient economic activity, labor market pressures, positive output gap, an increase in the inflation projections, and deanchored expectations, requires a more contractionary monetary policy
These transmits the economic rationality guiding their effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack decisions
The process of approval and implementation of 4 the necessary adjustments in the economy, Extended Consumer Price Index
Despite the result, the level the installed capacity usage, as calculated by the National Confederation of IndustriesCNI, based on information from twelve States, remained stable between April and May
One should note that these figures were impacted by the greater number of business days in February 2000
above the average rates registered in the same periods of 2004 and 2005, respectively
There are signs of increased credit granting in some lines and reduction in current interest rates on new operations, also helped by an incipient growing appetite of financial institutions to offer credit in some lines
Analysis of industrial production by activity reveals that the growth in production in December reflected increases in 16 of the 23 activities, and growth in all use categories
For 2012, the projection stands above the midpoint target in the benchmark scenario and around the target in the market scenario
Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved
At its most recent meeting held on January 19, COPOM resolved to maintain the Selic Rate target at 19 per year with no indication of a bias
higher than the forecast in the last The economy continues to operate with a high paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate level of economic slack, reflected in industrial extracted from the Focus survey
Inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the advanced economies; and, in the emerging ones, it stands at higher levels
There is some consensus that the subprime mortgages crisis will hit the real sector of US economy and affect the countrys growth, but the consequences over global economy tend to be less important
Copoms inflation projections have been reduced, especially in the relevant scenario, to a large extent due to lower inflation expectations
The Committee assesses that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly felt
However, most of the Copom members considered that the domestic and, mainly, the external uncertainties, justify to keep on monitoring the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, to then define the next steps in its monetary policy strategy
Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and demand
With this background, the On the one hand, economic slack may continue to environment for emerging economies has become produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation challenging, despite the additional provision of trajectory
For example, a supply shock with a one percentage point impact on the price level would imply an increase of one point in the twelve-month inflation rate
The Copom will be prepared to change the pace and magnitude of the monetary adjustment process if it assesses that there are risks for the inflation to deviate from the target path
Still in the external scenario, the Committee discussed the causes for the economic activity resilience observed in several economies, concomitantly to the disinflationary process, even in face of historically strong monetary tightening cycles
Regarding the first half of 2012, the projection decreased under the benchmark scenario, although the contrary movement was observed under the market scenario, but under both scenarios the projection is around the inflation midpoint target
The Committee analyzed an alternative scenario with stable interest rates over the entire relevant horizon
On the one hand, household consumption tends to continue expanding, due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion; on the other hand, favorable financial conditions, concessions of public services, expansion of oil exploration areas, among others, create good prospects for investments
Finally, on the balance of risks, the Committee assesses that uncertainty about the final design of the fiscal framework is residual
The future behavior of industrial production recovery, which should not be uniform over time, will depend on these factors, as well as on the gradual recovery of consumer and businessmen confidence, counterbalancing the deterioration of external demand
In the month of February, the harmonized consumer price index closed at 2, the upper limit of the informal target range defined by the European Central Bank
The turbulent environment has reinforced the defensive nature of economic agents reactions to events in Argentina, and, to a lesser extent, to the domestic political environment
This scenario tends to become deepen in the short run, as a function of the recrudescence of American consumer and corporate spending contraction, in response to the attacks on September Nonetheless, the easing, already in progress, of monetary and fiscal policies in the United States should contribute to mitigate the contracting output trend in the medium term, with positive impacts for the world economy
The recovery remains low in Europe, due to the lack of reaction of the domestic demand components in the region, especially in Germany
Regarding regulated prices, in addition to the price increases of gasoline and alcohol-fuel, there were residual effects of the increases in electricity, fixed telephone prices, and urban buses fares that had already pressured the IPCA in July
In short, uncertainty regarding the sustainability of consumption expansion in mature economies still remains, mainly in Europe, in a scenario of withdrawal of economic policy stimuli and modest prospects for credit expansion, but the recovery shows some consolidation
The PMI of the industrial sector regarding Brazil indicates new improvement in October
Still regarding international financial markets, the Copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities prices
The Committee removed residual uncertainty about the approval of the fiscal framework from its balance of risks but noted in its discussion that fiscal dynamics remained relevant in its reference scenario
The Copom inflation forecast for the same period is below this figure
Risks of global economic deceleration are increasing, reinforced by the downward revisions for 2008 global growth
