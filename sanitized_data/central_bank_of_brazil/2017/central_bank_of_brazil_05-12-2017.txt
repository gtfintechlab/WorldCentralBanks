This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey retreated to around 3.0 percent for Expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 remain around 4.0 percent, 4.25 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.
All members agreed that the economy remains on a gradual recovery path, with improvements in employment even at this early stage of the process.
This conjuncture has led to increases in growth projections for the current year and for 2018, consistent with a view that the recovery is more consolidated.
The Committee emphasized the vision that, owing to the current levels of slack in the economy, marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for inflation.
Regarding the global outlook, the Committee confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the global economy, which shows a gradual economic recovery, without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced economies.
The Committee acknowledged that the continuing process of normalization of monetary policy in major countries led to slightly less accommodative global financial conditions, despite the limited impact on the emerging economies so far.
In this context, the Copom reaffirmed that the Brazilian economy shows greater capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global economy, given its robust balance of payments, low inflation environment, anchored expectations and prospects of economic recovery.
All around 4.0 percent, 4.25 percent and 4.0 percent, members agreed that the economy remains on a respectively.
The Under these assumptions, the Copoms inflation Committee acknowledged that the continuing projections stand around 2.9 percent for 2017, 4.2 process of normalization of monetary policy in major percent for 2018, and 4.2 percent for countries led to slightly less accommodative global financial conditions, despite the limited impact on The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and all members agreed that the prospects for inflation, to a large extent, have evolved as expected.
The Committee assessed the current situation of the domestic electric power generation sector and incorporated the recent changes in tariffs into its baseline scenario for inflation for the next year.
In the aggregate, administered prices have constituted an inflationary shock.
In the opposite direction, and in a substantially greater magnitude, the dynamics of food prices constitute a relevant disinflationary shock.
With the prospect of a 5 percent price reduction in the year, the food at home component measured by the IPCA explains a large share of the inflation deviation from the 4.5 percent target set for the current year.
Regarding monetary policy, there was consensus that, as in the case of other possible relative price adjustments resulting from supply shocks, with anchored inflation expectations, monetary policy should only address the second-round effects of these shocks.
The Committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices, such as in food and possible adjustments of electric power tariffs, will be symmetric, that is to say, monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply shocks.
The Copom discussed the levels and the path of inflation, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy.
Some measures of underlying inflation were considered to be at comfortable levels while others at low levels.
The Committee also discussed the extent to which their trajectories are compatible with the convergence of inflation towards the target, within the relevant horizon for monetary policy.
Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, Committee members expressed an understanding that current _ex-ante_ real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy.
The Copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate.
The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time.
The Committee understands that, for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle, the pace of easing depends on the stage of the cycle, without necessarily reflecting changes in its baseline scenario or risk balance.
The Committee then discussed the next step in conducting monetary policy.
On the one hand, they evaluated that several measures of underlying inflation are at comfortable or low levels, including the components that are most sensitive to the economic cycle and monetary policy, and reflected on the path of inflation towards the target.
On the other hand, they pondered on the risk that the current inflationary environment may be interrupted by a frustration of expectations on the continuity of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian economy, particularly in a context of reversal of the current favorable external scenario for emerging economies.
However, they deemed appropriate to warn that this view is more susceptible to changes in the evolution of the scenario and associated risks than in previous meetings.
The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory Although estimates of this rate involve a high throughout this and subsequent years and all degree of uncertainty, Committee members members agreed that the prospects for inflation, to expressed an understanding that current _ex-ante_ a large extent, have evolved as expected.

The Committee also discussed the external scenario for emerging economies.
There was The Committee expressed the view that consensus in maintaining freedom of action and to economic conditions with anchored inflation signal that the current stage of the cycle expectations, measures of underlying inflation recommends caution in conducting monetary policy.
The Committee reaffirmed its preference for communicating conditionalities on the evolution of monetary policy, which better transmits the economic rationality that guides its decisions.
This contributes to increase transparency and improve Copom communication.
In this context, it was once again highlighted that the easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle length, and on inflation projections and expectations.
All Committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the Brazilian economy are fundamental for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the economy, with widespread benefits for society.
Finally, the Copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy and improvements in the business environment.
These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the Brazilian economy.
The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process.
The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level.
The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate.
The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time.
Committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time the Copom views an additional moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate.
Going forward, the Committee judges that the current stage of the cycle recommends caution in conducting monetary policy.
The Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation projections and expectations.

Finally, the Copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy and improvements in the business environment.
Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 7.0 percent per year, without bias.
The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process.
