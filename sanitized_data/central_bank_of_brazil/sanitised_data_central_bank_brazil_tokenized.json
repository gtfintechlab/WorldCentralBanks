        "In short, the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor market and accommodation at the margin.",
        "For the upcoming months, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth and by moderate credit expansion.",
        "In the global economy, prospects for low growth for a long period in important advanced economies remain and there was some accommodation in the volatility and risk aversion indicators.",
        "High unemployment rates, coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties, are translated into projections of low growth for advanced economies, mainly in Europe.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, advanced economies have persisted with strongly accommodative stances.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, monetary policy is expansionist.",
        "Inflation has remained at moderate levels in the US and in the Euro Area, and negative in Japan.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, based on the 360-day swap rates, on the baseline scenario, estimates 45 bps and 32 bps spreads for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2014, respectively.",
        "The set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last years.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longer-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant, to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "The Copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the Brazilian economy, which determined retreat in interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction in risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the ninth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",
        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these transformations are characterized by high degree of persistence - although, due to the economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur - and contribute for the Brazilian economys current solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments, have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate.",
        "In this context, despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in international financial markets, the Committee considers that the external environment remains complex.",
        "The Committee evaluates that, in general, the prospects for moderate global activity remained unchanged.",
        "In mature economies, the space to use monetary policy seems to be limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the next years.",
        "In important emerging economies, however, the activity pace has intensified, supported by the resilience of domestic demand.",
        "The Committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of international commodities prices.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity - less intense than previously anticipated - is essentially due to limitations regarding the supply side.",
        "Given their nature, therefore, these 5 impediments cannot be addressed by monetary policy actions, which are, _par excellence, demand control_ tools.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee highlights that recent information points to the investment resumption and to a growth path more aligned with potential growth.",
        "Moreover, the Committee notices that domestic demand will continue to be boosted by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, as well as by the moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate.",
        "Additionally, domestic activity will continue to be favored by public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, which is reflected in historically low unemployment rates and in wage growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the reduction trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long terms.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit market.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that its main scenario includes more intense domestic activity this year.",
        "In this context, the Committee highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and it considers that, under such circumstances, a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "Furthermore, the Copom emphasizes moderation recently observed in the prices dynamics of some real and financial assets, which, in the assumption of remaining at the current levels, will constitute important disinflationary strength.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the greater dispersion of consumer price increases recently observed, seasonal pressures and pressures localized in the transportation segment, among other factors, contribute for inflation to show resistance.",
        "Although this unfavorable dynamics may not represent a temporary phenomenon, but a possible accommodation of inflation at a higher level, the Committee considers that remaining uncertainties stemming from foreign and domestic fronts - surround the prospective scenario and recommend that monetary policy should be administered with caution.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show robustness, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming semesters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, which are, in short, lagged and cumulative.",
        "For the Committee, these effects, the programs of public services concession, the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of businessmens confidence create prospects for investment intensification.",
        "The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector in expansionist position.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee notes that the still fragile international scenario represents an aggregate demand restraining factor.",
        "These elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the international evidence, in which it is ratified by the Brazilian experience, shows that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress investment.",
        "These distortions are manifested, for example, in the shortening the planning horizons of households, businesses and governments, as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over households confidence and consumption.",
        "Therefore, high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the economy, as well as of jobs and income generation.",
        "The tenure related to individuals increased 2.3 months and 18.4 months, according to the same comparison bases, and that related to the corporate segment fell 0.6 month-onmonth and increased 13.6 months year-over-year, reaching 125.3 months for individuals and 60.5 months for corporate.",

        "The housing market remains in recovery.",
        "Notwithstanding, the last indicators of industrial production, for December 2012, and of economic sentiment, relative to February 2013, showed improvement.",
        "In Japan, the contraction in the last quarter of 2012 was influenced by the declines in business investment, exports and change in private inventories.",
        "However, industrial production, which rose in three of the last four months through January; the trade flow, which in January reported the first year-over-year growth in eight months; and the February Manufacturing PMI, increasing for the second consecutive month, suggest improvement in economic conditions.",
        "In China, despite the marginal deceleration of GDP, the average of the monthly growth rates of fixed asset investment, industrial production and retail sales increased in the fourth quarter, quarter-over-quarter.",
        "The Composite PMI, after increasing for five consecutive months, dropped to 51.4 in February.",
        "Stock exchanges recorded distinct behaviors, with most indexes referring to the developed economies booming, especially the Nikkei, from Japan, and the ones relative to emerging economies, going down.",
        "Regarding international commodity prices, there were reductions in most of it.",
        "Among agricultural commodities, it bears highlighting the reduction in the prices of sugar, coffee, corn and wheat, and the increase in cotton.",
        "In the other economies, the rates also remained at the previous levels, except for Colombia, Hungary, India and Poland, which reduced their basic rates.",
        "Among the factors underpinning this movement, it bears highlighting, on the domestic scenario, the disclosure of more pressured price indices and the market expectation for the start of the Selic target increase cycle.",
        "The rates for one-, two- and three-years maturities increased by 0.62 p.p., 0.70 p.p.",
        "The BCB also conducted very short-term operations on 32 occasions, being a borrower in 31 of them.",
        "It also conducted leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of two working days.",
        "The main factors that contributed to the contraction of liquidity in the period were the net revenues of the Government and the net issuance of securities by the National Treasury.",

        "The PMI of the industrial sector regarding Brazil indicates new improvement in October.",
        "In short, the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor market, although there are some signs of moderation at the margin.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit expansion.",
        "In the global economy, a scenario of low growth prospects in important advanced economies prevails, notably in the Euro Zone, but, overall, a more benign scenario is anticipated for the upcoming year.",
        "High unemployment rates in Europe, coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties, are translated into investment retreat and in low growth.",

        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, based on the 360-day swap rates, on the baseline scenario, estimates 103 bps and 5 bps spreads for the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, respectively.",
        "For the third quarter of 2015, the inflation forecast stands above the target in both scenarios.",

        "Despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial markets, the Committee considers that the external environment remains complex.",
        "The Committee evaluates that, in general, the prospects for moderate global activity this year have remained, with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for the monetary policy.",
        "There are improvements in advanced economies, although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming years.",
        "In important emerging economies, however, the activity pace has not matched the expectations, despite the resilience of domestic demand.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming year.",
        "Recent information indicate resumption of investments and continuity of household consumption growth, the latter favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor market - which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth.",
        "In general, domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than GDP growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy actions, by the expansion of credit supply, by the program of public services concessions, and by the program of permission for oil exploration, among other factors.",
        "Regarding the external component of the aggregate demand, the main scenario anticipates a more benign trajectory than that registered in recent years.",
        "However, the Committee notes that the speed of materialization of these expected gains depends on the confidence strengthening of companies and households.",
        "The Copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "For the Committee, conditions are created so that, in the relevant horizon for monetary policy, the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral zone.",
        "The Committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections, on the one hand, would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates; on the other hand, it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long terms.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion.",
        "Still regarding the credit market, the Committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit operations.",

        "The Committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters enable a natural and expected correction in relative prices.",
        "For the Committee, these movements in the local currency market, to some extent, reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards normality, among other dimensions, in terms of liquidity and interest rates.",
        "It is also important to highlight that, 5 for the Committee, the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter periods.",
        "However, the secondary effects stemming from it, and that would tend to materialize over longer periods, can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy handling.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show resistance.",
        "In this context, the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic agents perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also included.",
        "Considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the decision-making process on consumption and investment, in the Committees view, it is necessary that, with the due promptness, it is reverted.",
        "In this context, the Committee considers that it is appropriate to continue the ongoing adjustment pace of the monetary conditions.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively robust.",
        "On the one hand, household consumption tends to continue expanding, due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion; on the other hand, favorable financial conditions, concessions of public services, expansion of oil exploration areas, among others, create good prospects for investments.",
        "However, the Committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining factor, despite the prospects of progress in the relevant horizon.",

        "Therefore, high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the economy, as well as of jobs and income generation.",
        "The Copom highlights that, in moments such as the current one, the monetary policy should remain especially vigilant, in order to minimize risks that high inflation rates, such as the one observed in the last twelve months, persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, the Committee considers that the transmission of the effects of monetary policy actions over inflation occurs with lags.",
        "There were declines of 1.1 p.p.",

        "In the opposite direction, the central banks of India and Indonesia raised their basic interest rates.",
        "Focusing on the domestic environment, the market expectations for the continuity of the adjustment cycle of the basic rate, concerns about the fiscal policy stance and rumors of revision of Brazil's credit rating by the rating agencies, influenced the increase of the rates.",
        "Externally, the expected change in the US monetary policy, the global appreciation of the dollar and the rising rates of the US Treasury bonds contributed to this movement.",

        "The Committee recognizes that these 5 adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on inflation and reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from them.",
        "By the way, in order to fight these and other inflationary pressures, in the last twelve months, the monetary conditions were tightened, but the Committee evaluates that the effects of the Selic rates hikes on inflation are, in part, yet to materialize.",

        "On the one hand, the additional interest rate increase would reinforce the vigilance stance and reflect the observation of a stronger than expected activity.",
        "On the other hand, caution and the need to evaluate, over time, the cumulative effects to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken would be in favor of the maintenance.",
        "The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "These members argued that the additional increase would strengthen the Committees message of commitment to its strategy, given the rise in inflation expectations and the projection in the reference scenario for 2024, in an environment of uncertainty about the level of the output gap and the dynamics of activity.",
        "These members consider that the upside risks listed in the balance of risks may have longer- lasting impacts if they materialize, suggesting additional caution in assessing the reference scenario projections for the year The Committee unanimously emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",
        "The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",

        "The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "Furthermore, the war in Ukraine impacts the supply of natural gas, thus bringing additional uncertainty to the European economic scenario, whereas, in China, the deterioration of the real estate sector, coupled with the policy to fight Covid-19, negatively impact the countrys growth prospects.",
        "Inflation rates figures in some advanced economies released in the period suggest the persistence of strong pressures, although an incipient normalization in the supply chains and accommodation in the prices of leading commodities is already observed recently.",
        "Coupled with the adjustment of inventories of industrial goods, these developments might imply the moderation of inflationary pressures related to goods.",
        "On the other hand, the degree of slack in the labor market in these economies suggests that inflationary pressures in the sector of services might take long to dissipate.",
        "Central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased inflation.",
        "The acceleration in the process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies, the increase in risk aversion, and the change in the growth outlook have impacted financial conditions in both advanced and emerging economies, affecting the volatility of assets and economic growth prospects.",

        "Indicators related to both formal job openings and employment and unemployment rates suggest a rapid normalization in the labor-intensive sectors after the pandemic.",
        "Consumer inflation remains high, with increases spread among several components, and continues to be more persistent than anticipated.",
        "The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the global inflationary scenario is still challenging.",
        "Pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for goods, as well as supply shocks linked to the war in Ukraine, China's Covid-19 policy, and policies restricting trade in agricultural products in commodity-producing countries, might have long-term consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the re- evaluation of future global demand has led to price declines of leading commodities as well as the prospects of reduced imbalance in the industrial goods market.",
        "Copom, even so, reiterates that some geopolitical and particular issues in these markets still deserve attention.",
        "The Committee discussed the impacts of the global synchrony in the process of stimulus withdrawal.",
        "Copom noticed a more accelerated pace in the process of monetary policy adjustment in advanced economies, as well as the commitment stated in the communication of major central banks to reduce inflationary pressures.",
        "It was observed that this movement elevated the market volatility, unevenly impacting several assets and increasing risk aversion.",
        "In addition, given the persistence of the inflationary process in advanced economies and the consequent responses by several central banks, the Committee evaluates that the probability of alternative scenarios incorporating a sharper deceleration of global economic activity increased.",
        "The uncertainty about the energy scenario in Europe, the dynamics of sectors more sensitive to interest rates in the United States, and the prospects of a more gradual growth in China contribute to this scenario.",
        "In the domestic scenario, Copom evaluates that temporary policies aimed to support income could provide stimulus to aggregate demand and the extension of these policies might increase the countrys risk premia and inflation expectations as they pressure aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal trajectory.",
        "The Committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect inflation, including its effect on activity, asset prices, and inflation expectations.",
        "Labor market data, especially concerning the pace of job openings and the unemployment rate, surprised in the period and indicate a faster-than-anticipated narrowing of the estimate of the output gap.",
        "However, the Committee evaluates that economic slackness persists.",
        "Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that evaluations about the output gap, especially about the component related to the labor market, are always subject to uncertainty, notably in the current situation in which the economy is still normalizing after the pandemic and with remarkable heterogeneity across sectors in this process.",
        "Copom will continue monitoring and evaluating the output gap in the next releases.",
        "The Committee still considers that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly felt.",
        "It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee assesses that the possibility that fiscal policies that support aggregate demand become permanent heightens the upside risks of the inflationary scenario.",
        "The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the prospective risks.",
        "Therefore, the Committee decided to emphasize the projections for 12-month inflation in the first quarter of 2024, which reflects the relevant horizon, smoothens out the primary effects from tax changes, but incorporates their second-round effects on the relevant inflation projections for monetary policy decisions.",
        "The 12-month inflation projection for the first quarter of 2024 which incorporates the secondary effects of the tax changes as well as the cumulative effects of keeping interest rates at a significantly contractionary level is consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon.",
        "The Committee noted that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target.",
        "It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to the long and variable monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen.",
        "These impacts should become clearer in the activity indicators for the second half of the year, but the Committee anticipates that measures to sustain aggregate demand, which will be implemented in the short term, may make it difficult a more precise evaluation about the stage of the economic cycle and the impacts of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee noted that the short-term inflationary dynamics remains challenging, with increasing core inflation measures in an environment of surprises in current activity, and that its projections continued to deteriorate, even though the scenario is surrounded by uncertainty and volatility above the usual.",
        "It was emphasized that the rise in expectations and medium-term projections was concentrated in the inflation of administered prices, due to the temporary nature of some tax measures.",
        "Moreover, given the persistence of recent shocks, the Committee will remain vigilant and will assess whether the prospect of maintaining the Selic rate by itself for a sufficiently long period will ensure such a convergence.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",
        "The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory.",

        "The Copom emphasizes that it will remain vigilant and that future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets.",
        "It also stresses that the uncertainty of the current scenario, both domestic and foreign ones, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its cumulative impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions.",
        "Because of the potential persistence of the inflationary pressure, the repricing of monetary policy in advanced countries has impacted financial conditions in emerging countries.",

        "Recent readings were higher than expected, and the surprise came on both the more volatile components and the items associated with core inflation.",
        "As for the more volatile components, the increase of gasoline prices is still noteworthy, with greater and faster impact than anticipated.",
        "May 3-4 The Committee opened its debate about the risks regarding its projections by discussing some of the likely explanations for the difference between the projection in its reference scenario and the analysts projections.",
        "Some members emphasized that high current inflation has contaminated longer-term expectations beyond what was expected.",
        "Moreover, some additional likely explanations have been discussed through the analysis of alternative scenarios.",
        "Firstly, Copom analyzed the impact of a slower reversion in industrial goods inflation, due to successive shocks on global production chains.",
        "In addition, Copom also observed that different assumptions about the neutral interest rate have an impact on its projections, albeit modest at the relevant horizon.",
        "Finally, inflationary impacts stemming from different assumptions about the convergence between the prices of oil and its by-products have also seemed relevant.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee evaluated that there is still high uncertainty about the prospective trajectory of commodity prices in local currency, because of the war in Ukraine and the economic recovery in the post-pandemic period.",
        "Copom assesses that there is a possibility of reversion, even if partial, of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency.",
        "The Committee has debated the fiscal risk and how it affects the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Uncertainties regarding the future of the current fiscal framework result in increased risk premia and raises the risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "This movement is already seen, to some extent, and is already partially incorporated in the longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey, as well as in the prices of several domestic assets.",
        "The Committee emphasized that the appropriate level of monetary tightening is also dependent on the prevailing fiscal framework.",
        "Weaknesses in the structural reform effort, as well as permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the neutral interest rate.",
        "The Committee evaluated the risks around the reference scenario for economic growth in 2022 and The Committee highlighted that economic growth came in line with expectations, but the tightening of financial conditions brings a risk of greater- than-anticipated deceleration in the quarters ahead, when its impacts tend to be more evident.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its inflation scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the risks.",
        "It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen.",
        "Still, Copom noted that an additional deterioration was observed in both the short- term inflationary dynamics and the longer-term projections, even though the scenario is characterized by higher than usual uncertainty and volatility.",
        "The Committee concluded that a further adjustment of 1.00 percentage point was appropriate.",
        "Copom members then discussed how to signal the future monetary policy.",
        "This strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant projection horizon, as well as the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, while reflects the already implemented monetary tightening, reinforces the cautious monetary policy stance and emphasizes the uncertain scenario.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",

        "The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy.",
        "Negative growth revisions were also noted for China, partially reflecting the zero-Covid policy adopted by that country.",
        "Central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased inflation, although, in some of these economies, current interest rates are still at levels evaluated as expansionary.",
        "The repricing of monetary policy in advanced economies, the increase in risk aversion, and the change in the growth outlook have affected financial conditions in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "The Committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment.",
        "Indicators related to the labor market continue to recover and the release of the 2022Q1 GDP pointed to a higher-than-expected pace of activity, raising the statistical carry-over for this year.",
        "Household consumption continues to contribute positively, while, in 2022Q1, Gross Fixed Capital Formation contributed negatively.",
        "Consumer inflation remains high, with increases spread among several components, and continues to be more persistent than anticipated.",
        "The inflation of services and of industrial goods remain high, and the recent shocks continue to cause a strong increase in food and fuel-related components.",
        "Recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and on items associated with core inflation.",
        "The Committee assesses that the global inflationary scenario continues to be marked by inflationary pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for goods and supply shocks linked to the war in Ukraine and China's Covid-19 policy.",
        "The Committee further believes that recent policies restricting trade in agricultural products in commodity-producing countries, coupled with the effects of the war in Ukraine, bring additional risk to global inflationary pressures.",
        "In the Copoms view, these developments might have long-term consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures.",
        "The Committee then discussed the growing risks involving a sharper global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment.",
        "The Committee already anticipates a slowdown in global activity in the coming quarters, due to geopolitical tensions and the monetary policy tightening, as well as financial conditions underway in several central economies.",
        "The Committee believes that the global synchrony in the process of stimulus withdrawal introduces additional risks to markets and may boost its impact on the prospective scenario.",
        "In this context of global deceleration, Copom considers a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency observed in recent quarters.",
        "The Committee reinforces that uncertainty about the future of the country's fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate demand may bring an upside risk to the inflationary scenario and to inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee believes that recent domestic activity data, which have prompted a positive revision to 2022 growth, still reflect, for the most part, the post-pandemic normalization process of the economy, both in the higher consumption of services and in the utilization of the excess savings observed over historical records, and the transitory fiscal stimulus provided in the first half of the year.",
        "The Committee assesses that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly felt.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",

        "The Committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the risks.",
        "It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen.",
        "It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen.",
        "Still, Copom observed deterioration in both the short-term inflationary dynamics and the longer-term projections, even though the scenario is surrounded by higher than usual uncertainty and volatility.",
        "Thus, the strategy of convergence around the target requires a more contractionary interest rate than that used in the reference scenario for the entire relevant horizon.",
        "Given the persistence of the recent shocks, the Committee evaluated that only the perspective of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period would not assure, at this moment, the convergence of inflation around the target in the relevant horizon.",
        "The Committee then chose to signal a further adjustment, of equal or smaller magnitude.",
        "This strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant horizon, as well as the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, while reflecting the already implemented monetary tightening, reinforcing the cautious monetary policy stance, and emphasizing the uncertainty of the scenario.",

        "Despite the recent reduction, especially on items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high.",
        "Items related to industrial goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration, albeit still slow.",
        "The Committee discussed the speed of the global disinflation process.",
        "On the one hand, the relaxation of pressures on global production chains, as well as the recent drop in commodity prices, indicate that the movement should continue in the short term, especially in the industrial goods, energy, and food segments.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee discussed that, given the spread of inflationary pressures to the services segment, which has a more inertial nature, in an environment of tight labor markets in several countries, the disinflation process should be non-linear and slower than that observed in recent episodes.",
        "Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration.",
        "The Committee discussed two recent facts while analyzing the international markets.",
        "Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debt at historically high levels.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed the lower liquidity present in sovereign bond markets, possibly due to greater uncertainty in the interest rate dynamics, the reversal of long-term asset purchase policies and regulatory changes.",
        "These issues require monitoring and may also impact assets from emerging economies more strongly.",
        "Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of marginal growth.",
        "The release of the third quarter GDP figures indicates a reduction in the pace of growth, especially in some of the more cyclical components.",
        "Nevertheless, growth was observed in all demand components and, in the supply side, growth in industry and services.",
        "Moreover, labor market data also indicate a reduction in the pace of job openings, but still with positive marginal net hirings.",
        "The set of released data, including the drop in confidence indicators and the reduction in credit granting, together with the lagged effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's expectation of a slowdown in the pace of economic activity, which should worsen over the coming quarters.",
        "The inflationary outlook was then discussed, based on the more recent information.",
        "Some members noted the benign movement of commodities in BRL, highlighting additional downside risks ahead.",
        "Other members emphasized the volatile nature of these prices in an environment of pressured inventories.",
        "Finally, all members evaluated that current inflation did not surprise significantly in relation to expectations or substantially changed the understanding about future inflation dynamics.",
        "Moreover, they emphasized that disinflation in services and core inflation components with greater inertia will require increased attention and perseverance in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee discussed extensively the impacts of different fiscal scenarios on inflation.",
        "In its analysis, the Committee reiterated the different channels through which fiscal policy can affect inflation not only via the primary effects of aggregated demand but also via asset prices, the degree of economic uncertainty, inflation expectations, and neutral interest rate.",
        "The Committee evaluated that changes in parafiscal policies or the reversal of structural reforms that lead to a less efficient allocation of resources might reduce the power of monetary policy.",
        "In the different exercises analyzed, it was evaluated that the final effect, either on inflation or on activity, will depend on both the combination and the magnitude of the fiscal and parafiscal policies.",
        "Furthermore, it was highlighted that the existence of economic slack and the confidence in the debt sustainability are determining factors for an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve the aimed impacts on the economic activity.",
        "The Committee believes that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the prospective fiscal scenario and that the moment requires caution in risk assessment.",
        "The Committee reiterates that it will continue to monitor future fiscal policy developments and their potential impacts on prospective inflation dynamics.",
        "It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation.",
        "The 12-month inflation projection for the second quarter of 2024, in the scenario using the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus Survey, remains consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon.",
        "The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of the taxes.",
        "Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target.",
        "This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.",
        "Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first quarter of However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already being disregarded.",
        "Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the projections, inflation expectations, output gap, and the balance of risks.",
        "Copom's inflation projections showed a slight increase over the relevant horizon due to both an increase in the projection for the inflation of market prices in shorter terms and a revision of the projection for the inflation of administered prices over longer terms.",
        "The uncertainty about future fiscal dynamics, and its consequences on inflation dynamics, was discussed, and the uncertain environment was deemed to require serenity in assessing these risks.",
        "Services inflation showed some moderation but remains at high levels, and the Committee believes that the disinflation process of this component will become clearer over time.",
        "Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the cumulative impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken.",
        "The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",
        "The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than- projected inflation in its scenarios.",
        "On the other hand, fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the countrys risk premia.",
        "In spite of the more favorable public accounts data, the Committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations but considers that this risk is being partially incorporated in the inflation expectations and asset prices used in its models.",
        "The Committee maintains the assessment of an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks.",
        "This implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest rates.",
        "This movement is already seen, to some extent, in the longer- term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey, as well as in the risk premia of several domestic assets.",
        "The Committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for sustainable economic growth.",
        "Weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.",
        "The conflict in Europe adds further uncertainty and volatility to the prospective scenario and imposes a relevant supply shock in several commodities.",
        "The Committee considered that the best practice recommends that monetary policy react to the second-round effects of this type of shock, as this practice takes into account the usual lags in the effects of monetary policy.",
        "Copom specifically evaluated the impact on its projections of the assumption for the path of oil prices.",
        "In its usual hypothesis, the price per barrel starts from values around USD 118 in March and rises to around USD 121 by the end of 2023, i.e., extrapolating for the entire relevant horizon of monetary policy the oil price resulting from a particularly unusual global situation.",
        "The Committee noted that the current environment of high uncertainty and volatility demands serenity for the evaluation of the long-term impacts of the current shock, and therefore, decided to compare this assumption with the prices of oil future contracts negotiated in international markets as well as projections from the energy sector's agencies.",
        "The Committee observed that both converged to a price per barrel below USD 100 by the end of Copom then concluded that it would be appropriate to keep the usual assumption in the reference scenario, but to assume as more likely a scenario with an alternative assumption for the path of oil prices until the end of As of 2023, the Committee decided to stick to its more conservative assumptions.",
        "The Committee considers that the disclosure of an alternative scenario is particularly useful and informative in a highly uncertain environment.",
        "Next, Copom discussed the implementation of monetary policy, considering the relative probabilities of the scenarios evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation.",
        "Hence, considering this bias due to asymmetric risks, Copom evaluated that its projections are above the upper limit of the target tolerance band for 2022 and still around the target for Considering these results and the Committee's evaluation regarding the probability of each scenario, Copom considered that, at this moment, a monetary tightening cycle similar to the one used in its scenarios is the most adequate.",
        "The projected interest rate path implies a significantly restrictive monetary policy stance, which will mainly impact inflation for 2023, and is compatible with tackling second-round effects of the current supply shock.",
        "However, should the prospective scenario prove to be closer to that observed in the reference scenario, the Committee believes that this cycle should be even more restrictive.",
        "Next, Copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate hikes.",
        "For such, it analyzed its inflation projections using simulations with monetary policy paths with different terminal rates, adjustment paces, and duration of monetary tightening.",
        "Given the volatility and uncertainty of the current environment, particularly in the global scenario, the Committee opted for a timelier interest rate trajectory than that embedded in its scenarios.",
        "This preference expresses caution regarding the probabilities awarded to its scenarios and the measurement of second-round effects, as well as its commitment to the convergence of inflation and expectations to its targets over the relevant horizon.",
        "Based on these results, Copom members discussed the most appropriate strategy.",
        "The Committee concluded that a further adjustment of 1.00 percentage point, followed by an additional adjustment at the same pace, is the most appropriate strategy to achieve sufficient monetary tightening and to ensure inflation convergence over the relevant horizon, as well as the anchoring of long-term expectations.",
        "However, the Committee recognizes the challenging scenario for the convergence of inflation to its targets and reinforces that it will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening cycle, should the scenario evolve unfavorably.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, mainly, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",
        "The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into an even more restrictive territory.",
        "The Committees actions aim at curbing the second-round effects of the current supply shock in several commodities, which appear in inflation in a lagged manner.",
        "The current projections indicate that the interest rate cycle in its scenarios is sufficient for inflation convergence to levels around the target over the relevant horizon.",
        "The Copom judges that the moment requires serenity to assess the size and duration of the current shocks.",
        "If those shocks prove to be more persistent or larger than anticipated, the Committee will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening cycle.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy.",
        "The Copom members analyzed the recent performance and prospects for the Brazilian and international economies, under the monetary policy framework, whose objective is to comply with the inflation targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In case of inconsistency, the Portuguese version prevails.",
        "More persistent inflation raises the chances of faster monetary tightening in the US, turning financial conditions more challenging for emerging economies.",
        "In addition, the recent Covid-19 wave adds uncertainty about the pace of activity, and at the same time could delay the normalization of global supply chains.",
        "Turning to the Brazilian economic activity, trade and services indicators showed a slightly better-than-expected evolution in November, while industry recovered in December.",
        "Labor market indicators showed consistent job recovery in 2021Q4.",
        "For 2022, if, on the one hand, the rise in risk premia and the more intense tightening of financial conditions act stifling the economic activity, on the other hand Copom still considers that economic growth tends to benefit from the performance of agriculture and livestock and from the remaining effects of the normalization process of the economy, particularly in the services sector and in the labor market.",
        "Consumer inflation remains high, with increases spread among several components, and continues to be more persistent than anticipated.",
        "The increase of industrial prices has not slowed down and should persist in the short term, while services inflation accelerated, still reflecting the gradual normalization in the sectors activity.",
        "Recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and particularly on the items associated with core inflation.",
        "These pressures were only partially offset by the change in the hypothesis of the energy flag for the end of 2022, which reflected the improved rainfall scenario.",
        "On the other hand, fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the countrys risk premia.",
        "In spite of the more favorable public accounts data, the Committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations and, therefore, the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks.",
        "This implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the reference scenario.",
        "This implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest rates.",
        "The Committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic growth.",
        "Weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.",
        "Additionally, the Committee notes that even fiscal policies that have a downward effect on inflation in the short term can cause a deterioration in the country's risk premia, increase inflation expectations, and consequently have an upward effect on prospective inflation.",
        "Next, Copom discussed the implementation of monetary policy, considering not only the reference scenario, but also the balance of risks for inflation.",
        "According to the reference scenario, which uses the interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and the exchange rate evolving according to the purchasing power parity, the inflation projections are above the upper limit of the tolerance band of the target for 2022, and around the target for As for the balance of risks, the Committee pondered that the risk of deanchoring longer-term expectations, derived from developments in the fiscal scenario, sustains an upward bias for the projections of its reference scenario.",
        "Hence, considering this bias due to asymmetric risks, Copom evaluated that its projections are above the target for both 2022 and Therefore, Copom once more concluded that the monetary tightening process should be more restrictive than that used in the reference scenario throughout the relevant horizon.",
        "Next, Copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate hikes.",
        "For such, it analyzed its inflation projections using simulations with monetary policy paths with different terminal rates, adjustment paces, and duration of monetary tightening.",
        "It is worth noting that the scenarios considered, consistent with the convergence of inflation to its targets, assumed a higher interest rate path than that used in the reference scenario.",
        "Based on these results, Copom members discussed the most appropriate strategy.",
        "The Committee concluded that another adjustment of 1.50 percentage points, followed by additional adjustments at a slower pace in the next meetings, is the most appropriate strategy to achieve sufficient monetary tightening and ensure inflation convergence over the relevant horizon, as well as the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.",
        "Finally, the particularly high uncertainty surrounding important asset and commodity prices, as well as the stage of the tightening cycle, led the Committee to judge more appropriate, at this moment, not to signal the size of its future steps.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects its reference scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, to a larger degree, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.",
        "The Committee considers that, given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of deanchoring long-term expectations, it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive territory.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate.",
        "For its next steps, the Committee foresees as adequate, at this moment, a reduction in the pace of adjustment of the interest rate.",
        "This indication reflects the stage of the tightening cycle as its cumulative effects will manifest themselves over the relevant horizon.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy.",
        "The labor market continues to recover, but at a slower pace than in previous months.",
        "Despite the recent reduction, driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high.",
        "The recent releases have been strongly influenced by the reduction in administered prices, due to both the decrease in taxes and, to a lesser extent, the drop in international fuel prices.",
        "In addition, items related to industrial goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration.",
        "The Committee still considers that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations raise the risk of a more pronounced global slowdown.",
        "There has been an adjustment in the extent and speed of the monetary policy tightening cycle in some advanced countries, which has led to a further tightening of financial conditions.",
        "The Committee noted a stronger market sensitivity to developments affecting the fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies.",
        "The combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debts at historically high levels, raises questions about the sustainability of public debt in several countries.",
        "Besides, the lower liquidity of the sovereign securities markets increases risk perception and demand monitoring.",
        "Data on economic activity, which contribute to the assessment of the degree of slack, point to a more moderate pace of growth recently.",
        "On the one hand, the momentum of the reopening of the economy in the services sector and the fiscal stimuli are still driving consumption growth, although these impulses should slow down.",
        "On the other hand, the impact of monetary policy and its lags point to a reduction in the pace of economic activity, which tends to worsen in the coming quarters.",
        "The Committee discussed the already noticeable impacts of monetary policy on credit and economic activity data.",
        "One can notice an impact in recent data regarding both the composition of new household credit operations and the moderate increase in the delinquency rate, partly related to the behavior of the real disposable income, which suggests some reduction.",
        "The Committee observed that an additional challenge for the proper assessment of the dynamics of activity at the margin is in the seasonal adjustment of the series, especially of the indicators with a shorter sample period, due to the pandemic period.",
        "Exercises show a high sensitivity of the signal and the magnitude of the seasonally adjusted results to small changes in the samples and methods used.",
        "In the domestic scenario, Copom believes that the permanent increase in spending and the uncertainty about its trajectory from next year on may increase the country's risk premia and inflation expectations as they put pressure on aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal path expectations.",
        "The Committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect inflation, including its effect on activity, asset prices, degree of uncertainty in the economy, and inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of the taxes.",
        "Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target.",
        "This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.",
        "Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first quarter of However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already being disregarded.",
        "Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the projections, inflation expectations, and the balance of risks.",
        "Inflation projections showed a slight increase at longer horizons, reflecting upward revisions for inflation of market prices in the short term and a small increase in the projection for administered prices.",
        "The Committee assesses that the projections remain at values consistent with the strategy of reaching a level around the target over the relevant horizon.",
        "Inflation expectations from the Focus survey showed a more pronounced drop at shorter horizons but remains relatively stable for longer ones.",
        "Risks remain high, requiring continuous monitoring and serenity in their assessment.",
        "Regarding the degree of slack in the domestic economy, the Committee continues to monitor different metrics and strategies for the assessment of the output gap, as well as for current and prospective activity, and considers that there has been some decrease in the estimated slack since its latest update.",
        "Copom reinforces that its projection incorporates an increase in slack throughout the monetary policy horizon, as a result of the monetary adjustment undertaken in recent quarters.",
        "Finally, the Committee is following with special attention the evolution of services inflation, which depends on both inflationary inertia and the output gap, and whose trajectory will become clearer over time.",
        "Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the accumulated impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken.",
        "The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",

        "The inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy stood above the inflation target in the most recent releases.",
        "The scenario marked by a sound U.S. economy and resilient inflation permeates the debate on the sources, challenges, and uncertainties for the future disinflationary process in that country.",
        "Regarding sources, the Committee discussed the role of the normalization of productive chains and the consequent benign recomposition of relative prices between goods and services, the slowdown of commodity prices, Chinese disinflation and, to a greater extent, the role of monetary policy in the U.S. in reducing inflation in a sustained manner.",
        "It was pointed out that, as in the Brazilian case, the final stage of disinflation is more costly and requires caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Still in the subject, Copom reaffirmed that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate, and that, as usual, it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment into the domestic inflationary dynamics.",
        "Regarding the challenges of the external scenario, in addition to geopolitical tensions, some subjects were mentioned.",
        "Firstly, the speed of disinflation in a scenario of strong activity and a resilient labor market has once again become the subject of much debate, besides, for a longer horizon, the role of fiscal impacts on the aggregate demand and provision of liquidity and the channeling of credit resources to the economy.",
        "In addition, it will continue to monitor the data from the global economy and their respective transmission channels to the domestic economy.",
        "Regarding the domestic economic activity, Copom firstly debated the release of GDP for 2023Q4, especially emphasizing the growth composition of demand components.",
        "A reduction in the growth impetus of household consumption compared with the previous quarters and to auxiliary monthly surveys was noticed.",
        "When assessing consumption over the recent years, the prevailing view was, even so, that consumption was sustained by the labor market dynamics, both at the employment and wages level, the increased social benefits, the slow deleveraging of households and, lastly, the disinflationary process that favors the expansion of real disposable income.",
        "For the prospective scenario, due to the factors mentioned above, as well as to the increase of the minimum wage, the reduction of the impact of the monetary tightening over time, fiscal transfers, and the recovering stage of the credit cycle, the assessment that consumption will continue resilient persists.",
        "Furthermore, Copom mentioned that some high frequency indicators would allow a reading that corroborates this argument, including some surprise in the more recent releases of services and trade surveys, raising the growth projection for the quarter.",
        "The Committee also discussed the reasons for the drop in investment momentum over 2023, highlighting increased uncertainty and restrictive financial conditions.",
        "The Committee noticed that the increased appetite for credit granting as well as lower interest rates and the easing of financial conditions suggest a more favorable scenario for investment over 2024, as already observed in 2023Q4.",
        "In short, released activity data reinforce the perception of a scenario characterized by economic activity resilience, although no substantial change was observed in the growth prospect.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "The Committee discussed thoroughly the labor market and assessed that the current wage increases may be linked to some extent to pressures in the labor market.",
        "Some members recalled that, over the latest meetings, the Committee has emphasized data relative to earnings, as there remains a wide debate about the tightness of the labor market in view of methodological issues regarding employment surveys, the pandemic impacts, and the labor reform.",
        "Some members perceived that the productivity recovery in 2023 mostly occurred in agriculture and livestock, while pressures on earnings were widespread, suggesting that pressured earnings should not be mainly explained by productivity gains, but by the narrowing of the output gap.",
        "In its analysis, the Committee was therefore more concerned about the possible effects of increased real gains in the more recent period and the growth acceleration seen in overall income data on the prospective dynamics of services inflation.",
        "The Committee continued its discussion on the relationship between the labor market and prices in the economy.",
        "It highlighted the reciprocal causality between prices and the income dynamics, their respective lags, and the elasticities of impact of one on the other.",
        "Moreover, Copom stressed that it will continue incorporating labor market data into the analysis with no mechanical or definitive view about any impacts or relationships whatsoever.",
        "Copom will continue to pay attention to the dynamics of income stemming from various surveys to better evaluate the degree of slack in the labor market and its potential impacts on the services inflation.",
        "There are signs of increased credit granting and reduction in current interest rates on new operations, also helped by an incipient growing appetite of financial institutions to offer credit.",
        "On the fiscal front, the Committee reaffirms the importance of firmly pursuing the already established fiscal targets, given their importance for the anchoring of inflation expectations, and hence for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Copom judged that the disinflationary dynamics did not diverge significantly from what was expected but evaluates that the inflation scenario seems more uncertain.",
        "On the one hand, short-term food projections have somewhat slowed down, reverting the recent increases, while industrial prices continue on a benign trajectory.",
        "On the other hand, the recurrence of inflationary surprises on services inflation, particularly on the underlying components and labor-intensive items, raises doubts about the speed of the prospective disinflation.",
        "Copom evaluates that a relevant part of the services disinflation was due to the spillover from disinflations in food and industrial goods and the intensification of the disinflationary process, now in its second stage, will be greatly associated with the labor market and aggregate demand scenario.",
        "The prospective evolution of the output gap and the behavior of the labor market were again considered very relevant in determining the speed with which inflation will reach the target.",
        "A tighter labor market, with wage adjustments above the inflation target and without corresponding productivity gains, could potentially slow down inflation convergence, impacting notably services inflation and more labor-intensive sectors.",
        "Conversely, a favorable recovery of relative prices, a benign commodity dynamics or lower services inflation could potentially contribute to a faster disinflationary process.",
        "In its conclusion, the Committee considers that the prospective inflation scenario has not changed substantially but is more uncertain.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a contractionary and cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Inflation expectations remain unanchored and are a cause for concern.",
        "Copom mentioned that a scenario of expectations above the target for a prolonged period requires a closer monitoring to ensure, even in this scenario, the achievement of the inflation target.",
        "The Committee believes that lowering expectations requires firm action by the monetary authority, as well as continued strengthening of the credibility and reputation of both the institutions and the fiscal and monetary frameworks that make up the Brazilian economic policy.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee judges that the domestic and international environments are more uncertain, requiring caution on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The baseline scenario for inflation and economic activity did not differ substantially from what was projected.",
        "Activity is resilient and labor market, dynamic.",
        "In the labor market, the emphasis was on the acceleration of earnings and the overall income, reinforcing the diagnosis of a dynamic labor market.",
        "Given the difficulty of reaching a firm conclusion on the time lags between the labor market and economic activity, the Committee will continue to monitor data thoroughly.",
        "Regarding inflation, as expected in the second stage of disinflation, the speed of disinflation is slowing down, requiring serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee believes that there is greater uncertainty in the domestic and international contexts.",
        "Internationally, the disinflationary scenario is more uncertain, due to the context of resilient activity in the U.S. and its impact on global financial conditions.",
        "In addition, the impact of monetary policy on activity and inflation also creates uncertainty about the speed of disinflation in several countries.",
        "Regarding domestic inflationary dynamics, while on the one hand we see benign behavior in food and industrial goods, on the other hand, due to resilient activity and the latest releases, there are doubts about the speed of disinflation in services.",
        "The Committee noted that a slower disinflationary process, both domestically and globally, does not constitute the baseline scenario but has been incorporated as a source of uncertainty.",
        "This increased uncertainty recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee recalled that the incorporation of scenarios and exogenous variables, such as fiscal dynamics or the external scenario, takes place through their impact on the prospective dynamics of inflation, with no mechanical relationship with the determination of the interest rate.",
        "After the scenario evaluation, all members agreed that it was appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage points to adjust the degree of prospective monetary tightening.",
        "The Committee then started debating the future signaling of the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "It gave a positive assessment of the use of a conditional signal for subsequent meetings over the last few meetings, reinforcing that it has fulfilled its role of coordinating expectations, increasing the power of monetary policy, and reducing volatility.",
        "It was noted that, so far, the benefits of signaling with an extended horizon have outweighed the costs in both the ex-ante and ex-post assessment.",
        "The debate then turned to communication in a scenario where greater flexibility is required to conduct the appropriate monetary policy to achieve the inflation target.",
        "Copom assessed the convenience of some indication for the June decision, for which it had not yet made any announcement.",
        "The baseline scenario had not changed substantially but given its uncertainties, it was deemed appropriate to have greater monetary policy flexibility.",
        "Even though the communication already contained a built- in conditionality, Copom felt that it did not provide the required flexibility.",
        "In addition, it was argued that a late withdrawal, possibly seen as an unfulfilled promise, should be avoided because it could have an impact on the future credibility of the communication and cause excessive volatility.",
        "After all the arguments, the Committee unanimously concluded that the more uncertain scenario reduced the benefit of future signaling and increased its costs.",
        "This change only reflects a cost-benefit analysis of the use of this additional monetary policy instrument.",
        "Finally, it was emphasized that it would be a mistake to interpret the change in the future signaling as an indication of a change in the monetary policy cycle compatible with the baseline scenario.",
        "The Committee believes that information provided by updating the analyzed data sets will be particularly important in defining the terminal interest rate and its respective path.",
        "Some members also argued that if prospective uncertainty remains high in the future, a slower pace of monetary easing may prove appropriate, for whatever terminal rate is desired.",
        "Finally, the Committee discussed the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle.",
        "The Committee perceives the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "Copom emphasized again that the extension of the cycle over time will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, particularly the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, with only partial reanchoring of inflation expectations and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The committee judges that the baseline scenario has not changed substantially.",
        "The Committee judges that this monetary policy stance is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets in an environment characterized by labor market pressures.",
        "The Committee judges that the environment continues to require caution from emerging market economies.",
        "Regarding the domestic outlook, the recent set of economic activity indicators remains consistent with the economic deceleration scenario expected by the Committee.",
        "Economic growth has moderated, but household consumption has been resilient.",
        "Lastly, the labor market, despite some moderation at the margin, remains strong, with acceleration of real income.",
        "Consumer inflation follows the expected path of disinflation.",
        "The inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy are closer to the inflation target in the most recent releases.",
        "Copom recalls that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate, and that it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment to the domestic inflationary dynamics.",
        "Still on the global environment, after recognizing an improvement in the current inflation situation, the Committee focused on the sources, challenges, and uncertainties for the prospective disinflationary process.",
        "The reversal of supply shocks, the producer inflation under control in China and in the U.S., and the recent commodity price dynamics allow to extrapolate a benign scenario for goods inflation.",
        "However, great uncertainty remains about the prospective global demand and the extent of a potential residual movement in relative prices between goods and services.",
        "More recently, geopolitical tensions and the consequent rise in freight prices have added uncertainty to the prospective scenario.",
        "In addition, the dynamics of economic growth and of the labor market will be important to determine the speed of disinflation in services.",
        "These elements contribute to the debate on the nature of inflationary pressures and, potentially, on the pace of monetary easing to be adopted by advanced economies.",
        "In this context and given the recent volatility and uncertainty ahead on the international outlook, the Committee maintained its assessment that it is appropriate to adopt a cautious stance, especially in emerging countries.",
        "In addition, it will continue to monitor the data from the global economy and their respective transmission channels to the domestic economy.",
        "However, the discussion brought elements that would allow to see a mitigation of the anticipated activity slowdown in the coming months, due to the increase in household income, as a result of the rise in the minimum wage, social benefits, and the more resilient labor market.",
        "It was mentioned that some high- frequency indicators would allow a reading that could corroborate this argument.",
        "All members, however, agreed that the Committee's reference scenario continues to be of a gradual economic growth slowdown, with resilience in household consumption and less dynamism in gross fixed capital formation.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "The Committee noted that the labor market remains dynamic but maintained its assessment that the real income expansion may still reflect temporary issues.",
        "Copom deemed important to continue monitoring the several labor market variables very closely, in particular the dynamics of real income, which has had higher growth in recent months.",
        "The Committee also discussed more thoroughly the relationship between the labor market and prices in the economy.",
        "It highlighted the reciprocal causality between prices and the income dynamics, their respective lags, and the elasticities of impact of one on the other.",
        "Copom will continue to pay attention to the dynamics of income stemming from several surveys to better evaluate the degree of slack in the labor market and its potential impacts on the services inflation.",
        "Despite the restrictive monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the cycle of monetary easing is already being transmitted to the credit market.",
        "There are signs of increased credit granting in some lines and reduction in current interest rates on new operations, also helped by an incipient growing appetite of financial institutions to offer credit in some lines.",
        "On the fiscal front, the Committee reaffirms the importance of firmly pursuing the already established fiscal targets, given their importance for the anchoring of inflation expectations, and hence for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The disinflationary dynamics did not diverge significantly from what the Committee expected, as the benign evolution of the current inflation scenario continues, and some sources that contributed to the first stage of disinflation have been exhausted.",
        "The Committee noted, however, that some aspects of recent inflationary dynamics require further investigation.",
        "It discussed, in particular, the recent dynamics of services inflation, focusing on its underlying components, and the prospective scenarios.",
        "Some members highlighted the importance of understanding the relative contributions to recent disinflation in services of the current monetary tightening and a potential spillover from disinflations in food and industrial goods.",
        "The prospective evolution of the output gap and the behavior of the labor market were again considered very relevant in determining the speed with which inflation will reach the target.",
        "A tighter labor market, with wage adjustments above the inflation target, could potentially slow down inflation convergence, notably impacting inflation in services and more labor- intensive sectors.",
        "Conversely, a favorable recovery of relative prices, a benign commodity dynamics or lower services inflation could potentially contribute to a faster disinflationary process.",
        "In its conclusion, the Committee considers that the prospective inflation scenario has not changed.",
        "Finally, the Committee has already incorporated a rise in prices due to the El Nio phenomenon into its projections and is monitoring the impacts of the phenomenon's reversal.",
        "Inflation expectations remain unanchored and are a cause for concern.",
        "The Committee believes that lowering expectations requires firm action by the monetary authority, as well as continued strengthening of the credibility and reputation of both the institutions and the fiscal and monetary frameworks that make up the Brazilian economic policy.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "In light of the international environment, the Committee judges that the current conjuncture remains uncertain and requires caution on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee believes that there has been a significant disinflationary progress, in line with what the Committee had anticipated, but there is still a long way to go to anchor expectations and return inflation to the target, which requires serenity and moderation on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "In addition, uncertainty, particularly in this volatile international environment, recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee recalled that the incorporation of scenarios and exogenous variables, such as fiscal dynamics or the external scenario, takes place through their impact on the prospective dynamics of inflation, with no mechanical relationship with the determination of the interest rate.",
        "The domestic scenario is moving in line with what was expected.",
        "The conclusion is that the disinflationary path of core and services inflation continues.",
        "In addition, as anticipated by the Committee, recent data suggest a moderation in economic activity.",
        "Finally, inflation projections for the relevant horizon have not changed significantly, standing above the target.",
        "After the scenario evaluation, all members agreed that it was appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point to adjust the degree of prospective monetary tightening.",
        "The Committee analyzed several prospective scenarios, characterized by different trajectories in the domestic and international environments.",
        "Then, it discussed the appropriate strategy and cycle length in each of these scenarios.",
        "It was decided to maintain the recent communication, which already includes the appropriate conditionality in an uncertain environment, specifying the course of action if the expected scenario is confirmed.",
        "Regarding the next steps, the Copom members unanimously anticipated cuts of 0.50 percentage point in the next meetings and judged that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "This pace brings together, on the one hand, the firm commitment with the reanchoring of expectations and the disinflationary dynamics and, on the other hand, the adjustment in the level of monetary tightening in real terms in face of the more benign inflation dynamics, which was anticipated in the reference scenario projections.",
        "The Committee perceives the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "Copom emphasized again that the extension of the cycle over time will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, with only partial reanchoring of inflation expectations and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "If the scenario evolves as expected, the Committee members unanimously anticipate further reductions of the same magnitude in the next meetings, and judge that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "In this scenario of heightened prospective uncertainty, the need for greater caution in the conduct of domestic monetary policy is reinforced.",
        "Regarding the sources of disinflation, the Committee focused to a greater extent on the role of monetary policy in the U.S.",
        "The Committee noted that the current stage of disinflation is more challenging and requires caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "It was observed that market expectations regarding the monetary easing process have shown significant fluctuations, suggesting a broader scenario regarding the next steps in the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy.",
        "Beyond the broader scenario, there has also been a repricing of the cutting cycle in the U.S., with reduction in its extension and a postponement of its beginning.",
        "Copom reinforced that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate and that, as usual, it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment to the domestic inflationary dynamics.",
        "Regarding the speed of disinflation, the Committee discussed the role of the U.S. fiscal policy, which tends to reduce the effects of the ongoing monetary tightening, and the impact on final prices of the wage pressures resulting from the current labor market dynamics.",
        "It was also emphasized that a scenario of increased global uncertainty suggests greater caution in the conduct of domestic monetary policy, due to the possible occurrence of more abrupt movements in the prospective scenario.",
        "Over the last few quarters, economic activity data have surprised with higher growth rates in different components of demand.",
        "May 7-8 activity and the sustainability of consumption over time, in contrast to the scenario of gradual deceleration originally anticipated by the Committee.",
        "Regarding data at the margin, it was debated whether the upward revisions, partly explained by methodological issues related to seasonal adjustments, really reflected stronger activity.",
        "The conclusion was that, despite these mitigating factors, activity has in fact been stronger over the year.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "The Committee has followed closely the recent developments on the fiscal side and their impacts on monetary policy.",
        "The Committee stresses that a credible fiscal policy, committed to debt sustainability, contributes to the anchoring of inflation expectations and to the reduction in the risk premia of financial assets, therefore impacting monetary policy.",
        "Although the projections for the primary balance and the debt trajectory have not changed significantly, there has been an increase in the risk premium and a perception of worsened fiscal situation over the period, according to the respondents to the Pre-Copom Questionnaire.",
        "More importantly, the Committee unanimously believes that the reanchoring of inflation expectations should be pursued, regardless of the sources of the currently observed deanchoring.",
        "Reanchoring inflation expectations is seen as an essential element to ensure the inflation convergence to the target.",
        "The Committee believes that reducing expectations requires a firm action by the monetary authority, as well as continuous strengthening of the credibility and reputation of both the institutions and the fiscal and monetary frameworks that make up the Brazilian economic policy.",
        "The Committee will not shy away from its commitment of reaching the inflation target and understands the fundamental role of expectations in the inflation dynamics.",
        "Copom reinforces that there are recurring surprises pointing to high dynamism in the labor market, which manifests itself in multiple dimensions.",
        "Firstly, expectations for the unemployment rate collected by the Focus Survey, both in the short and medium term, have been falling over the last few quarters.",
        "Moreover, formal jobs creation remains at strong levels and there is still a high proportion of voluntary layoffs.",
        "In addition, the participation rate, and other alternative measures broken down by sector, demography, or region corroborate a tight labor market scenario.",
        "The debate therefore focused on the possible transmission of the tightness in the labor market to wages and prices.",
        "The dynamics of employment and wages were highlighted, recalling the fundamental role of the labor market in determining the output gap and the prospective path of inflation.",
        "On the other hand, it was mentioned that there is no conclusive evidence yet about the labor market impact on inflation.",
        "Finally, the combination of stronger activity and labor market has led to reassessments of the output gap level.",
        "Despite restrictive monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the cycle of monetary easing is already being transmitted to the credit market, in line with what was expected.",
        "Some members emphasized, however, that the recent increase of longer- term rates could result in lower credit market dynamics.",
        "These members highlighted the importance of longer vertices in the yield curve in the determination of credit supply and demand.",
        "After a sequence of upward surprises, inflation core measures slowed down, although remaining above the target.",
        "Some members showed greater concern with food inflation in the short term, while others continued stressing the role of services inflation.",
        "The tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul, in addition to its humanitarian impacts, will also affect the economy.",
        "Copom will continue to monitor the situation.",
        "Copom concluded by assessing that the inflation outlook has become more challenging, with the increase of medium-term inflation projections, even conditioned to a higher interest rate.",
        "Benign surprises were noted in the recent period, but also rising projections for shorter periods, involving market and administered prices.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a more contractionary and more cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee judges that the domestic and international environments should remain more uncertain, requiring greater caution on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Some members noted merit in the debate about an asymmetrical balance of risks tilted to the upside.",
        "These members deemed that, besides the persistent and high uncertainty of domestic and international outlooks, the weight of upside factors, at this moment, is higher than that from downside factors, therefore judging that the balance of risks is asymmetric.",
        "For those members, the resilience of activity and the strength of the labor market suggest lower elasticity of the output gap to the monetary policy, which could lead to an even slower disinflation process.",
        "The debate began with the analysis of the objective dimensions that guide the decisions in the inflation-targeting regime.",
        "Firstly, despite an upward interest trajectory collected by the Focus survey, used in the reference scenario, projected inflation increased for the relevant monetary policy horizon.",
        "Also, the labor market and activity scenarios have shown dynamism greater than expected by Copom.",
        "Finally, the external scenario was deemed more adverse, requiring greater caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "After the scenario analysis, most Copom members assessed that it was appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "For this, they evaluated that the expected scenario has not materialized due to the additional deanchoring of expectations, increased inflation projections, the more adverse external scenario, and greater-than-expected economic activity dynamics.",
        "They stressed that much more important than the possible reputational cost of not following some guidance, even if conditional, is the risk of loss of credibility about the commitment to fighting inflation and anchoring expectations.",
        "In view of the analysis, these members considered that a reduction of 0.25 percentage points was more appropriate to achieve the inflation target in the relevant horizon.",
        "May 7-8 The members who voted for a reduction of 0.50 percentage points in the Selic rate also shared the perception of increased internal and external uncertainties between the meetings of March and May, which have already been discussed here.",
        "They also share the firm commitment to the fundamental goal of achieving the target and reanchoring expectations.",
        "The debate proposed by these members focused on the opportunity cost of not following the guidance vis-a-vis the change in the scenario in the period.",
        "As in the debates that occurred in other meetings, such members discussed whether the prospective scenario diverged significantly from what was expected to the point of being worth the reputational cost of not following the guidance, which could lead to a reduction in the power of the Committee's formal communications.",
        "For these members, it was deemed appropriate, as in previous meetings, to follow the guidance, but reaffirming the firm commitment to the target and the required terminal interest rate to achieve the Committees primary objective of inflation convergence to the target.",
        "They emphasized that extracting the underlying trend from the inflation dynamics in an uncertain environment is difficult, but it should by no means be confused with leniency towards the indicators released in the period, particularly inflation expectations.",
        "Strengthening the analysis, they noted that inflation projections were more affected by the determination of the terminal interest rate and that the reduction of 0.50 percentage points would keep monetary policy sufficiently contractionary.",
        "Finally, this group also emphasized the need for flexibility in the decisions as of June, which would allow, in view of the new set of information, to adequately calibrate the path of the monetary policy instrument.",
        "All members agreed that the adoption of a tighter and more cautious monetary policy and with no indications about future movements was more appropriate in view of the uncertain global scenario and the domestic scenario marked by activity resilience and unanchored expectations.",
        "The Committee also stressed that monetary policy must remain contractionary and that the terminal interest rate will be the one that consolidates not only the disinflation process but also the anchoring of inflation expectations around the targets.",
        "Finally, all members corroborated the understanding that the extension and adequacy of future interest rate changes will be determined by the firm commitment of achieving the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, deanchored inflation expectations, and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee unanimously judges that the uncertain global scenario and the domestic scenario, marked by resilient economic activity and deanchored expectations, require greater caution.",
        "The Committee also stresses that monetary policy should continue being contractionary until the consolidation of both the disinflation process and the anchoring of expectations around the targets.",
        "The Committee also reinforces, with special emphasis, that the extension and adequacy of future changes in the interest rate will be determined by the firm commitment of reaching the inflation target in the relevant horizon.",

        "In emerging countries, however, there is greater caution due to a more challenging scenario, with the cautious continuation of interest rate cutting cycle in some countries and its interruption in others.",
        "In some emerging economies, there has been a reduction in the previously strong correlation between long-term local yield curves tenors and the U.S. Treasuries rates.",
        "In the current environment of lower liquidity, there is potentially greater differentiation among assets, relatively increasing the demand for safer assets or with better fundamentals.",
        "Copom reinforced that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate and that, as usual, it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment to the domestic inflationary dynamics.",
        "It was also emphasized that a scenario of increased global uncertainty suggests greater caution in the conduct of domestic monetary policy, given the possibility of more abrupt movements in the prospective scenario.",
        "It was highlighted the resilience of domestic activity and the sustenance of consumption over time, in contrast to the scenario of gradual deceleration originally anticipated by the Committee.",
        "Regarding data at the margin, on the one hand, there were new upward surprises in activity.",
        "In turn, there is great uncertainty about the economic effects of the tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul.",
        "Uncertainties remain about the intensity of activity decline and its subsequent recovery, as well as the decrease in the stock of capital caused by the floods.",
        "Overall, the Committee assessed that the updated activity projections are in fact stronger for the year.",
        "Copom reassessed the occurrence of recurring surprises pointing to high labor market dynamics, corroborating a tight labor market scenario.",
        "The Committee believes that the output gap which was slightly negative in the previous released assessment, but which had already been subject of analysis through different methods over the last months is now around neutrality.",
        "The Committee discussed the neutral interest rate estimates that would be used as an assumption for the projections to be analyzed.",
        "The neutral rate is an unobservable variable, subject to highly uncertainty in the estimation.",
        "There is a domestic and a global debate about the current dynamics of the neutral interest rate.",
        "In short-term changes, the emphasis is usually on productivity movements or fiscal figures, which impact domestic savings.",
        "For long-term changes, issues related to demography, productivity, and the global savings rate stand out.",
        "Due to the intrinsic uncertainty and the very nature of this variable, the Committee reinforced that the neutral rate is not a variable to be updated at a high frequency and that it is not expected to register abrupt movements either, except in exceptional cases.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "The Committee closely monitors how the recent developments on the fiscal side impact monetary policy and financial assets.",
        "The Committee stresses that a credible fiscal policy, committed to debt sustainability, contributes to the anchoring of inflation expectations and to the reduction in the risk premia of financial assets, therefore impacting monetary policy.",
        "Synchronous and countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies help ensure price stability and, without prejudice to its fundamental objective, smooth out fluctuations in the economic activity level and foster full employment.",
        "The Committee unanimously believes that the reanchoring of inflation expectations should be pursued, regardless of the sources behind the currently observed deanchoring, and emphasizes that the reanchoring of inflation expectations is seen as an essential element to ensure inflation convergence to the target.",
        "The Committee believes that reducing expectations requires a firm action by the monetary authority, as well as continuous strengthening of the credibility and reputation of both the institutions and the fiscal and monetary frameworks that make up the Brazilian economic policy.",
        "The Committee will not shy away from its commitment of reaching the inflation target and understands the fundamental role of expectations in the inflation dynamics.",
        "Despite restrictive monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the cycle of monetary easing is already being transmitted to the credit market, in line with what was expected.",
        "Some members emphasized, however, that the recent increase of longer-term rates could result in lower credit market dynamics.",
        "These members highlighted the importance of longer vertices in the yield curve in the determination of credit supply and demand.",
        "The Committee assessed that inflation data suggested a path that did not diverge significantly from what was expected.",
        "Some members were more concerned about food inflation in the short term, highlighting not only the effect of the floods in the Rio Grande do Sul but also revisions to food prices in other regions.",
        "Services inflation continued to be a subject of much scrutiny, being analyzed through its different dimensions, lags, and prospects.",
        "Part of the debate focused on the more recent inflation path, in which industrial goods and food-at-home inflation no longer contribute to disinflation at this stage of the disinflationary process.",
        "At the same time, services inflation, which has greater inertia, plays a major role in the disinflationary dynamics at the current stage.",
        "Copom concluded by assessing that the inflation outlook has become more challenging, with the increase of medium-term inflation projections, even conditioned on a higher interest rate.",
        "Benign surprises were noted in the recent period, but also the rise in projections for shorter periods, involving market prices.",
        "In the end, Copom unanimously concluded that a more contractionary and more cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee judges that the domestic and international environments remain more uncertain, requiring greater caution on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The balance of risks was again under discussion.",
        "On the one hand, it was emphasized that the reassessment of the output gap had already incorporated into the central scenario part of the upside asymmetry related to activity.",
        "On the other, there was a concern that the output gap remains resilient, and that food inflation is more persistent at the recently observed levels.",
        "As far as the domestic outlook is concerned, the labor market and the economic activity, in particular household consumption, have been surprising, diverging from the expected slowdown scenario.",
        "Moreover, inflation projections for 2024 and 2025 have risen again, despite the increase in the conditioning Selic rate extracted from the Focus survey.",
        "Moreover, the external outlook remains adverse, reflecting the market agents' view that interest rates in developed countries will remain high for a longer period.",
        "Thus, the Committee considered that monetary policy should continue being contractionary for sufficient time at a level that consolidates both the disinflation process and the anchoring of expectations around the targets.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, further deanchoring of inflation expectations, and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",

        "Indicators aggregating the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which have greater inflationary inertia, were lower but remained above the target.",
        "After the first disinflation stage following the normalization of productive chains, the early effects of the monetary policy tightening, and the reduction of pressures on commodities, Copom is focused on the disinflation sources for the next quarters.",
        "Amid an uncertain geopolitical context, with a strong labor market and tightened output gap in advanced economies, Copom believes that the prolonged monetary policy tightening strategy has been essential to control global inflation, facilitating inflation control in emerging markets.",
        "Conversely, the global monetary tightening can put pressure on the exchange rate and impact the prices of domestic assets, contributing to a slower disinflation process in the short term.",
        "Risks around the global scenario have increased.",
        "The rise of long-term interest rates in the US tightens financial conditions but it is still uncertain the lag and magnitude of this impact on the US economic activity, which remains resilient.",
        "In face of the increased long-term interest rates, the Committee discussed, at first, the possible reasons for this phenomenon.",
        "In its discussion, Copom mostly emphasized the fiscal prospects, particularly in the US, highlighting their impacts on global financial conditions.",
        "For some members, the current outlook is highly uncertain, and the combination of a substantial tightening of financial conditions with the activity resilience can make it more difficult to achieve a soft landing.",
        "Copom debated the multiple transmission channels of US interest rates to the Brazilian economy, discussing the effects via interest rate, forward premium in the interest rate curve, external demand, exchange rate, neutral interest rate, commodity prices, among others.",
        "Firstly, the Committee emphasized the impact of the need to attract resources to finance higher debt in developed countries.",
        "Other markets such as the emerging sovereign debt and private credit markets have been affected in this environment of higher sovereign debt interest rates in central economies.",
        "The final impact on those markets will be greater the longer the higher interest rates last, which could lead to reallocations in the debt rollover process.",
        "Another channel, with direct effect on inflation, is via exchange rate.",
        "In this discussion, Copom highlighted that, despite the severity of such events as the conflict in the Middle East and the substantial movement in the prices of international assets, the exchange rate and the oil price have had moderate changes so far.",
        "Finally, when incorporating the multiple transmission channels into a more uncertain environment, Copom evaluates as appropriate to adopt a more cautious stance in face of the risks involved.",
        "Regarding the domestic economic activity, the Committee continues to anticipate an economic activity deceleration during the second half of the year, after growth surprises in the first half.",
        "In line with this understanding, data released in the more recent period suggest loss of dynamics in the services sector following a higher-than- expected expansion in the first half of the year.",
        "Copom noticed that, for the industry, the scenario remains stable, with the most credit-sensitive sectors registering stronger deceleration.",
        "In addition, inventories also increased in several sectors.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "In its analysis of the labor market, the Committee first discussed the developments in the employment level.",
        "The unemployment rate continues to decline, although recent data also reflect a fall in the participation rate.",
        "Data relative to formal job hirings remain at high levels, consistent with a very dynamic labor market.",
        "Part of the discussion was then focused on the workers earnings and income, which suggest some acceleration in real gains in the more recent period.",
        "The Committee considered that this development can reflect temporary issues and continues evaluating that there is no evidence of high wage pressures in labor negotiations, although judged as important to keep monitoring very carefully the several labor market variables.",
        "The recent reduction in the 12-month inflation makes it difficult to analyze real gains in an environment of wage rigidity, leading to different conclusions by different surveys and analysis about the change in real wages at the margin.",
        "Copom will continue to pay attention to the dynamics of earnings coming from several surveys to better evaluate the degree of slack in the labor market and its potential impacts on the services inflation.",
        "The deceleration in credit granting is in line with the monetary policy stance.",
        "A stronger deceleration is seen in corporate credit granting, coupled with a recomposition involving relatively less credit granted via banking sector and more via capital markets.",
        "A marked heterogeneity between the productive sectors remains both in the interest rates and in the volumes of granting credit.",
        "Household credit, in turn, shows lower deceleration and a recovery favoring low-cost modalities.",
        "The Committee had been assessing that the fiscal uncertainty was limited to the execution of targets already presented but noted that, in the more recent period, uncertainty increased about the target itself for the fiscal balance, which led to an increased risk premium.",
        "Given the importance of the execution of the fiscal targets already established for the anchoring of inflation expectations, and hence for the conduct of monetary policy, the Committee reaffirms the importance of firmly pursuing those targets.",
        "Copom judged that the benign evolution of the current inflation continues as already expected.",
        "As anticipated, some sources of disinflation that contributed to the first disinflation stage are no longer present.",
        "In particular, a lower downside pressure is observed in the wholesale prices of industrial goods, which, until recently, were still normalizing with the end of the bottlenecks in productive chains.",
        "Similarly, prices of international agricultural commodities and domestic food prices, which also contributed to disinflation throughout 2023, no longer suggest downside pressures with the same intensity in the next quarters.",
        "Furthermore, the components related to industrial goods and administered prices might present a less benign behavior than previously expected, due to the recent movement of the exchange rate and the prices of international commodities.",
        "Copom still assesses that the inherent volatility of food and industrial goods components suggests the possibility of abrupt reversals, recommending caution.",
        "For the prospective scenario, Copom discussed more thoroughly the determinants of services inflation.",
        "The risks related to the El Nio weather phenomenon partially incorporated into the reference scenario were also mentioned, as well as those related to international oil price developments.",
        "Copom highlighted the uncertainty surrounding _El Nio in terms of its magnitude, the period in which the phenomenon_ would have the greatest impact, and the particular impacts on different food products.",
        "Copom opted to incorporate a relatively small impact of the _El Nio into its food_ inflation projections, but some members stressed the inflationary impacts in the event of a more extreme phenomenon.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a contractionary and cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Inflation expectations remain unanchored and are a cause for concern.",
        "The Committee believes that lowering expectations requires firm action by the monetary authority, as well as continued strengthening of the credibility and reputation of both the institutions and the fiscal and monetary frameworks that make up the Brazilian economic policy.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "In light of the international environment, the Committee judges that the current conjuncture is more uncertain than usual and requires caution on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee believes that there has been significant disinflationary progress, in line with what the Committee had anticipated, but there is still a long way to go to anchor expectations and return inflation to the target, which requires serenity and moderation on the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The domestic scenario is moving in line with what was expected.",
        "The conclusion is that the disinflationary path of core and services inflation continues, reinforcing the recent benign dynamics of inflation.",
        "Moreover, recent data suggest a certain moderation in economic activity, as anticipated by the Committee, particularly in services and trade.",
        "Finally, inflation projections for the relevant horizon have risen somewhat and are above the target.",
        "The reasons for the increase include changes in administered prices projected for 2024 and the trajectories of economic activity, economic slack, and labor market, which suggest a tighter output gap, with an impact on market prices inflation.",

        "The Committee is unanimous in its assessment that the increased uncertainty in the global scenario calls for caution.",
        "After the scenario evaluation, all members agreed that it was appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point to adjust the degree of prospective monetary tightening.",
        "The Committee analyzed several prospective scenarios, characterized by different trajectories in the domestic and international environments.",
        "Then, it discussed the appropriate strategy and cycle length in each of these scenarios.",
        "It was decided to maintain the recent communication, which already includes the appropriate conditionality in an uncertain environment, specifying the course of action if the expected scenario is confirmed.",
        "Regarding the next steps, Copom members unanimously anticipated cuts of 0.50 percentage point in the next meetings and judged that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "This pace brings together, on the one hand, the firm commitment with the reanchoring of expectations and the disinflationary dynamics and, on the other hand, the adjustment in the level of monetary tightening in real terms in face of the more benign inflation dynamics, which was anticipated in the reference scenario projections.",
        "Finally, the Committee debated the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle in an uncertain global outlook.",
        "The Committee assesses the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "Copom emphasized again that the extension of the cycle over time will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, with only partial reanchoring of inflation expectations and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "If the scenario evolves as expected, the Committee members unanimously anticipate further reductions of the same magnitude in the next meetings, and judge that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets in an environment characterized by labor market pressures.",
        "The Committee judges that the environment continues to require caution from emerging market economies.",
        "Regarding the domestic outlook, the recent set of economic activity indicators remains consistent with the economic deceleration scenario expected by the Committee.",
        "The release of the third-quarter GDP figures confirmed the anticipated moderation in growth, but with resilience in household consumption.",
        "The labor market remains strong but with some moderation at the margin.",
        "Consumer inflation follows the expected path of disinflation and its benign composition stands out.",
        "The inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy came closer to the inflation target in the most recent releases.",
        "The most recent data, although still incipient, suggest moderate growth and slowdown of inflationary pressures in some countries, especially in the groups of industrial goods and energy commodities.",
        "As a result, for several Copom members, the probability of a soft landing in the United States has increased.",
        "This environment has allowed some countries to signal a shift in monetary policy, while other countries have maintained their strategy of prolonged monetary policy tightening, which has been essential to contain global inflation.",
        "The Committee again focused on the sources and uncertainties for the future disinflationary process, contrasting the improvement in the current inflationary outlook with the challenges still ahead, such as the uncertain geopolitical context, the heated labor markets, and the tight output gap in several advanced economies.",
        "Given the recent volatility and uncertainty ahead on the international outlook, Copom maintained its assessment that it is appropriate to adopt a cautious stance, especially in emerging countries.",
        "In addition, it will continue to monitor the data from the global economy and their respective transmission channels to the domestic economy.",
        "The resilience of household consumption which surprised positively again may be related to an increase in gross household income, due to the expansion of the labor market, social benefits, and income gains related to disinflation in important segments of the consumers basket.",
        "In turn, gross fixed capital formation which is more sensitive to financial conditions and future prospects and uncertainties continues to fall, after a sharp rise during the pandemic period.",
        "Some members judged that the persistence of a combination of greater resilience in consumption and reduction of investment could lead to demand exceeding supply in the medium term, with potential impacts on prices.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms and fiscal discipline, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "In the Copom's analysis of the labor market, formal job hiring remains at high levels and compatible with a very dynamic labor market.",
        "Although real income gains increased in the most recent period, the Committee maintained its assessment that this development may reflect temporary issues and that there is no evidence of high wage pressures in labor negotiations.",
        "The Committee deemed important to continue monitoring the several labor market variables very closely, in particular the dynamics of real income.",
        "Copom will continue to pay attention to the dynamics of earnings coming from several surveys to better evaluate the degree of slack in the labor market and its potential impacts on the services inflation.",
        "Corporate credit granting registered a higher deceleration, coupled with a recomposition that involves relatively less credit from the banking sector and more from the capital markets.",
        "Despite the tight monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that a transmission of the monetary policy cycle expected by the market to the current rates of new credit grants is already taking place, leading, in particular, to greater dynamism in the capital market in the recent period.",
        "On the fiscal front, the Committee reaffirms the importance of firmly pursuing the already established fiscal targets, given their importance for the anchoring of inflation expectations, and hence for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The disinflationary dynamics did not diverge significantly from what the Committee expected, as the benign evolution of the current inflation scenario continues, and some sources that contributed to the first stage of disinflation have been exhausted.",
        "The underlying services component showed some downward surprises, which prompted a discussion about the reasons for this result, which include, among others, the normalization of relative prices, the inertial impact of headline inflation, the benign behavior of wages, the stronger movement of primary shocks in commodity and food, and the lagged impacts of monetary policy.",
        "The prospective evolution of the output gap and the behavior of the labor market were considered very relevant in determining the speed with which inflation will reach the target.",
        "Based on more evidence, the Committee slightly raised the inflationary impact of the El Nio weather phenomenon on food inflation.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a contractionary and cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",

        "In addition, uncertainty, particularly in this volatile international environment, recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee recalled that the incorporation of scenarios and exogenous variables, such as fiscal dynamics or the external scenario, takes place through their impact on the prospective dynamics of inflation, with no mechanical relationship with the determination of the interest rate.",
        "The domestic scenario is moving in line with what was expected.",
        "The conclusion is that the disinflationary path of core and services inflation continues, reinforcing the benign dynamics of recent inflation.",
        "In addition, as anticipated by the Committee, recent data suggest a moderation in economic activity.",
        "Finally, inflation projections for the relevant horizon have not changed significantly, standing above the target.",

        "The Committee analyzed various prospective scenarios, characterized by different trajectories in the domestic and international environments.",
        "Then, it discussed the appropriate strategy and cycle length in each of these scenarios.",
        "It was decided to maintain the recent communication, which already includes the appropriate conditionality in an uncertain environment, specifying the course of action if the expected scenario is confirmed.",
        "Regarding the next steps, Copom members unanimously anticipated cuts of 0.50 percentage point in the next meetings and judged that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "On the one hand, this pace brings together the firm commitment with the reanchoring of expectations and the disinflationary dynamics and, on the other hand, the adjustment in the level of monetary tightening in real terms in face of the more benign dynamics of the anticipated inflation in the reference scenario projections.",
        "Finally, the Committee discussed the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle.",
        "The Committee assesses the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower, with only partial reanchoring of inflation expectations and a challenging global outlook, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "If the scenario evolves as expected, the Committee members unanimously anticipate further reductions of the same magnitude in the next meetings, and judge that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "There is a normalization in supply chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, leading to a moderation in goods-related inflationary pressures.",
        "Conversely, the low degree of labor market slack in some economies, associated with a high current inflation and a high degree of inflation diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the services sector should last longer.",
        "The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues towards restrictive rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial conditions and impacting economic growth expectations.",
        "It was observed that confidence indicators dropped and industrial production, trade, and services indicators downturned.",
        "The labor market, which surprised positively throughout 2022, still shows signs of deceleration, with a decline in net hirings in New CAGED and some stability in the unemployment rate stemming from setbacks in the employed population and the workforce.",
        "Notwithstanding the slowdown at the margin, consumer inflation remains high.",
        "The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.",
        "The Committee analyzed an alternative scenario with stable interest rates throughout the entire relevant horizon.",
        "The Committee evaluated different assumptions, parameters, and scenarios in its discussion of inflation projections.",
        "On this subject, some members evaluated the possibility of incorporating some increase in the neutral interest rate, towards the movement observed in longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey.",
        "Some members emphasized that economic activity and labor market data remain relatively resilient in the US.",
        "In China, the adjustments in sanitary restrictions should lead to a cyclical recovery in demand and a reduction in the risks of supply disruptions.",
        "However, the Committee assesses that the Chinese long-term growth is expected to remain lower than observed in the pre-pandemic period, reflecting both the adjustments in the real estate sector and the worsened demographics expected in the coming years.",
        "In Europe, the milder winter has also reduced the likelihood of extreme scenarios in energy supply.",
        "In the US, economic activity data have been pointing to deceleration, but still in an environment of very pressured labor market.",
        "Despite these short-term developments, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of tightening of financial conditions for a longer period, with rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration.",
        "The Committee continues to assess that the process of global disinflation, especially regarding core inflation indicators, is challenging and will possibly happen more slowly than usually observed, since inflation is widespread in the services segment.",
        "However, some members highlighted the deceleration in the measures of core inflation in several countries.",
        "Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of marginal growth and employment data suggest a loss of dynamism.",
        "Some members observed a movement towards partial recomposition of recent real wages losses, but judge that this movement is expected and is coupled with a deceleration in nominal gains that is expected to intensify ahead.",
        "The Committee will continue to monitor the labor market releases, continuously assessing the role of lagged inflation and labor market pressures on wage adjustments.",
        "The set of released data, including the drop in confidence indicators and the deceleration in credit grants, together with the lagged effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's expectation of a slowdown in the pace of economic activity, which should worsen over the coming quarters.",
        "The Committee noted with particular concern the deterioration in longer-term inflation expectations.",
        "In the first case, the BCB reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the established targets and assesses that, once the deanchoring is observed, it is necessary to remain even more vigilant in the conduct of monetary policy to reanchor expectations and thus reduce the future cost of the disinflation.",
        "Jan. 31 - Feb. 1 mitigate any inflationary effects of the fiscal policy.",
        "Finally, regarding the third case, the BCB conducts monetary policy based on the targets set by the CMN.",
        "In summary, more important than analyzing the motivations for the rise in expectations, the Committee emphasizes that it will act to ensure that inflation converges to the targets.",
        "The Committee also discussed the impacts of the fiscal scenario on inflation.",
        "In this discussion, it was again emphasized that the net effect of the conduct of fiscal policy on inflation is very dependent on the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions.",
        "Thus, by analyzing the multiple channels, including the movement in financial conditions arising from future interest rates, and updating the assumptions for the fiscal path to incorporate the sanctioned budget for 2023, the Committee assesses that the scenario for activity has not changed significantly.",
        "Copom sustained its usual governance of incorporating the policies already sanctioned by law, but it acknowledges that the implementation of the proposed fiscal package could reduce the upside inflation risk.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee judges that this scenario raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the CMN.",
        "In this scenario, Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets.",
        "The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its projections but anticipates that, for the next quarter, it will resume adopting the usual horizon, according to the calendar years, since the six-quarter ahead horizon will coincide with the calendar year of 2024, and then there will be no direct effect of the tax changes in the usual horizon.",
        "The Committee began its debate by evaluating whether the previously outlined strategy of stable interest rates would be sufficient for the convergence of inflation to its targets.",
        "For this purpose, Copom analyzed the main determinants of the inflation trajectory and how they behaved more recently.",
        "Starting with the output gap, a deceleration in economic activity, credit, and more recently in the labor market was observed, as expected by the Committee given the monetary policy lags.",
        "Jan. 31 - Feb. 1 should continue, and it is necessary for the monetary policy channels to act and for inflation to converge to its targets.",
        "It was also noted that economic growth prospects have not changed significantly in the recent period.",
        "Services inflation has moderated but remains at a level not compatible with the target.",
        "The Committee focuses on services inflation since it responds to inflationary inertia and economic activity more directly, and both factors are expected to put less inflationary pressures over the horizon.",
        "In any case, this dimension continues to call for attention, and the Committee continues to evaluate the speed with which the convergence process will take place.",
        "In the balance of risks, global inflationary pressures have eased, but there is still high uncertainty about the deceleration of the inflation process, which tends to be non- linear.",
        "The risks are likely to persist as long as a tight labor market is observed in several advanced economies.",
        "Concerning domestic risks, two sets of risks intersect on fiscal issues.",
        "Firstly, the fiscal framework revision reduces the visibility on public accounts for the coming years, introduces premia on asset prices, and impacts inflation expectations.",
        "Secondly, concerning fiscal stimuli, Copom will continue to monitor their impact on economic activity and inflation and reinforces that, in an environment of a narrowed output gap, the impact on inflation tends to outweigh the desired impact on activity.",
        "Some members noted that the implementation of the Ministry of Finance fiscal package should mitigate the fiscal risk and consider that it will be important to monitor the challenges for its implementation.",
        "Finally, the risk of a tighter-than-evaluated output gap persists, and the Committee will continue to assess data and models for a more thorough understanding.",
        "Regarding downside inflation risks, international commodity prices in local currency have reduced, but the Committee assesses that the risk of a sharper slowdown in global economic activity remains on the horizon, despite this risk is to some degree reduced by China's reopening process.",
        "In this regard, the Committee will continue to monitor, on the one hand, the process of withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus in advanced economies and, on the other hand, the Chinese reopening process.",
        "Regarding inflation expectations, the Committee notes with concern the recent movement at longer horizons.",
        "In addition to the direct impact of the rise in expectations on inflation projections, the rise in long-term expectations raises the cost of the disinflation by requiring greater participation of other monetary policy channels and, consequently, a wider output gap to obtain the same fall in inflation.",
        "The Committee will remain vigilant and will persist until the anchoring of expectations is consolidated.",
        "Copoms projections have risen due to the increase in both administered and market prices.",
        "Among the preponderant factors for increased projections, the rise in Focus survey inflation expectations stands out.",
        "Projections conditioned by the assumptions of the reference scenario do not show convergence to the target over the relevant monetary policy horizon, but the introduction of a more extended monetary tightening, as in its alternative scenario, generates a relevant impact on the projections toward convergence to the targets.",
        "Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the cumulative impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken.",
        "The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a larger degree, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment.",
        "The Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "The Copom members analyzed the recent performance and prospects for the Brazilian and international economies, under the monetary policy framework, whose objective is to comply with the inflation targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In case of inconsistency, the Portuguese version prevails.",
        "The episodes involving banks in the United States and Europe have increased the uncertainty and the volatility in markets and require monitoring.",
        "Major economies have emphasized the principle of separation of objectives and instruments in the conduct of monetary and macroprudential policies.",
        "At the same time, recent data on global activity and inflation remain resilient and the process of monetary policy tightening in major economies continues to advance.",
        "The external environment continues to be marked by the prospect of global growth below potential, but the easing of the Covid policy in China, a milder winter in Europe and the possibility of a gradual US growth slowdown soften the ongoing global economic slowdown resulting from the tightening of financial conditions in the major economies.",
        "Conversely, the impact on financial conditions and consequently on global growth of the recent episodes involving the banking system in major economies is still uncertain but has a negative bias.",
        "Recent inflation readings point to some stabilization of core inflation in several countries at levels above their targets and reinforce the inertial nature of the current inflationary process.",
        "The inflationary environment remains challenging and the low degree of labor market slack in some economies, coupled with persistently high current inflation with a high degree of diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures, particularly in the services sector, should last longer.",
        "The process of normalization of monetary policy continues towards contractionary rates synchronized across countries.",
        "In several emerging economies, tightening cycles come to a halt or suggest they are nearing an end.",
        "In any case, most monetary authorities signal a prolonged period of high interest rates is necessary to fight inflationary pressures, which calls for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging countries.",
        "A moderation is observed in the coincident indicators of activity and the credit market has also shown deceleration at the margin.",
        "The labor market, which surprised positively throughout 2022, continues to show signs of moderation, with relative stability in the unemployment rate, stemming from declines in the employed population and in the workforce.",
        "The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.",
        "The Committee analyzed an alternative scenario with stable interest rates over the entire relevant horizon.",
        "The real neutral interest rate is the rate in which, in the absence of impact from other factors, the inflation rate remains stable, and the output grows according to its potential, reflecting productivity gains and changes in the structural fundamentals of the economy.",
        "The Committee continues to assess that the global disinflation process, especially regarding underlying inflation indicators, is challenging and may be slower than what is usually observed, as inflation is widespread in the services segment.",
        "In this context, the reduction of inflationary pressures continues to require the commitment and determination of central banks with the control of inflation through a more prolonged tightening of financial conditions.",
        "Such determination, with a likely impact upon asset prices in the short term, contributes to a more credible and lasting global disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee will continue to closely monitor this situation, analyzing possible contagion channels, but assesses that the direct impact on the domestic financial system and other emerging countries is, so far, limited, with no changes in the stability or efficiency of those financial systems.",
        "The scenario, therefore, looks even more challenging for the conduct of monetary policy, with increased risks both around the inflationary scenario and in relation to financial stability.",
        "On the one hand, there are the episodes involving the banking sector and the consequent need to provide liquidity.",
        "On the other hand, global growth and inflation data remain resilient, requiring commitment and determination from the monetary authorities.",
        "The Committee believes that the best contribution of monetary policy continues to be in combating inflationary pressures and smoothing out economic fluctuations.",
        "In addition, some members emphasized that they do not see a dilemma in the conduct of monetary policy between its objective of inflation control and the objective of financial stability.",
        "The Committee stressed how the two objectives have specific instruments.",
        "Brazilian activity data continue to indicate a more moderate pace of growth at the margin, and employment data suggest moderation.",
        "It was pointed out that after a period of strong recovery in the last two years, a process of deceleration of growth has begun in the durable goods sector, which had been particularly buoyant in the pandemic, and which is more sensitive to interest rate policy.",
        "The deceleration spread to the non-durable goods sector and, subsequently, to the services sector, although in a milder way.",
        "Copom continues to evaluate that the economic slowdown underway is necessary to guarantee the convergence of inflation to its targets, particularly after a prolonged period of inflation above the target.",
        "As expected, given the greater lag in relation to the economic cycle, only recently has the labor market shown evidence of a moderate slowdown, compatible with the Committee's expectation of a moderation in the pace of economic activity.",
        "Some members have observed that there is a movement towards a partial recomposition of recent losses in real wages.",
        "This movement is expected and has been accompanied by a deceleration in nominal gains, which is expected to intensify ahead.",
        "The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics continues to be characterized by a process with two distinct stages.",
        "In the first stage, already completed, there is a greater speed of disinflation, with a greater effect on administered prices and an indirect effect on market prices through less inertia.",
        "In the second stage, which is currently observed, the speed of disinflation is slower and core inflation which is more affected by the aggregate demand and the interest rate policy is reduced at a slower pace, responding to the output gap and inflation expectations.",
        "It is thus observed an inflationary dynamic driven by excess demand initially in goods, and which has currently shifted to the services sector, and which therefore requires moderation of economic activity for monetary policy channels to act.",
        "Such a process demands serenity and patience in the conduct of monetary policy for the convergence of inflation to its targets.",
        "The further deterioration of inflation expectations in the Focus survey, especially at longer maturities, was much debated.",
        "It has been pointed out that the behavior of expectations is a fundamental aspect of the inflationary process since it affects the setting of present and future prices and wages.",
        "As higher inflation is projected ahead, companies and workers start to incorporate such future inflation in the adjustments of prices and wages.",
        "Thus, there is a greater rise in prices in the current period, and the inflationary process is fed by these expectations.",
        "It was also highlighted that the anchoring of expectations is a key factor for price stability.",
        "Therefore, and following the best international practice, the Committee incorporates expectations in its decision- making process, analyzing and including them as one of the factors affecting its inflation projections.",
        "Additional tightening of credit conditions was observed in some modalities.",
        "Some members believe that this movement is in line with what is expected, considering the interest rates rise undertaken until the middle of the second half of For these members, an increase in delinquency and a slowdown in credit granting should still be expected, but in line with what was observed in previous monetary policy tightening cycles.",
        "Other members, in contrast, assess that in the most recent period the tightening of credit granting was more intense than expected, but focused on some specific markets.",
        "The Committee believes that the BCB has the appropriate and necessary liquidity instruments linked to macroprudential policy to address localized relevant frictions in the system, should they occur.",
        "Furthermore, it reinforced that monetary policy is more appropriate to act in a counter-cyclical manner on the aggregate demand.",
        "The Committee also discussed the impacts of the fiscal scenario on inflation.",
        "In this regard, the Copom emphasized again that the net effect of the fiscal policy conduct on inflation is highly dependent on the current macroeconomic and financial conditions.",
        "Copom evaluated that the Ministry of Finance's commitment to the implementation of the fiscal package, which is already identified in fiscal statistics and the reinstatement of fuel taxes, smooths the fiscal stimuli on demand, reducing the upside risk on inflation in the short-term.",
        "Furthermore, the Committee will continue monitoring the elaboration, discussion, and implementation of the fiscal framework that will be presented by the Government and voted by the National Congress.",
        "Copom emphasized that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the presentation of the fiscal framework, since the former remains conditional on the reaction of inflation expectations, the public debt projections, and the asset prices.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "On the one hand, the recent reinstatement of fuel taxes has reduced the uncertainty of the fiscal results in the short term.",
        "On the other hand, the current scenario, marked by high volatility in financial markets and deanchored long-term inflation expectations from the targets, requires further attention when conducting monetary policy.",
        "The Committee judges that the deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In this scenario, Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets.",
        "The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon in its projections but anticipates that for the next quarter the Committee will again use the usual calendar-year horizon, since the six-quarter horizon ahead will coincide with the 2024 calendar year, so there will be no more direct effect from the tax changes on the usual horizon.",
        "Copom started the debate by evaluating whether the previously outlined strategy of stable interest rates would be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation towards to its targets.",
        "To this end, the Committee has continued its process of analyzing the main determinants of the inflation path and how they have behaved in the most recent period.",
        "No significant change occurred in the prospective scenario for the output gap, but a deeper debate took place about the effects of a possible greater-than- projected credit tightening on economic activity.",
        "As for services inflation and inflation cores, increased resilience and lower speed are observed in the recent releases, in line with the non-linear process already anticipated by Copom.",
        "In addition, inflation expectations followed a deanchoring process, partially related to the questioning about a likely change in future inflation targets.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the credibility of pursued targets is a fundamental component of the inflation targeting regime and contributes to the proper functioning of the expectations channel, making the disinflation quicker and less costly.",
        "In this regard, decisions that induce a reanchoring of expectations would reduce the disinflationary cost and uncertainties associated with this process.",
        "Finally, in the balance of risks, most of the debate was, on the one hand, between a greater deanchoring of inflation expectations in longer terms and, on the other hand, a more abrupt reduction in the domestic or global credit granting affecting the economic activity.",
        "Lastly, the Committee reinforced that the harmony between monetary and fiscal policies reduces distortions and uncertainty, facilitates the disinflationary process, and fosters full employment over time.",
        "In this regard, the Committee reinforces the importance that public and private credit granting remains at competitive interest rates sensitive to the Selic.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a larger degree, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment.",
        "Taking into account the uncertainty of the scenarios, the Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets, which have shown additional deterioration, especially at longer horizons.",
        "The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "The Copom members analyzed the recent performance and prospects for the Brazilian and international economies, under the monetary policy framework, whose objective is to comply with the inflation targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In case of inconsistency, the Portuguese version prevails.",
        "The episodes involving banks abroad have increased the uncertainty, but with limited contagion on financial conditions so far, requiring constant monitoring.",
        "The impact of these episodes on financial conditions and consequently on global growth is still uncertain but has a negative bias.",
        "Major economies have emphasized the principle of separation of objectives and instruments in the conduct of monetary and macroprudential policies, despite incorporating the impacts on activity in their scenarios.",
        "At the same time, the central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets, in an environment in which inflation has been resilient.",
        "Recent inflation readings from several countries point to some stabilization of core inflation at levels above their targets and reinforce the persistent nature of the current inflationary process.",
        "Furthermore, most monetary authorities signal a prolonged period of high interest rates necessary to fight inflationary pressures, which calls for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging countries.",
        "Turning to the Brazilian economy, the Committee's expected scenario of gradual growth slowdown is still corroborated by the recent set of indicators.",
        "Some moderation is observed in the coincident indicators of activity, as well as a slowdown in the credit market at the margin.",
        "The labor market, which surprised positively throughout 2022, has shown resilience, with a net increase in job creation and relative stability in the unemployment rate.",
        "In assessing the factors that could lead to unfold an alternative scenario characterized by a higher neutral interest rate, emphasis was placed on the possible adoption of expansionary parafiscal policies, which can increase the neutral rate and reduce the power of monetary policy, as previously remarked by the Committee.",
        "Still regarding the debate about the current neutral interest rate in the economy, some members raised an additional aspect, related to the recent economic data set.",
        "May 2-3 in major economies, resilience in Brazilian activity, and a slow disinflationary process could be compatible with a higher measure of neutral rate than that assumed by the Committee.",
        "Under this argument, therefore, the current monetary tightening would lead to a lower contractionary impact than that implicit in the Copom's scenarios.",
        "However, most of the committee members judged that this interpretation still seems premature and needs further corroboration by data.",
        "Regarding the global outlook, the low degree of labor market slack in some economies and a persistently high current inflation and widespread in the services sector suggest that inflationary pressures should last longer.",
        "In this context, reducing inflationary pressures continues to require the commitment and determination of central banks to control inflation by maintaining the tightening of financial conditions for a longer period.",
        "Such determination, with a likely impact upon asset prices in the short term, coupled with a credit slowdown in major economies, contributes to a more credible and lasting global disinflationary process.",
        "Despite the limited contagion from the recent financial instability in the US banking sector, a further tightening of credit conditions is observed in that country.",
        "Thus, despite the reduction in the likelihood of a disruption in the credit market, a scenario with a more restricted credit supply and, consequently, lower economic growth, prevails.",
        "The Committee will continue to monitor this situation, analyzing possible transmission channels, although the direct impact on the domestic financial system is deemed limited.",
        "The Committee reinforces that the best contribution of monetary policy is to fight inflationary pressures and smooth economic fluctuations, and it emphasizes, once again, the separation of instruments between the objectives of inflation control and financial stability.",
        "Brazilian activity data point to a moderate pace of growth at the margin, with emphasis on the support given by consumption, on the demand side, and by the agricultural and livestock sector, on the supply side.",
        "Some members reminded that the methodological changes in monthly activity surveys may increase uncertainty in GDP projections and in the current assessment of activity.",
        "Copom anticipates a more vigorous GDP growth in the release of the first quarter of 2023, especially due to agricultural production, followed by moderation in economic activity in an environment marked by resilience in the labor market.",
        "In addition, formal employment data continued to reveal increase of job creation in the most recent period.",
        "Some members noted that there is a movement towards a partial recomposition of recent losses in real wages.",
        "This movement is expected and has been accompanied by a deceleration in nominal gains, which is expected to intensify ahead.",
        "Finally, it was noted that the economic growth outlook has not changed significantly in the recent period.",
        "The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics continues to be characterized by a process with two distinct stages.",
        "In the first stage, already completed, the speed of disinflation was greater, with a greater effect on administered prices and an indirect effect on market prices through less inertia.",
        "In the second stage, which has been currently observed, the speed of disinflation is slower, and core inflation which is more affected by the aggregate demand and the interest rate policy declines at a slower pace, responding to the output gap and future inflation expectations.",
        "The most recent inflationary data support the view of a slower disinflation process, in line with the view of an inflation driven by excess of demand, mostly in the services segment.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that the disinflation process at its current stage demands serenity and patience in the conduct of monetary policy to ensure the convergence of inflation to its targets.",
        "Still in the discussion about inflationary behavior, the recent benign behavior of wholesale prices was emphasized, both for food and industrial goods, in line with the Committee's view.",
        "In addition, due to a comfortable water scenario for 2023, the green energy flag is assumed for December.",
        "In terms of the trajectory of consumer inflation over 2023, it should be noted that a relevant drop is expected in the twelve-month inflation during this second quarter, due to the base effect of the previous year.",
        "In the second half of 2023, as the twelve-month inflation no longer includes the effects of the tax measures that reduced the price level in the third quarter of 2022 and the effects of this year's tax measures will still be included, this inflation indicator will rise.",
        "Copom, therefore, emphasizes that such behavior does not reflect the underlying inflationary dynamics, nor does it change the view on future prospects.",
        "Inflation expectations remain deanchored from the targets set by the National Monetary Council, having slightly deteriorated at the margin.",
        "The Committee is following this movement with concern and continues to assess that deanchored expectations raise the cost of bringing inflation back to the target.",
        "It was emphasized again that the behavior of expectations is a fundamental aspect of the inflationary process since it serves as a guide for present and future prices and wages setting.",
        "Thus, as expectations rise, there is a greater rise in prices in the current period and the inflationary process is fueled by these expectations.",
        "It was also highlighted that the anchoring of expectations is a key factor for price stability.",
        "In this context, the Committee reinforces that decisions that induce to the reanchoring of expectations and that raise confidence in the inflation targets would contribute to a faster and less costly disinflation process.",
        "The domestic credit granting scenario seems compatible with the current stage of the monetary policy cycle, despite the persistence of a stronger decrease in the supply of credit in specific modalities.",
        "The Committee anticipates a moderation in credit granting over the next few months, but in line with what has been observed in previous monetary policy tightening cycles.",
        "The Committee believes that the BCB has the appropriate and necessary liquidity instruments, associated with macroprudential policy, to deal with relevant frictions in the system, should they occur.",
        "The Committee also discussed the impacts of the fiscal scenario on inflation and assesses that the presentation of the fiscal framework has reduced the uncertainty associated with extreme scenarios of public debt growth.",
        "The Committee will continue to monitor the processing and implementation of the fiscal framework presented by the government and under discussion in the National Congress.",
        "Copom again emphasized that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the approval of the fiscal framework since the inflation path is conditional on the reaction of inflation expectations and financial conditions.",
        "The materialization of a scenario with a solid and credible fiscal framework may lead to a more benign disinflation process through its effect on the expectations channel, by reducing inflation expectations, uncertainty in the economy, the risk premium associated with domestic assets and, consequently, the Committee's projections.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "On the other hand, the current scenario, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower in an environment of deanchored inflation expectations, requires further attention when conducting monetary policy.",
        "Copom emphasizes that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the approval of the fiscal framework, and judges that the deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In this scenario, Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets.",
        "Copom started the debate by evaluating whether the previously outlined strategy of stable interest rates would be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation towards to its targets.",
        "To this end, the Committee has continued its process of analyzing the main determinants of the inflation path and how they have behaved in the most recent period.",
        "No significant change occurred in the prospective scenario for the output gap.",
        "As for services inflation and measures of core inflation, increased resilience and lower speed are observed in the recent releases, in line with the non-linear process already anticipated by Copom.",
        "In addition, inflation expectations remain deanchored, partially related to the questioning about a possible change in future inflation targets.",
        "Finally, in the balance of risks, besides the factors already mentioned, the Committee evaluates that the probability of the most extreme scenarios for the public debt trajectory has reduced, but also noted that there was no relevant change in the inflation projections since expectations did not change significantly.",
        "This behavior reinforces the understanding that there is no mechanical relationship between monetary policy and the fiscal framework.",
        "Copom emphasized that the conduct of monetary policy, at this moment, requires serenity and patience to incorporate the inherent delays in the inflation control through interest rates and, therefore, to reach the goals in the relevant monetary policy horizon.",
        "Therefore, the Committee assessed that the scenarios that could require a resumption of the monetary policy tightening cycle have become less likely.",
        "The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes the year of Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment.",
        "Taking into account the uncertainty of the scenarios, the Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The Committee judges that the current scenario demands patience and serenity in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Copom emphasizes that, although a less likely scenario, it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.",
        "At the same time, the central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets, in an environment in which inflation has been resilient.",
        "Recent inflation readings from several countries point to some stabilization of core inflation at levels above their targets and reinforce the persistent nature of the current inflationary process.",
        "Furthermore, it has been recently observed the resumption of the cycle of interest rate hikes in some economies that, in their majority, signal a prolonged period of high interest rates to fight inflationary pressures, which calls for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging countries.",
        "Regarding the domestic scenario, the recent set of indicators suggests a scenario of gradual deceleration.",
        "The release of the GDP for the first quarter of 2023 surprised positively, with most of the surprise reflecting the agricultural performance, but with less dynamism in the more cyclical economic sectors.",
        "The labor market, which surprised positively throughout 2022, has shown some resilience, with a net increase in job creation and relative stability in the unemployment rate.",
        "However, a reduction in the participation rate was observed.",
        "Consumer inflation has been reduced in the recent period, with emphasis on the dynamics in industrial goods and food.",
        "Copom members evaluated the different factors that justify an increase and converged on the conclusion that there was a rise in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the mentioned factors that support the increase of the neutral interest rates are the likely increase of neutral interest rates in the major economies, the resilience in the Brazilian economic activity jointly with a slow disinflationary process, as well as an analysis of supporting models that incorporate different methodologies.",
        "However, some factors might reduce external inflationary pressures.",
        "First among these is the commitment of central banks to the control of inflation by maintaining tighter financial conditions for a longer period.",
        "Such determination, albeit with a likely impact upon domestic asset prices in the short term, coupled with a credit slowdown in major economies, contributes to a more credible and lasting global disinflationary process.",
        "Besides, the recent dynamics of the exchange rate and international commodity prices, although with greater volatility, also contribute to slowdown international pressures.",
        "Brazilian activity data, in particular the release of the GDP growth for the first quarter of 2023, continues to indicate a deceleration in the sectors most sensitive to the economic cycle.",
        "At the margin, the pace of growth was moderate, except for the strong growth of the agricultural sector.",
        "In any case, it is anticipated that after this greater growth in the agricultural sector in the first quarter has passed due to the seasonality of the harvest the process of moderating growth in the more cyclical sectors of the economy will deepen over the following quarters.",
        "The Committee debated the recent labor market data.",
        "On the one hand, formal employment data continued to reveal increase in job creation in the most recent period.",
        "On the other hand, the unemployment rate remains relatively stable, but with a lower participation rate than in the pre-pandemic period.",
        "The Committee discussed the possible reasons for the fall in the participation rate, evaluating whether this movement should be read as structural or cyclical, which would have different impacts on the participation rate in effect in the long term.",
        "Some members noted that the recent process towards a partial recomposition of losses in real wages moves forward.",
        "This movement is expected and has been accompanied by a deceleration in nominal gains, which is expected to intensify ahead.",
        "The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics is still characterized by a process with two distinct stages.",
        "In the first stage, already completed, the speed of disinflation was greater, with a greater effect on administered prices and an indirect effect on market prices through less inertia.",
        "In the second stage, which is currently observed, the speed of disinflation is slower, and core inflation which is more affected by the aggregate demand and the interest rate policy declines at a slower pace, responding to the output gap and future inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that the disinflation process at its current stage demands serenity and patience in the conduct of monetary policy to ensure the convergence of inflation to its targets.",
        "Still in the discussion about inflationary behavior, the recent benign behavior of wholesale prices was emphasized, both for food and industrial goods.",
        "On the food front, logistical issues, together with favorable weather and a good harvest contributed to a revision in the outlook for food prices for 2023 and, to a lesser extent, for For the latter, however, the uncertainty about the impact of the El Nio phenomenon stands out.",
        "Regarding industrial goods, wholesale prices, as well as the normalization of supply chains, have also led to a revision in the dynamics of these sectors.",
        "The Committee assesses that the consolidation of such dynamics contributes to the disinflationary process and should have some indirect impact on the other items.",
        "In terms of the trajectory of consumer inflation over 2023, it should be noted that the continuity of the drop is expected in the twelve-month inflation during this second quarter, due to the base effect of the previous year.",
        "For the second half of 2023, however, a higher twelve-month inflation is expected, as a consequence of the exclusion in this indicator of the effect of the tax measures that reduced the price level in the third quarter of 2022 and of the maintenance of the effects of this year's tax measures.",
        "Copom emphasizes that it will also continue to monitor inflationary dynamics in underlying inflation measures, which best reflect the current inflation trend as well as its prospects.",
        "The Committee continues to assess that deanchored expectations raise the cost of bringing inflation back to the target.",
        "It was emphasized again that the behavior of expectations is a fundamental aspect of the inflationary process since it serves as a guide for present and future prices and wages setting.",
        "Thus, as expectations rise, there is a greater upward pressure on prices in the current period and the inflationary process is fueled by these expectations.",
        "It was also highlighted that the anchoring of expectations is a key factor for price stability.",
        "In this context, the Committee reinforces that decisions that induce the reanchoring of expectations and that raise confidence in inflation targets would contribute to a faster and less costly disinflation process, allowing monetary easing.",
        "The domestic credit granting scenario is compatible with the current stage of the monetary policy cycle.",
        "The Committee anticipates a moderation in credit granting over the next few months, but in line with what has been observed in previous monetary policy tightening cycles.",
        "The Committee stresses that the BCB has the appropriate and necessary liquidity instruments, associated with macroprudential policy, to deal with relevant frictions in the system, should they occur.",
        "The Committee also discussed the impacts of the fiscal scenario on inflation and assesses that the presentation and processing of the fiscal framework have substantially reduced the uncertainty surrounding fiscal risk.",
        "Challenges to meet the targets set for the primary result remain, although in the Committee's discussion, the commitment and the presentation of measures to achieve these results were emphasized.",
        "Copom again emphasized that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the approval of the fiscal framework since the inflation path is conditional on the reaction of inflation expectations and financial conditions.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "The Committee judges that the current context, marked by unanchored expectations for longer terms and characterized by a stage of the disinflationary process that tends to be slower, requires parsimony and caution in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee unanimously believes that flexibilization of the degree of monetary tightening requires confidence in the trajectory of the disinflation process, since premature flexibilization could lead to a reacceleration of the inflationary process and, consequently, to a reversal of the monetary easing process itself.",
        "In this debate, a divergence was observed in the Committee concerning the degree of signaling regarding the next steps.",
        "Another group was more cautious, emphasizing that the disinflationary dynamics still reflects the retreat of the most volatile components and that the uncertainty about the output gap creates doubt about the impact of the monetary tightening implemented so far.",
        "For this group, it is necessary to observe further reanchoring of long-term expectations and accumulate more evidence of disinflation in the more cyclically sensitive components.",
        "However, the Committee members unanimously agreed that the future steps of monetary policy will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "Following the usual analysis, the Committee discussed the different determinants that impact the conduct of the monetary policy.",
        "Resilience of the economic activity in the first quarter was discussed, but the Committee's view remains that growth was driven by the agricultural sector and that the other sectors should show modest growth throughout As for services inflation and core inflation a slow deceleration movement is observed, in line with the non-linear process anticipated by the Committee.",
        "In addition, inflation expectations declined slightly, but remain deanchored, partially due to the questioning about a possible change in future inflation targets.",
        "The Committee believes that decisions that reanchor expectations can lead to faster disinflation.",
        "Copom's inflation projections have been reduced, especially in the relevant scenario, to a large extent due to lower inflation expectations.",
        "Finally, on the balance of risks, the Committee assesses that uncertainty about the final design of the fiscal framework is residual.",
        "Besides this, it noted that part of the downward risk coming from commodity prices has already materialized in the recent period.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower and in an environment of deanchored inflation expectations continues to require caution and parsimony.",
        "Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets and judges that the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a long period has been adequate to ensure the convergence of inflation.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "At the same time, the central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets, either by continuing their monetary tightening cycles or by signaling a prolonged period of high interest rates to fight inflationary pressures or indicating a pause period still in a cycle of interest rate increase.",
        "The Committee noted an increase in long-term interest rates in the United States as well as forecasts of lower growth in China, both demanding further attention from emerging market economies.",
        "Regarding the domestic outlook, the recent set of indicators suggests a scenario of stronger resilience of the economic activity.",
        "Economic activity data for the second quarter, particularly the GDP release, indicate the persistence of the dynamics of non- cyclical economic sectors as well as the expansion in the demand component relative to household consumption.",
        "Generally speaking, in the sectoral indicators, there are some deceleration in the trade sector, moderate reacceleration in industry, and stability in the services sector growth, after a stronger growth pace in previous quarters.",
        "The labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin.",
        "Consumer inflation continues on a more benign trajectory, decelerating in both services and core inflation.",
        "Despite declining, the inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which have greater inflationary inertia, remains above target.",
        "A disinflation process is observed, reflecting the reduction of pressures on commodities after the initial impacts of the war in Ukraine, the early effects of the monetary policy tightening, and the normalization of productive sectors, but with a slow decline in core inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, uncertainties remain about the global inflation dynamics.",
        "Risks related to weather phenomena, the war in Ukraine, and international oil pricing policy suggest the possibility of renewed supply-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Furthermore, the labor market is resilient, and the output gap is tight in advanced economies, in an environment of still pressured services inflation in several economies.",
        "Conversely, central banks remain committed to controlling inflation by maintaining a tighter monetary policy for a longer period.",
        "Restrictive monetary policies in advanced economies have been fundamental in containing world inflation, facilitating the control of inflation in emerging countries.",
        "September 19-20 in the short term.",
        "The global growth scenario has been characterized by the resilience of activity and labor market in the US, as opposed to an outlook of lower growth for the Chinese economy.",
        "In this context some members see a mild moderation in activity in major economies as more likely, particularly in the US economy, although a sharper slowdown is not ruled out.",
        "Conversely, some members continued to emphasize the risks of a synchronized deceleration.",
        "In its discussion, the Committee evaluates that part of the lower Chinese economy growth is structural, but the magnitude of the countercyclical responses that might be implemented will help determining not only the growth dynamics but also its impacts on commodity prices and on the Brazilian economy.",
        "Regarding the increase of long-term interest rates in advanced economies, Copom pondered whether this movement might reflect the perception of an increased neutral interest rate in these countries, higher potential output, seasonal lack of market liquidity, or higher fiscal premium due to persistent nominal deficits.",
        "In its discussion, Copom mostly emphasized the fiscal prospects, particularly in the US, and how this would impact global financial conditions.",
        "Still in the external scenario, the Committee discussed the causes for the economic activity resilience observed in several economies, concomitantly to the disinflationary process, even in face of historically strong monetary tightening cycles.",
        "Some members noted still high latent impacts of fiscal stimuli in relevant economies.",
        "However, it was emphasized that the commitment of the central banks of major economies to bring inflation back to the target and the credibility achieved, allowing a solid anchoring of inflation expectations, have contributed to disinflationary processes sacrificing less the economic activity.",
        "Regarding the domestic economic activity, the Committee held a wide-ranging debate on why a more resilient growth has been seen in recent quarters.",
        "The first possibility is that the strong performance of the agriculture and livestock sector might have had indirect effects on other economic sectors.",
        "Although corroborated by data, it does not justify the entire magnitude of the surprise.",
        "Another possibility is that the expansion of disposable income, as the result of the labor market dynamics, decline of food prices, or income transfer programs, has also provided some support to consumption.",
        "Copom focused on this issue, deemed of high relevance, and stressed that the assumption of a growth sustained by the increase of income is corroborated by the resilience in the consumption of services rendered to households.",
        "Consequently, the Committee also discussed the possible impact on the dynamics of the services inflation if growth is sustained by income and consumption.",
        "Another possibility, albeit with lower impact on short-term changes, would be a higher neutral interest rate.",
        "The Committee, however, decided to maintain its more recent assessment about the neutral interest rate disclosed in the June 2023 Inflation Report.",
        "Finally, Copom discussed whether the potential growth would have increased over the last quarters, in view of regulatory reforms and institutional advances.",
        "Although judging premature to reevaluate at this moment the potential growth, Copom argues that the persistence of a resilient growth over the next quarters with no inflationary impact might, in the future, lead to the reevaluation of the potential growth.",
        "Copom perceived that each of these four possibilities has different implications for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Copom reinforced its view that the lack of commitment to structural reforms, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential of raising the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the power of monetary policy and, consequently, on the cost of disinflation in terms of activity.",
        "Again, an in-depth discussion of developments in the labor market took place.",
        "Other members emphasized the drop in the unemployment rate and the still high pace of hirings in formal employment.",
        "The Committee agreed that there is no evidence of high wage pressures in labor negotiations.",
        "Considering recently released data, Copom judges that the output gap is tighter than previously estimated but continues to anticipate a scenario of economic deceleration over the next quarters.",
        "Copom analyzed different output gap measures and the impacts on projections of distinct assumptions.",
        "In its discussion, Copom judged that there are elements that increase the uncertainty of estimates and add an upward bias to the revisions of the output gap estimates used by the Committee.",
        "In particular, Copom again noted that the impact of the pandemic period makes more difficult the inference about the output gap.",
        "Copom still assesses that the deceleration in the credit granting is in line with the monetary policy stance.",
        "A stronger deceleration was observed in the corporate credit granting, whereas, in the household segment, the deceleration was smaller, being less intense in low-cost credit modalities.",
        "Despite the tight monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the transmission of the monetary policy cycle expected by the market to the interest rates of new credit granting is already seen, also increasing the dynamics of the capital markets.",
        "Finally, Copom assesses that part of the uncertainty observed in the markets, with increased risk premia and break-even inflation, was previously more related to the final design of the fiscal framework, and currently it is more associated with the execution of revenue and spending measures consistent with the framework and the achievement of the fiscal targets.",
        "Given the importance of the execution of the fiscal targets already established for the anchoring of inflation expectations, and hence for the conduct of monetary policy, the Committee reinforces the importance of firmly pursuing those targets.",
        "Copom judged that the evolution of the current inflation scenario is benign, as already expected.",
        "The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics is still characterized by a process with two distinct stages.",
        "The first stage showed a benign dynamics of food and industrial prices and the trajectory of wholesale prices.",
        "The second stage, begun in the recent period, continued to show a benign dynamics of food and wholesale prices, in addition to a deceleration in the prices of services and underlying services.",
        "The discussion about services inflation focused again on its determinants.",
        "Members discussed the realignment of relative prices and the role played by the labor market and the output gap for the inflation prospects.",
        "On the other hand, the components related to industrial goods and administered prices might present a less benign behavior than previously expected, due to the recent movement of the exchange rate and the prices of international commodities.",
        "Copom still assesses that the inherent volatility of food and industrial goods components suggests the possibility of abrupt reversals, recommending caution.",
        "In this debate, the risks related to the El _Nio weather phenomenon partially incorporated into the reference scenario were_ mentioned, as well as those related to international oil price developments.",
        "In the projections, the latter followed the Committees usual governance in its assumptions.",
        "Copom highlighted the uncertainty surrounding El Nio in terms of its magnitude, the period in which the phenomenon would have the greatest impact, and the particular impacts on different food products.",
        "Copom opted to incorporate a relatively small impact of the El Nio into its food inflation projections, but some members stressed the inflationary impacts in the event of a more extreme phenomenon.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a contractionary and cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Inflation expectations, after partially reanchoring, are still a matter of concern.",
        "September 19-20 target inflation expectations would be fiscal concerns, fears about global disinflation, and the possible perception by analysts that Copom could become more lenient in the fight against inflation over time.",
        "Therefore, Copom assesses that the reduction of expectations will come through a firm conduct, in line with the goal of strengthening the credibility and the reputation of both institutions and economic frameworks.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "Inflation expectations remain above target and have been relatively stable recently.",
        "Some members were particularly concerned about the possibility of deanchored targets for an extended period.",
        "Secondly, the process of disinflation continues, with services inflation decelerating at the margin.",
        "Some members emphasized in particular the recent benign composition of inflation and the decrease in services inflation, while others stressed that the underlying fundamentals for the dynamics of services inflation, particularly the resilience of economic activity and the labor market, do not yet allow for a convincing extrapolation of the recent benign behavior.",
        "Regarding the output gap, there was a tightening at the margin, due to a greater resilience of economic activity.",
        "The implications of alternative ways of measuring the output gap and its respective impacts on the projections were also assessed.",
        "Finally, it was noted that there was an increase in the projections in the reference scenario, mainly due to a tighter output gap and the change in conditioning factors, such as the rise in the oil price, foreign exchange rate depreciation, and the reduction in the Selic trajectory in the Focus survey.",
        "After the scenario evaluation, all members agreed that it was appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point to adjust the degree of prospective monetary tightening.",
        "Regarding the next steps, Copom members unanimously anticipated cuts of 0.50 percentage point in the next meetings and judged that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "This pace brings together, on the one hand, the firm commitment with the reanchoring of expectations and the disinflationary dynamics and, on the other hand, the adjustment in the level of monetary tightening in real terms in face of the more benign dynamics of the anticipated inflation in the reference scenario projections.",
        "Copom also evaluated that there is no evidence of an ongoing monetary tightening beyond that necessary for the inflation convergence to the target, and the scenario still calls for caution, reinforcing the view of serenity and moderation that Copom has expressed.",
        "The Committee judges that there is low probability of an additional intensification in the pace of adjustment, since this would require substantial positive surprises that would raise even further the confidence in the prospective disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Such confidence would arise only with a significant change in the fundamentals of inflation dynamics, such as a much more solid reanchoring of expectations, a sharp widening of the output gap, or a services inflation dynamics substantially more benign than the expected.",
        "Finally, the Committee debated the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle.",
        "It was emphasized, in this analysis, the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower and with partial reanchoring of inflation expectations, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates, and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "If the scenario evolves as expected, the Committee members unanimously anticipate further reductions of the same magnitude in the next meetings and judge that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "At the same time, the central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets, either by continuing their monetary tightening cycles or by signaling a prolonged period of high interest rates to fight inflationary pressures.",
        "This stance continues to call for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies, particularly by emerging countries.",
        "Regarding the domestic scenario, the recent set of indicators suggests a scenario of gradual deceleration of activity.",
        "Apart from the strong performance of agriculture, concentrated in the first quarter, the pace of activity growth continues to corroborate the scenario anticipated by the Committee.",
        "In general, there is some retraction in the trade sector, stability in industry and some accommodation in the services sector, after a stronger growth pace in previous quarters.",
        "The labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin.",
        "Consumer inflation continues to show more benign current dynamics, particularly in industrial goods and food components.",
        "Although the inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which have greater inflationary inertia, declined, they remain above the inflation target.",
        "The Committee noted the resilience of activity and the labor market in advanced economies, even if some moderation is observed at the margin, as well as lower growth projection for the Chinese economy.",
        "In this context some members see a mild moderation in activity in major economies as more likely, although a sharper slowdown is not ruled out.",
        "A disinflation process at the margin is observed, reflecting the slowdown of commodity pressures after the initial impacts of the war in Ukraine and the normalization of productive sectors, but with a slow decline in core inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, uncertainties remain about the global inflation dynamics.",
        "The downward movement in commodity prices has stalled in the recent period, and risks related to weather phenomena, the war in Ukraine, and international oil pricing policy suggest the possibility of renewed supply-side inflationary pressures.",
        "Furthermore, it is observed resilience of the labor market and tight output gap in advanced economies, in an environment of still pressured services inflation in several economies.",
        "Thus, central banks remain committed to control inflation by maintaining tighter monetary policy for a longer period.",
        "Such determination, albeit with a likely impact upon domestic asset prices in the short term, coupled with a credit slowdown in major economies, contributes to a more credible and lasting global disinflationary process.",
        "The larger-than-expected upward impact on inflation of the synchronization of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies across countries during the pandemic was mentioned again.",
        "Growth data for Brazil remain consistent with the reference scenario of moderating activity anticipated by the Committee.",
        "The process of rebalancing the consumption basket, and, consequently, relative prices, between goods and services continues, with moderation in the consumption of goods in favor of greater demand in the services segment.",
        "However, the services sector has been moderating in recent months.",
        "In addition, more timely data continue to suggest that the pace of economic growth is in line with the Committee's expectations.",
        "Again, an in-depth discussion of developments in the labor market took place.",
        "Some members still consider that there is a recent moderation in the labor market, which points to the slowdown in the pace of hirings in the formal market and the decline in the participation rate.",
        "Other members emphasized the drop in the unemployment rate and the still high pace of hirings in formal employment.",
        "The Committee agreed that there is no evidence of high wage pressures in labor negotiations.",
        "Some members noted that the recent process towards a partial recomposition of previous losses in real wages moves forward.",
        "This movement is expected and has been accompanied by a deceleration in nominal gains, which is expected to intensify ahead.",
        "The Committee analyzed different output gap metrics and assumptions, comparing not only the estimate of the current gap level under different methods, but also their impacts on the inflation projection.",
        "It was noted that the speed with which the gap is assumed to close over the projection horizon is as important as the initial level assumed for the gap.",
        "It was then discussed the risk that the output gap is tighter than assumed in the reference scenario, in particular in the labor market, and assessed the impacts of this alternative assumption on inflation projections.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the output gap is an unobservable variable, subject to uncertainty in its measurement and with even greater uncertainty after the pandemic period.",
        "The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics continues to be characterized by a process with two distinct stages.",
        "The first-stage movement proved deeper than expected, given the more benign dynamics of food and industrial prices and the behavior of wholesale prices.",
        "In this regard, the recent dynamics of the exchange rate and international commodity prices, although with greater volatility, has contributed to slow down international pressures on inflation in Brazil.",
        "On the one hand, this phenomenon improves the dynamics of the second stage of disinflation, with lower inertia on core inflation and services inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the inherent volatility of food and industrial goods components suggests the possibility of abrupt reversals, recommending caution.",
        "In this debate, the risks related to El Nio, which were partially incorporated into the reference scenario, were mentioned, as were those related to international oil price developments, which followed the Committee's usual governance in its assumptions.",
        "In the end, it was unanimously concluded that a contractionary and cautious monetary policy was needed to reinforce the disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Also in the discussion on inflationary behavior, the current stage of the disinflationary process and the recent behavior of services inflation were discussed in depth.",
        "It was noted that the indicators of this segment point to continuity in the trajectory of disinflation in the recent period, despite some oscillation at levels still above the value compatible with the target.",
        "In such a discussion, it was emphasized that it is more relevant to focus on its underlying fundamentals in particular, possible changes in the labor market and in the dynamics of activity than on punctual movements in services inflation, relative to some component or some period.",
        "Therefore, there was a positive impact on inflation expectations immediately after the CMN's decision, reinforcing the interpretation that the inflation targeting regime has gained credibility.",
        "However, the reanchoring is still partial and the Committee discussed again the reasons for such deanchoring.",
        "The Committee removed residual uncertainty about the approval of the fiscal framework from its balance of risks but noted in its discussion that fiscal dynamics remained relevant in its reference scenario.",
        "In particular, some members assessed that some uncertainty persists among agents about overcoming fiscal challenges, evidenced in primary balance expectations that diverge from the targets set by the government, and that this may also be reflected in unanchored inflation expectations for longer maturities.",
        "In this case, anchoring expectations around the targets set out in the new fiscal framework, with the maintenance of the fiscal commitment in addition to a reduction in uncertainties about the tax measures that underpin the implementation of this objective, would contribute to a faster disinflationary process.",
        "Others evaluated that a global scenario with higher inflation also makes it difficult to reanchor expectations, since there is a possibility of external inflation at higher levels for a longer period.",
        "Copom members unanimously understand that, regardless of the BCBs board composition, the Institutions credibility and reputation should be ensured.",
        "Copom reminds that structural reforms and the predictability of public accounts are essential to increase the economys productivity, raise the potential growth, and improve the confidence of business, investors, and households.",
        "The lack of commitment with structural reforms, the increase of earmarked credit granting, and the uncertainties about the stabilization of the public debt have the potential to raise the neutral interest rate of the economy, with harmful impacts on the monetary policy power and, consequently, on its cost to the economy.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.",
        "This evaluation involved different dimensions.",
        "Firstly, it was emphasized the positive behavior of inflation expectations following the setting of the target by the CMN and the announcement of the change to a continuous target system.",
        "Secondly, headline inflation measures registered a clear improvement, while services inflation continues decelerating at the margin.",
        "Some members emphasized the recent dynamics, while others emphasized that the underlying fundamentals for the dynamics of services inflation do not allow yet to convincingly extrapolate the recent benign behavior.",
        "Regarding the output gap, some members noted the upward revision in its estimate, and the Committee discussed the implications of alternative output gap measures from other models and their respective impacts on projections.",
        "Finally, it was observed that the partial reanchoring of expectations contributed to reducing projections in the reference scenario.",
        "During the debate, the Committee judged that both the options of reducing the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point or 0.50 percentage point had merit, reinforcing that, whatever the decision, there was a consensus that a scenario with inflation expectations with only a partial reanchoring, core inflation still above the target, services inflation still above the level compatible with the inflation target, and resilient economic activity requires a more conservative stance throughout the cycle of monetary policy easing.",
        "One group was in favor of a more parsimonious interest rate reduction.",
        "For this group, the Committees signaling itself already emphasized the caution and parsimony inherent to this scenario and, according to these members, no relevant changes had been observed either in the scenario or in Copom's projections that justified the re- evaluation of this signaling.",
        "Other group considered that the monetary policy stance at a significantly contractionary degree allows the start of the cycle already at the moderate pace considered for the next meetings, without compromising the commitment to achieve the target and the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "Regarding the next steps, Copom members unanimously anticipated cuts of 0.50 percentage point in the next meetings and judged that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "This pace brings together, on the one hand, the firm commitment with the reanchoring of expectations and the disinflationary dynamics and, on the other hand, the adjustment in the level of monetary tightening in real terms in face of the more benign dynamics of the anticipated inflation in the reference scenario projections.",
        "Copom also evaluated that there is no evidence of an ongoing monetary tightening beyond that necessary for the inflation convergence to the target, and the scenario still calls for caution, reinforcing the view of serenity and moderation that Copom has expressed.",
        "The Committee judges that there is low probability of an additional intensification in the pace of adjustment, since this would require substantial positive surprises that would raise even further the confidence in the prospective disinflationary dynamics.",
        "Such confidence would arise only with a significant change in the fundamentals of inflation dynamics, such as a much more solid reanchoring of expectations, a sharp widening of the output gap, or a services inflation dynamics substantially more benign than the expected.",
        "Finally, the Committee debated the extension of the monetary policy adjustments cycle.",
        "It was emphasized, in this analysis, the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "Copom emphasized that the extension of the cycle over time will depend on the inflationary dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks.",
        "The Committee maintains its firm commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon and reinforces that the extension of the cycle will reflect the BCBs legal mandate.",
        "The Committee reinforces the need to persist on a contractionary monetary policy until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets.",
        "The current context, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower and with partial reanchoring of inflation expectations, requires serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "If the scenario evolves as expected, the Committee members unanimously anticipate further reductions of the same magnitude in the next meetings, and it judges that this pace is appropriate to keep the necessary contractionary monetary policy for the disinflationary process.",
        "The Committee emphasizes that the total magnitude of the easing cycle throughout time will depend on the inflation dynamics, especially the components that are more sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, on inflation expectations, in particular the longer-term ones, on its inflation projections, on the output gap, and on the balance of risks."

        "The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over the households confidence and consumption.",

        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect, in a more long-lasting manner, the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant, to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",

        "The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and GDP growth rates have continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential.",
        "This process has been intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of non-economic events.",
        "In particular, investment has retreated, mainly influenced by the occurrence of these events, and private consumption also shows contraction signals, in line with recent data regarding credit, employment and income.",
        "However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which has been more intense and longer than the anticipated, the activity expansion pace tends to intensify, as companies and households confidence strengthen.",
        "Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and demand.",
        "Consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain momentum.",
        "These changes, coupled with other ones currently underway, anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential growth.",
        "Regarding the external component of aggregate demand, the scenario of higher global growth, combined with the depreciation of the BRL, contributes to make this component more favorable to the Brazilian economic growth.",
        "Regarding the supply side, the Committee evaluates that, in longer horizons, more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry, agriculture and livestock have emerged.",
        "The services sector, on its turn, tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent years.",
        "For the Committee, it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession - will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity gains.",
        "However, the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them depends fundamentally on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance sustainability, in addition to reducing uncertainties surrounding the domestic environment.",

        "Relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic cycle, the Committee considers that, during the relevant horizon for the monetary policy, the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral zone, and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint area, even if more slowly and with lower intensity than previously antecipated.",
        "However, the Committee notes that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses, as well as in its composition, impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding the macroeconomic environment and have negatively impacted inflation expectations.",

        "The Copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion, which had already been observed and tends to persist.",
        "Regarding this issue, it is important to highlight the fact that, after years of strong expansion, consumer credit has moderated, so that, over the last quarters, there was, on the one hand, exposure reduction by banks, and, on the other hand, deleveraging of the households.",

        "In spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimates for the labor productivity, the Committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost pressures.",
        "For the Copom, the fact that inflation stands at high levels reflects, in large part, the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy - the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market prices.",
        "The Committee also considers that, over 2015, these relative prices ajustments in the economy, among other factors, have made the balance of risks to inflation unfavorable.",
        "In this context, as anticipated in previous Minutes, these price adjustments caused inflation to rise in 2015, requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer horizons.",

        "For the Copom, the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels reflects, in large part, the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy - the realignment of domestic 5 prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market prices.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy.",
        "On the one hand, household consumption tends to stabilize, due to factors such as employment, income and credit; on the other hand, the real state financing, the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural income, among other factors, tend to benefit investments.",

        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom emphasizes that the international evidence, which is ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress investments.",
        "These distortions are manifested, for example, in the shortening of the planning horizons of households, companies and governments, as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over the households confidence and consumption.",

        "Regarding oil, the Committee highlights that, regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of gasoline, the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, and through inflation expectations.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and GDP growth rates continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential.",
        "This process is being intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of non-economic events.",
        "In particular, the investment has retreated, mainly influenced by the occurrence of these events, and private consumption shows contraction signals, in line with recent data regarding credit, employment and income.",
        "However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which may be more intense and longer than anticipated, the activity expansion pace tends to intensify, as companies and households confidence strengthen.",
        "Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and demand.",
        "Consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain momentum.",
        "These changes, coupled with other ones currently underway, anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential growth.",
        "Regarding the external component of aggregate demand, the scenario of higher global growth, combined with the depreciation of the BRL, contributes to make this component more favorable to the Brazilian economy growth.",

        "However, the prospects for a new change in the trajectories regarding fiscal variables, implicit in the budget proposal for 2016, affected the expectations and, signicantly, the asset prices.",
        "In this regard, the Committee notes that significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation impact the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a less positive perception of the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long terms.",
        "It also highlights that a primary surpluses path that strengthens the perception of sustainability of the public sector balance contributes to reduce the public debt financing cost, with favorable impact on the cost of capital in general and, at last, stimulating private investment in the medium and long run.",
        "Specifically regarding inflation control, the Committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy framework, in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to prices.",

        "The difference between the proportion of companies that reported excess inventories and those which reported insufficient inventories fell in February, similarly to what occurred in January.",
        "The recent process of retreat in the rates of installed capacity utilization reflected, in part, the reduction in the pace of production growth and the maturity of investments.",
        "Global economy faces a period of above-than-usual uncertainty, still showing deteriorated prospects for activity, despite some improvement, at the margin, and lower level of risk aversion.",
        "High persistent unemployment rates, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, the limited scope for anticyclical policy actions and the political uncertainty, have contributed, in general, for the reduction of growth projections in mature countries or even of their potential growth, indicating a wider and more volatile economic cycle.",

        "In emerging economies, in general, monetary policy bias is expansionist.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "In the recent past, the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global liquidity, in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in FX markets.",
        "Prospectively, it is plausible to affirm that the announcement by Chinese authorities of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities prices.",

        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premia, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and companies.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "In other words, high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment growth; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",

        "In other words, the moderation process the Brazilian economy was already experiencing in the first half of last year was intensified by the weakness of the global economy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, although domestic demand expansion has moderated, prospects for economic activity are favorable.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that, despite showing some cooling, point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers confidence, notwithstanding the accommodation at the margin, stands at historically high levels.",

        "However, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the long-term trend, in other works, is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "The Committee also observes that, in general, commodities prices in international markets have shown benign behavior.",
        "The Copom considers that the deceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second half of 2011 was higher than expected; that recent events indicate the postponement of a final solution for the European financial crisis; and that the risks associated to the deleveraging process stemming from banks, families and government - under way in major economic blocs persist.",
        "These and other elements, therefore, constitute an economic environment in which a much above-than-usual uncertainty level prevails.",
        "The Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, the inflation rate stands around the target in 2012, and assess as decreasing the risks for the materialization of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint target.",
        "In light of this, two members of the Committee consider that it would be opportune the maintenance of the pace of adjustment of the Selic rate.",
        "However, the majority argues that developments such as the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph recommend, at this time, the redistribution along time of the total adjustment of monetary conditions as the most appropriate strategy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand is still robust, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming quarters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, which are, in short, lagged and cumulative.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures.",
        "Another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial and persistent deterioration in the international scenario.",
        "These elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom understands that Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in the interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction of risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",
        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the 7 economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions can occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above, and considering the values projected for the inflation and the associated balance of risks, the Copom attributes high probability for the materialization of a scenario that considers the Selic rate moving to slightly above the historic lows levels, and stabilizing at these levels.",
        "The monthly result reflected the slowdown in market and regulated prices.",
        "The monthly IPCA-15 change reflected, mainly, the increase in prices of education, which contributed 0.25 p.p., followed by personal expenses, 0.11 p.p., while food and beverages, transport and clothing were the main drivers of the IPCA slowdown in February.",
        "The prices of agricultural and livestock products were mainly influenced by the prices of beans, eggs and corn, contributing 0.07 p.p., 0.06 p.p.",
        "and 0.05 p.p., respectively.",
        "Three out of the five IPCA-15 core measures calculated by the BCB decreased in February.",
        "All measures decelerated in the twelve months through February compared to the twelve months through January.",

        "In the twelve-month period ended in January, the index change reflected, in particular, the changes in the prices of food products, coke, oil and bio-fuels byproducts and automobile vehicles, shells and tows, which contributed 0.41 p.p.",
        "for the final result.",
        "The segments of capital and consumer goods rose 1 p.p.",
        "and 0.2 p.p., 10 respectively, month-on-month, while those regarding construction inputs and intermediate goods retracted 1 p.p.",

        "Compared to January 2011, the delinquency rate for credit operations with corporate changed 0.1 p.p., while the one relative to individuals increased 1.9 p.p..",
        "External Environment Prospects for world economic growth this year are subject to significant downward risks, considering the European crisis, the deceleration in world trade and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.",
        "However, the assessment of purchase managers pointed to increase in the global PMI to 54.6 points in January.",
        "In China, despite the deceleration of the external sector and the risks related to the real state sector, domestic demand continues robust.",
        "Under this scenario, characterized by an environment of some decrease in risk aversion, the dollar devaluated against currencies of emerging countries and lost strength against the euro, the sovereign risk premia retreated in Europe, and the CDS of European banks reduced as of mid-February.",
        "It bears noticing the strong increase in the oil price in the period, reflecting the worsening of geopolitical tensions related to Iran.",
        "It bears highlighting that new measures of quantitative easing were taken in Europe and in Japan.",
        "Therefore, the program of assets purchase of the BoE and BoJ were extended, respectively, by 50 billion pounds, to 325 billion pounds, and by 10 trillion yens, to 65 trillion yens.",
        "In the Euro Area, the LTRO conduced in December and in February supplied 489.2 billion euros and 529.2 billion euros, respectively.",
        "This movement was influenced, at the local scenario, by the expectation of continuity of the Selic rate reduction cycle, by the favorable trajectory of current inflation indices and by the announcement of the federal budget adjustment for At the external scenario, the uncertainties related to the restructuring of the Greek debt and the increase of global liquidity after the operation of supplying resources to the banking system promoted by the ECB contributed to the retraction of the interest rates.",
        "The rates for maturities of one, two and three years decreased by 0.97 p.p., 0.80 p.p.",
        "and 0.61 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB also borrowed money through 33 very short-term operations, and carried out leveling operations conducted at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days.",
        "The main factors that contributed to the contraction of liquidity in the period were the net revenues of the Union and the net placement of securities by the National Treasury.",
        "Underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB, in general, have performed similarly to headline inflation.",
        "In general, the recent evolution of the wholesale and producer price indices signals reduction of inflationary pressures in these segments.",
        "Indicators on credit conditions, based on quarterly survey carried on by the BCB with institutions representative of each segment of the credit market, evidence, in general, more flexible conditions in the second quarter of 2012, quarter-over-quarter.",
        "For micro, small and medium-sized companies, the indicators show increase in credit approval in the second quarter, quarter-overquarter, with moderately stronger demand and still moderately restrictive supply, but with lower intensity.",
        "Regarding credit for consumption, the expectation for the second quarter indicates reduction in the share of credit approval, compared to the observed in the last quarter.",
        "For housing credit, despite the supply at levels similar to those observed between January and March 2012, the expectation of demand expansion tends to confirm scenario with elevation in the share of approval.",
        "The February rate was 0.7 p.p.",
        "below the rate recorded in the same month last year.",
        "In short, the set of available data indicates that, although the labor market remains robust, there are signs of moderation at the margin.",
        "This indicator provides important additional information, as it portrays the current state and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely manner.",
        "In March the index evolved positively, after five negative figures, boosted by the improvement in expectations for the future.",
        "In the upcoming months, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth, by the improvement in the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit expansion.",
        "It is 3 worth noticing that the difference between the proportion of companies that reported excess inventories and those which reported insufficient inventories fell in March for the third consecutive month.",
        "Global economy continues to face a period of above-than-usual uncertainty, despite some stability in the risk aversion level, and with prospects of low growth.",
        "High persistent unemployment rates, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, the limited scope for anticyclical policy actions and the political uncertainty, have contributed for projections of low growth in mature economies, despite the heterogeneity among countries.",
        "At the same time, activity in China decelerated in the first quarter, and recorded the lowest growth rate since the first quarter of Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have persisted with strongly accommodative monetary stances and, in some cases, with non-conventional policy initiatives.",
        "Despite this fact, inflation core measures have continued at moderate levels both in the US and in the Euro Area and Japan, considering the relatively moderate prospects for the activity level.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, the monetary policy bias is expansionist.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "In the recent past, the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global liquidity, in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in FX markets.",
        "Prospectively, it is plausible to affirm that the Chinese authorities announcement of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities prices.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available information.",
        "The set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last years.",
        "As a working hypothesis, the main scenario also considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the Brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international crisis.",
        "It is noteworthy that part of this estimated impact is already being observed in the most recent economic activity indicators.",
        "For 2013, the inflation projection rose in the reference scenario and remained stable in the market scenario, standing above the midpoint target in both cases.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longer-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "In other words, high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment growth; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Committee understands that, in general, the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed little.",
        "It also notes that, in these economies, there seems to be limited scope for using monetary policy, and a scenario of fiscal restraint also prevails, in this and in the upcoming years.",
        "Moreover, in important emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity has moderated, in part, as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external demand, through the external trade channel.",
        "In specific cases, changes in the growth pattern are anticipated, a development that tends to be permanent.",
        "Therefore, until now, the Committee evaluates that the international scenario has shown disinflationary bias.",
        "For the Copom, there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy materializes through several channels, among others, moderation of total trade, moderation in investment flows and tighter credit conditions.",
        "The Committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity.",
        "In other words, the moderation process the Brazilian economy was already experiencing in the first half of last year was intensified by the weakness of the global economy.",
        "The Copom evaluates, however, that although domestic demand expansion has also been moderate, prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are favorable, with some asymmetry among the several sectors.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply both for individuals and corporate; and by the fact that consumers and businessmens confidence, stands at high levels.",
        "The Copom understands, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months, which started to retreat in the last quarter of last year, tends to continue the decline and, therefore, to move towards the targets path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic agents expectations, especially price setters, about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Additionally, the Committee understands that this improvement in the sentiment tends to be boosted by the ongoing process of moderation in the dynamic of producer prices and at wholesale markets.",
        "The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the reduction trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit market.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch, in specific segments, between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "However, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the 6 labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "The Copom considers that the deceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second half of 2011 was deeper than expected, that recent events indicate the postponement of a final solution for the European financial crisis, and that the risks related to the deleveraging process stemming from banks, families and government - under way in major economic blocks remain elevated.",
        "These and other elements, therefore, constitute an economic environment in which a much above-than-usual uncertainty level prevails.",
        "The Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, the inflation rate stands around the target in In short, the Copom considers that, at the present moment, the risks to the inflation trajectory remain limited.",
        "The Committee also notes that, until now, due to the global economys fragility, the external sector contribution has been disinflationary.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show robustness, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming semesters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, which are, in short, lagged and cumulative.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures.",
        "Another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the still fragile international scenario.",
        "These elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom understands that Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in the interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction of risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",

        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above, even considering that the activity recovery has occurred more slowly than anticipated, the Committee believes that, given the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented so far, any movement of additional monetary easing should be conducted with parsimony.",
        "The monthly result reflected the slowdown in market and regulated prices.",
        "The monthly IPCA change was mainly due to the increase in the groups of housing, food and beverages, and personal expenses, with respective contributions of 0.07 p.p., 0.06 pp and 0.05 pp, while education was the group most responsible for the deceleration of the index in March, with a contribution of 0.02 pp, down from 0.26 pp in February.",

        "Under this scenario of increase in risk aversion, the US dollar valued against the euro and the currencies of emerging countries exporters of commodities.",
        "This movement was influenced, at the local scenario, by the prospect of continuity of the monetary easing cycle and by the favorable trajectory of price indices.",
        "At the external scenario, the possibility of Europes debt crisis deepening, the release of weaker economic indicators in Europe, US and China and the retreat of the North American treasuries rates have also contributed to the reduction of the future rates.",

        "The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector moving from a position of neutrality to expansionism.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee notes that the fragile international scenario represents an important factor restraining aggregate demand.",
        "These elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal field and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom understands that the Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction of risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",
        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the 6 economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economys current solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above, considering the balance of risks to inflation, the domestic activity recovery and the complexity involved in the international environment, the Committee believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most appropriate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the target, even in a non-linear way.",
        "The monthly result reflected deceleration in market prices and acceleration in regulated prices.",
        "The monthly IPCA-15 change mainly stemmed from the increases in the prices of food and beverages, which contributed 0.20 p.p., and housing and transportation, both with identical contributions of 0.09 p.p..",
        "The IPC-10 change in November was mainly influenced by the lower increases in the prices of the food group, whose contribution dropped from 0.27 p.p.",
        "in October to 0.07 in November.",
        "The average tenure on reference credit operations increased thirteen days in October, reaching 522 days.",
        "The tenure related to individuals and corporate segments increased four and twenty-one days, respectively, reaching 620 and 432 days, in the order.",
        "In the US, the acceleration in growth reflected expansions in household consumption and in the 11 federal government expenditures, and additional improvements in the housing market, reflected in growth of housing prices, in the amount of new houses being built and in the building confidence index.",
        "In the Euro Area, which registered, in the third quarter, four straight consecutive quarters with no growth, the most recent indicators for industrial production, consumption, economic sentiment and unemployment rate, suggest the continuity of this scenario.",
        "In China, average monthly growth rates observed in the third quarter, compared to the previous quarter, indicated improvement in industrial production and retail sales and slowdown in fixed asset investment.",
        "In October, the three-month moving average for these same variables increased relative to September.",
        "In financial markets, the stock markets of major countries presented divergent trajectories, a fact that was repeated regarding the US dollar exchange rate against other currencies.",
        "In the month, there were no BCBs interventions in the domestic exchange rate spot market.",
        "During the period, discreet increase in the interest curve slope was observed, with retreat in the short-term rates and increase in the long-term part.",
        "Domestically, concerns with the impact of the dollar valuation against the BRL over future inflation, the possible increase in fuel prices and the reduction of electricity tariffs below expectations contributed to this movement.",
        "The rate for one-year maturity increased 0.03 p.p..",
        "The BCB also conducted very short-term operations through 32 borrowing operations, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of two working days.",
        "The main factors that contributed to the contraction of liquidity in the period were the net revenues of the Union and the net issuance of securities by the National Treasury.",
        "Underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB have performed similarly to headline inflation.",
        "The Copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective conditions of the demand and on the price setters' expectations regarding the future inflation path.",
        "In short, domestic demand, boosted by moderate expansion of credit, as well as by employment and income growth, has been the main factor sustaining activity.",
        "The production of fourteen of the 27 branches of activity decreased in May.",
        "The slower growth of the economically active population in the recent period, compared to the occupied population, has contributed to the maintenance of low unemployment rates, despite the moderation in the pace of job creation.",
        "In short, the set of available data indicates that, although the labor market remains robust, there are signs of moderation at the margin.",
        "This indicator provides important additional information, as it portrays the current outlook and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely manner.",
        "In June, the index evolved negatively, after recording consecutive improvements in the months of March, April and May.",
        "For the upcoming months, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth, by the high level of consumer confidence and by moderate credit expansion.",
        "Heightened risks to global financial stability remain due to the still high level of political uncertainty and to the difficulties of implementing the recently announced measures.",
        "High rates of unemployment for a long period, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, the limited scope for countercyclical policy actions and the political uncertainty are translated into projections of low growth for mature economies.",
        "Core inflation measures have remained at moderate levels in the US, in the Euro Area and in Japan.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, the monetary policy bias is expansionist, which combines, in some cases, with additional countercyclical policies.",
        "In particular, China promoted, in June and July, two consecutive cuts in the reference interest rates for deposits and loans.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "Prospectively, it is plausible to affirm that the reduction of growth targets in China, coupled with the fragility of the global economy, tends to generate downward pressures over commodities prices.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks, and their impacts, were reassessed according to the new set of available information.",
        "The set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last years.",
        "The main scenario does not include the occurrence of extreme events in international financial markets, and considers the estimates of the impacts caused by changes in the external environment on the Brazilian economy.",
        "For 2013, the inflation projection reduced in both scenarios, but still stands above the midpoint target in both cases.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longer-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premia, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and companies.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "In other words, high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment growth; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Committee understands that, overall, the prospects of more moderate global activity than previously anticipated have consolidated, and the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed little.",
        "It also notes that, in these economies, there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy actions, and a scenario of fiscal restraint also prevails, in this and in the upcoming years.",
        "Moreover, in important emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity has moderated, in part, as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external demand.",
        "In specific cases, changes in the growth pattern tend to be permanent.",
        "Therefore, until now, the Committee evaluates that the international scenario has shown disinflationary bias.",
        "For the Copom, there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy materializes through several channels, among others, moderation of total trade, moderation in investment flows and tighter credit conditions.",
        "Another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity.",
        "The Copom evaluates, however, that although domestic demand expansion has also been moderate, prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are favorable, with some asymmetry among the several sectors.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply both for individuals and corporate; and by the fact that consumers and, to a lesser extent, businessmens confidence, stands at high levels.",
        "The Committee understands, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months, which started to retreat in the last quarter of 2011, tends to continue the decline and, therefore, to move towards the targets path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic agents expectations, especially price setters, about the inflation dynamics in this and in the upcoming quarters.",
        "The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the reduction trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long terms.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit market.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch, in specific segments, between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "However, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "The Committee considers that the recovery in domestic economic activity has materialized quite gradually; on the other hand, it highlights that the main scenario encompasses more intense pace of activity this semester.",
        "The Committee identifies decrease in the probability of extreme events in international financial markets, but at the same time, it argues that recent developments indicate postponement of a final solution for the European financial crisis, and that risks associated to the process of deleveraging of banks, households and government - now under way in the main economic blocs remain high.",
        "These and other elements, therefore, 6 constitute an economic environment in which a much above-than-usual uncertainty level prevails.",
        "The Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, the inflation rate stands around the target in In short, the Copom considers that, at the present moment, the risks for the inflation trajectory remain limited.",
        "The Committee also notes that, until now, due to the global economys fragility, the external sector contribution has been disinflationary.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show robustness, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming semesters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, which are, in short, lagged and cumulative.",
        "The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate scenario of neutrality of the public sector balance sheet.",
        "The Committee notes that the still fragile international scenario presents itself as an important factor restraining aggregate demand.",
        "These elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",

        "In light of the above, even considering that the activity recovery has occurred more slowly than anticipated, the Committee believes that, given the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented so far, any additional monetary easing movement should be conducted with parsimony.",
        "The monthly result reflected deceleration in market and regulated prices.",
        "The transportation group was the main responsible for deceleration of the index in June, with a contribution of 0.24 p.p., compared to -0.12 p.p.",
        "The result, a record high for the month of June and the third record high for the historical series, reflected the tax cuts implemented by the federal government in the end of May.",
        "The monthly result stemmed from the reductions of 0.3 p.p.in durable consumer goods, 0.2 p.p.",
        "in construction inputs and capital goods, and 0.1 p.p.",
        "in intermediate goods, while non-durable consumer goods increased 0.6 p.p..",

        "In China, the deceleration trend for activity indicators has remained.",
        "The composed PMI showed further decline in June, mainly influenced by the performance of the manufacturing sector.",
        "In the financial markets, despite the environment of high uncertainty, there was reduction in risk aversion in the period.",
        "The relief in the markets favored the valuation of the euro and the currencies of emerging countries against the dollar, while the US and German ten-year securities yields increased relative to the record lows of May.",
        "Due to the deterioration in the global macroeconomic scenario, the central banks of major economies have opted for the adoption of new quantitative easing measures.",
        "In the month, there were no monetary authority's interventions in the domestic spot market.",
        "The fall in the rates in this period was influenced, at the local scenario, by the prospect of continuity of the monetary easing cycle, by the release of weaker economic indicators, by the favorable trajectory of price indices and by the decreases in inflation and GPD expectations released by the Focus survey.",
        "At the external scenario, the worsening of the economic indicators in Europe, in the US and in China, and the uncertainties stemming from the developments of the debts crisis that hits countries in the Euro Area have also contributed to the retreat of the rates.",
        "The rates for maturities of one, two and three years decreased by 0.67 p.p., 0.56 p.p.",
        "and 0.46 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB also conducted very short-term operations through 24 borrowing operations and four lending operations, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of two working days.",

        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premia, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and companies.",

        "Moreover, in important emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity remained moderate.",
        "For the Committee, this shock tends to be less intense and less lasting than the one observed in , as well as it tends to reverse in the medium term.",
        "Therefore, despite manifesting inflationary bias in the short term, the international scenario looks disinflationary in the medium term.",
        "For the Copom, there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy materializes through several channels, among others, moderation of total trade, moderation in investment flows and tighter credit conditions.",
        "Another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen confidence.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, although domestic demand expansion has moderated, prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are favorable, with some asymmetry among the several sectors.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and, to a lesser extent, businessmens confidence stands at high levels.",
        "The Committee understands, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months, which started to retreat in the last quarter of 2011, tends to move non-linearly towards the targets path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic agents expectations, especially price setters, about the inflation dynamics in this and in the upcoming semesters.",
        "The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the reduction trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long terms.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit market.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch, in specific segments, between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "However, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "The Committee also highlights risks stemming from the instability in the prices of in natura products and grains, which manifest, for example, in the dynamics of wholesale prices.",
        "The Committee considers that the recovery in domestic economic activity has materialized gradually; on the other hand, it highlights that the main scenario encompasses more intense pace of activity in this semester and next year.",
        "The Committee identifies decrease in the probability of extreme events in international financial markets, but, at the same time, it argues that the external environment remains complex, given the lack of a final solution for the European financial crisis, and the risks associated to the ongoing deleveraging process of banks, households and government - in the main economic blocks.",
        "Thus, the Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, inflation tends to move towards the target path.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show robustness, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and moderate credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming semesters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, which are, in short, lagged and cumulative.",
        "For the Committee, these effects, the programs of public services concession and the gradual recovery of confidence create good prospects for investment in this and in the upcoming semesters.",
        "The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate scenario of neutrality of the public sector results.",
        "The Committee also 6 notes that the fragile international scenario represents as an important factor restraining aggregate demand.",
        "These elements and quasi fiscal developments are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom understands that the Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in the interest rates in general and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction of risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",
        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economys current solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above, considering the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented until the moment, which in part reflect in the ongoing recovery of economic activity, the Copom understands that, if the prospective scenario justifies an additional adjustment in monetary conditions, this movement should be conducted with extreme parsimony.",
        "The monthly result reflected acceleration in market and regulated prices.",
        "The sales reached 364.2 thousand units, a record high for the month of July and the second record high for the historical series, reflecting the tax exemption implemented by the federal government in the end of May.",
        "Light commercial vehicles sales remained stable, according to this comparison basis.",
        "The monthly result stemmed from the expansions of 4.3 p.p.",

        "Among international commodities prices, it bears highlighting the increases in the prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and oil, the first three of which reflecting strong droughts in producer regions of the US and Russia, while the prices of oil suffer the impact, among other factors, of the economic embargo to Iran, of the maintenance of platforms in the North Sea and of the reduction in the US inventories.",
        "In the month, there were no monetary authority's interventions in the domestic spot market.",
        "The movement in the short part of the curve reflected, mainly, the prospect of continuity in the fall of the Selic rate and the uncertainties related to the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity.",
        "In the long part, the increase in the rates was influenced, at the domestic scenario, by the release of several current inflation indices above the expected and by the increase of inflation expectations.",
        "At the external scenario, the increase in the prices of agricultural commodities and the expectation of announcement of the new monetary stimuli measures by the Fed also contributed for the elevation of the long-term rates.",

        "For housing credits, despite the demand at levels higher than those observed from July to September 2012, the expected approval of new lines tends to be similar to the previous quarter.",
        "In particular, foreign sales to Argentina and to the European Union were negatively impacted.",

        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the 7 structure of the financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economys current solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committee's assessment, are largely permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above, considering the balance of risks to inflation, the recovery in domestic activity and the complexity involved in the international environment, the Committee believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most appropriate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the target, even in a non-linear way.",
        "The monthly result reflected acceleration both in market and in regulated prices.",
        "The monthly IPCA change mainly stemmed from the increases in the prices of food and beverages and housing, which contributed 0.30 p.p.",
        "and 0.10 p.p., respectively.",
        "All the use categories retracted, according to the same comparison basis, with highlights for the reductions of 1.5 p.p.",
        "in capital goods production, and of -0.6 p.p.",

        "The average tenure on reference credit operations increased three days in August, reaching 507 days.",
        "The tenure related to individuals and corporate segments increased four and two days, respectively, reaching 614 and 408 days, in the order.",
        "Average housing prices, measured by the Case-Shiller index, rose in July for the sixth consecutive month and recorded the first increase year-over-year in June.",
        "The composite PMI for the region reached 46.1 in September down from 46.3 in August, indicating contraction for the eighth consecutive month.",
        "In China, despite the maintenance of the slowdown in the year-over-year data, 12 the monthly average growth rates observed in the July-August period for industrial production and retail sales advanced in relation to the averages of the second quarter, in contrast to the observed for investments in fixed assets.",
        "Regarding the international commodities prices, it is worth mentioning the significant advance in the prices of metals, heavily influenced by the aforementioned measures.",
        "The agricultural commodities showed variations in opposite directions, with declines in the international prices of grains and increases in sugar and coffee prices.",
        "The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil, despite oscillating, declined during the analyzed period.",
        "In emerging and developing countries, disinflation also suffered inflection in August, driven largely by the increases in the prices of food and raw materials over the past few months.",
        "In the month, there were no BCBs interventions in the domestic exchange rate spot market.",
        "Domestically, the drop in interest rates was influenced by the release of data regarding formal employment and economic activity below market estimates and by expectations of continued monetary easing cycle.",
        "On the international scenario, concerns about the developments of the crisis in the Euro Area and the prospect of low global growth strengthened the downward movement of long-term rates.",
        "The rates for maturities of one, two and three years declined 0.23 p.p., 0.41 p.p.",
        "and 0.37 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB also conducted very short-term operations through 29 borrowing operations, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days.",
        "The main factors that contributed to the expansion of liquidity in the period were the net expenditures of the Union and the release of funds from compulsory deposits.",
        "In short, the set of available information suggests a declining trend of inflation on a twelvemonth accumulated basis, but some persistence of the high price hikes observed in 2011, which partially reflects the fact that services inflation remains at high levels.",
        "The decline in the index in December was driven by significant reduction in producer prices during the month.",
        "In general, the recent evolution of these indices indicates the reduction of the pressures stemming from wholesale prices over consumer prices.",
        "The moderation in the pace of growth was noticeable in all components of domestic demand, and resulted, in part, from the policy actions implemented since the end of 2010, intensified by the deterioration of the global economic scenario since the third quarter of last year.",
        "For micro, small and medium companies, the indicators show a scenario similar to the observed in the previous quarter, with supply moderately more restrictive and demand moderately stronger, but at levels below those observed the third quarter of Regarding credit to consumption, the outlook for this quarter basically points to stability in the percentage of credit approval, quarter-on-quarter.",
        "For housing loans, despite the more selective supply by the financial institutions, the expectation of increasing demand induces a scenario with the approval of new lines, in this quarter, moderately above than the figures observed in the previous quarter.",
        "Services and trade were the sectors that mostly contributed for formal employment increase in the month.",
        "In short, evidences indicate that although the labor market remains robust, there are signs of moderation at the margin.",
        "This indicator provides important additional information, as it portrays the current state and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely manner.",
        "The index continued to indicate slowdown in the sector in December, similarly to what occurred in the two previous months.",
        "In the upcoming months, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental transfers, by the pace of real payroll growth, by the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit expansion.",
        "Thus, capacity utilization stood 1.6 p.p.",
        "The rates of installed capacity utilization have been retreating, reflecting, in part, the reduction in the pace of production growth and the maturity of investments.",
        "Global economy continues to face a period of uncertainty above the usual, with deterioration in activity prospects and the possibility of occurrence of extreme events.",
        "The risks to global financial stability remain high, among others, due to exposure of international banks to sovereign debt of countries with fiscal imbalances, and high levels of risk aversion persist, despite a slight decrease at the margin.",
        "From another perspective, high persistent unemployment rates, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, as well as limited scope for monetary policy actions and political uncertainty, have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in mature countries or even of their potential growth, indicating wider and more volatile economic cycle.",
        "In specific cases, the probability of recession increased, especially in the Euro Area.",
        "There has also been continued reduction in growth projections for important emerging economies.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances and, in specific cases, non-conventional monetary policy initiatives.",
        "Regarding inflation, the core measures have persisted at moderate levels in the US and in the Euro Area.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, monetary policy bias is expansionist.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "In the recent past, the high volatility observed in the prices of commodities was strongly impacted by the abundant global liquidity, in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of growth and to volatility in FX markets.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available information.",
        "The set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the change in the IPCA weighting structure, which will take place in January The projections were developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that identify in a broader manner the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the Brazilian economy among others, trade, imports prices and external volatility channels.",
        "As a working hypothesis, the main scenario considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the Brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international crisis.",
        "For 2013, the inflation projection stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and above, in the market scenario.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premia, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and companies.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "In other words, high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment growth; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain high.",
        "It also notes that, in these economies, there seems to be limited scope for using monetary policy, and a scenario of fiscal restraint also prevails.",
        "In addition, for the main emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity has moderated, in part, as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external demand, through the external trade channel.",
        "Therefore, the Committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant horizon.",
        "For the Copom, there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy materializes through several channels, among others, the reduction of total trade, the moderation in investment flows, tighter credit conditions and the worsening in consumer and businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment add up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity, which is mirrored, for instance, in the retreat of growth projections for the Brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming year.",
        "In other words, the moderation process of the Brazilian economy was intensified by the weakness of the global economy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is observed, prospects for economic activity are favorable.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that, despite showing some cooling, point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers confidence, notwithstanding the accommodation at the margin, stands at historically high levels.",
        "The Copom considers, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months, which started to retreat in the last quarter, tends to continue the decline and, therefore, to move towards the targets path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that, by itself, the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic agents, especially those of the price setters, about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Additionally, the Committee believes that this improvement in the perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity pace, both domestic and external, in this and in the upcoming semesters.",
        "The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio reduction.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderation in credit market expansion.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the adoption of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch, in specific segments, between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "However, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market, despite the signs of moderation in this market, and considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the long-term trend, that is, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures.",
        "The Committee also observes that, in general, commodities prices in international markets have shown benign behavior.",
        "The Copom notes that, according to the main scenario, the inflation rate stands around the target in 2012, and identifies decreasing risks to the materialization of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint target.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic demand is still robust, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming quarters, when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of the monetary policy actions recently implemented, which, in short, are lagged and cumulative.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures.",
        "Another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial and persistent deterioration in the international scenario.",
        "These elements and the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Copom understands that the Brazilian economy has experienced significant structural changes, which determined retreat in the interest rates in general, and, in particular, in the neutral rate.",
        "Among the factors that support this view, it bears highlighting the reduction of risk premia, a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive year, of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional improvements.",
        "Moreover, the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital markets, by the credit market deepening, as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the 7 economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity.",
        "The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed for the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which are largely, according to the Committees assessment, permanent developments.",
        "In light of the above mentioned, and also considering that the deceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second semester of last year was deeper than anticipated, and that recent events indicate postponement of a definitive solution for the European financial crisis, at the present moment, the Copom attributes high probability for the materialization of a scenario that considers the decrease of the Selic target to one-digit levels.",

        "It should be highlighted that the appearance of signs pointing to consistent pressure over the availability of production factors, as suggested in some industrial surveys, indicates that possible reductions in industrial activity expansion could be associated to productive capacity restrictions.",
        "Labor market continues to present quite favorable performance.",
        "In line with the positive developments in labor market, and with credit expansion, retail sales continue to record positive performance, indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust, and signs of cooling cannot be perceived.",

        "Despite the dominant opinion still seems to point out to a transitory, but possibly intense deceleration, the negative assessments have become more disseminated.",
        "This assessment reflects, to some extent, uncertainties about the capacity of the monetary policy stance implemented by the central bank in the US, to which fiscal incentives will be added, to smooth in a timely manner the US economic weakening, in light of persistent difficulties in the financial system.",

        "On the other hand, strong economic growth in main Asian emerging economies, which so far have been apparently little affected by the US mortgage crisis, have offset the effects of economic deceleration in mature economies.",
        "In fact, pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging economies, many of which are in the midst of monetary tightening cycles.",
        "For mature economies, prospects for monetary policy are more diverse.",
        "Economies presenting more moderate inflationary pressures and more evident credit contraction tend to present additional monetary policy easing.",
        "On the other hand, in economies where inflation rates are above their respective targets, the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more limited.",
        "However, until this moment, Brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets confidence, and, despite not decoupled from external economic developments, Brazilian economy should sustain its growth trajectory, essentially driven by domestic demand.",

        "Even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since mid-2007, the Committee believes, according to newly available information, that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflation scenario.",
        "On the other hand, there are signs that relevant inflationary pressures are intensifying both in mature and emerging economies, evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global outlook.",
        "The Copom reaffirms the vision that, for the Brazilian inflation, an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration represents an ambiguous risk factor.",
        "On the one hand, reducing net exports would act as a factor to restrain aggregate demand.",
        "Moreover, the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the above-mentioned alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two mechanisms.",
        "In the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets center, risk aversion could increase, resulting in decreased demand for Brazilian assets and depreciation of their prices.",
        "In addition, in the medium run, a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain Brazilian assets.",
        "Therefore, although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets trajectory, additional uncertainties surround the inflation path, and the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario increased.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last years.",
        "The Copom considers that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory is relevant, because the heated demand and market of factors, in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some sectors, can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee understands that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price inflation, depend mostly on inflation expectations, which remain carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable sector, heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector, for instance, such as in the services sector.",
        "In this context, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Copom will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as inflation expectations within the forecast period, discriminating between one-off and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longlasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the continuity of the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last years.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators, in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, do not point to persistent imbalances.",
        "The Committee emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation.",
        "Activity level has not completely mirrored the remaining effects of the interest rates cuts implemented in 2007, as well as the effects of the economic activity on inflation have not completely materialized.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the mentioned factors that will sustain demand.",
        "Consequently, the lagged remaining effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute on a significant way to this expansion.",
        "These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of 2008 and later.",
        "The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "This factor, together with the external sector, has helped to mitigate inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be sustained, among other factors, by fiscal transfers and the remaining impulse stemming from the monetary policy easing implemented until September 2007, continues to present risks to inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand is even more relevant to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy stance.",
        "Aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable environment, the Copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary trajectory.",
        "This strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "That is the reason why variables such as inflation projections, the balance of risks associated to the forward-looking scenario and especially the preventive stance in the decision-making process of the Copom are so important.",
        "At the current moment, characterized by the deterioration in the balance of inflationary risks, prudence assumes an even more important role in this process.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of signals of economy heating and inflation expectations increase, despite short-term favorable developments, the risks for the concretization of a benign inflationary scenario, in which inflation would remain consistent with the targets path, as reflected in the projections, are relevant.",
        "Even considering that, at the moment, the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate decision, the Committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different monetary policy stance, in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets path.",
        "The Copom also considers that the persistence of the mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand tends to increase the probability of such scenario to materialize.",
        "In this context, the Copom analyzed the option of adjusting the Selic target rate at this moment.",
        "Such adjustment would contribute to reinforce the anchoring of expectations not only for 2008, but also in the mediumterm, and to reduce the mismatch between aggregate demand and supply trajectories.",
        "However, the prevailed understanding considered that, at this moment, the balance of risks to the central prospective inflation path would justify the maintenance of the basic rate at its current level.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom decides according to inflation prospects, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its projections.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand vigorously, backing-up economic activity dynamism, including sectors little exposed to external competition, at a time when the effects of important incentive factors, such as the monetary easing already implemented, are still not fully perceived.",
        "On its turn, the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary scenario, in light of robust domestic demand growth, seems to become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate.",
        "In such environment, the monetary authority must remain vigilant to avoid that short-term uncertainties contaminate longer time horizons.",
        "If the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario, the Committee will promptly adjust monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "The seasonal influence of education in the IPCA-15 change in February accelerated the monthly change of the core inflation excluding household food and regulated prices.",
        "The trimmed means cores changes remained stable in the month and accelerated in twelve months.",
        "Among the index components, wholesale and consumer prices decelerated month-on-month.",
        "The reduction in the IPA-M inflation rate in February reflected the behavior of agricultural prices, and the industrial prices inflation was almost unchanged relative to the previous month.",
        "The positive results of retail sales evidenced the payroll increase, favorable credit conditions, the impacts of assistance programs and the agricultural sector recovery.",
        "This decrease should be considered as punctual, and does not implicate in inflexion of industrial activity growth.",
        "These indicators show the continuation of favorable expectations of businessmen for the near future.",
        "According to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, 142.9 thousand new formal jobs were created in January 2008, a record high for the month.",
        "The elevation reflected a seasonal pattern, as the number of employed workers usually declines in January, due to the dismissal of workers temporarily employed at the end of the year, mainly in commerce.",
        "Additionally, due to the favorable economic conditions, the number of unemployed workers seeking for jobs in January increased, expanding the PEA.",

        "The deceleration in the US economy, the financial and capital markets swings and the effects of commodities prices rises increased the risk of deceleration in global economy.",
        "The US economic conditions, which indicated economic activity deceleration until the end of 2007, started to suggest the possibility of output contraction in the first quarter of 2008, driven by economic forecasts contaminated with risks stemming from the real estate sector, the labor and credit markets.",
        "The Fed recognized that, although the interbank market functioning has improved, there are relevant difficulties in other markets, and credit conditions became more restrictive, in general.",
        "One cannot discard that the current US economic situation can generate new rises in delinquency in US financial institutions, increasing the restrictions to credit concessions and additionally weakening economic activity.",
        "GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2007 recorded deceleration in the Euro Area and growth in Japan, although recent indicators signaled economic cooling in the latter.",
        "Even if activity decelerates to some extent, the emerging economies continued to grow in the last quarter of last year, with prospects of expansion in At the start of the year, increases in the prices of commodities, especially oil, have been key drivers of inflationary pressures and a delicate economic outlook.",
        "Inflation indicators did not show any cooling, which would provide central banks scope for the monetary easing necessary to combat the worsening of the financial crises and its spillovers effects on real economy.",

        "Similarly to headline inflation, the three IPCA core inflation measures trended upwards in December.",
        "It bears emphasizing that year-over-year headline inflation acceleration in 2007 was followed by two of the three core inflation measures.",
        "On a twelve-month trailing basis, despite remaining below the central target, all inflation core measures accelerated in December, compared to November, standing at levels remarkably higher than the record lows reached in previous months.",
        "For December, the effects of end-year celebrations can result in a new retreat in the month-on-month industrial production.",
        "However, the trend for the start of 2008 points to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, which will continue to be favored by the several incentive factors that influence economic activity, such as employment and credit expansion, the monetary easing already implemented, the fiscal impulse and, in some sectors, the recovery of reduced inventory levels.",
        "The solid expansion of capital goods production is, to a large extension, due to the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of domestic demand growth, which has reflected both the improvement of income and the expansion of credit, underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability consolidation.",
        "On its turn, the dynamism of durable consumer goods production reflects, predominantly, the remarkable improvement in credit conditions, when compared to historical patterns.",
        "It should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to consistent pressure over the availability of production factors, as suggested in some industrial surveys, indicates that possible reductions in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be associated to productive capacity restrictions.",
        "Labor market continues to present quite favorable performance.",
        "It is worth noticing that the unemployment rate in November reached a record low for the series, started in March 2002, both for the observed and for seasonally adjusted series.",
        "In line with the positive developments in labor market, and with credit expansion, retail sales continue to record positive performance, indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust, and signs of cooling cannot be perceived.",
        "The steady growth of retail sales in the year reflects the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions.",
        "For the next quarters, the continuity of the current expanding cycle is expected, and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income growth, credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high levels.",

        "The reduction of idle capacity occurs in several sectors, despite the significant increase of investment.",
        "The most recent data indicate that although investment has been contributing to soften the trend of increasing capacity utilization rates, it has not been sufficient to stop this process.",
        "Considering the recent behavior of capacity utilization rates, the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to avoid relevant mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary policy.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The trade balance continued to present robust performance in 2007, despite the expected deceleration at the margin, in line with the evaluations present in Inflation Reports and previous Copom Minutes about important structural changes in the Brazilian foreign trade.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, economic deceleration becomes more effective in the US, although high uncertainties still remain, particularly concerning its magnitude and duration.",
        "Despite encouraging Q3 2007 US GDP figures, more recent data, particularly on labor market and consumption, as well as confidence indices and other leading indicators, point to significant slowdown.",
        "Although uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the US subprime mortgages market crisis over US and European financial institutions and, consequently, over credit conditions for households and corporate, the dominant opinion points out to a transitory deceleration.",
        "This assessment reflects, to some extent, the expectation that the monetary policy stance implemented in the US, to which fiscal incentives can be added, will smooth the US economic weakening.",
        "Prospects for economic growth in Europe and Japan have also deteriorated, despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the US economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, strong economic growth in main Asian emerging economies, which so far have been apparently little affected by the US mortgage crisis, have offset the effects of economic deceleration in mature economies.",
        "In fact, pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures and tight monetary cycles in many emerging economies.",
        "For mature economies, prospects for monetary policy are more diverse.",
        "Economies presenting more moderate inflationary pressures concerns and more evident credit contraction tend to present additional monetary policy easing.",
        "On the other hand, in economies where inflation rates are above their respective targets, the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more limited.",
        "However, Brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets confidence, and although not decoupled from external economic developments, should sustain its growth trajectory, essentially driven by domestic demand.",
        "Oil prices, a systematic source of international uncertainty, remained at historically high levels, despite below the record high observed at the start of 2008, and also continued highly volatile.",
        "This behavior reflects, in addition to structural changes in global energy markets, recurrent geopolitical tensions.",
        "Despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil prices, the main scenario considered by the Copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in 2008, as observed in However, apart from the trajectory of domestic gasoline prices, one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts the domestic economy, both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as by the deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, using a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and 180-day swap rates, estimates a 48bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008, under the benchmark scenario.",

        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continues quite robust, being responsible at least partially for the inflationary pressures observed in the short-run, despite the imports growth and the benign investment behavior.",
        "Even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since mid-2007, the Committee believes that the prospects for Brazilian external financing in the forecast period suggest, according to newly available information, that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflation scenario.",
        "On the other hand, relevant inflationary pressures continue to be present both in mature and emerging economies, evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global outlook.",
        "The Copom reaffirms the vision that, for the Brazilian inflation, an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration would cause a risk factor of ambiguous signal.",
        "On the one hand, decreasing net exports would act as a factor to restrain aggregate demand.",
        "Moreover, the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the above-mentioned alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two mechanisms.",
        "In the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets center, risk aversion could increase, resulting in decreased demand for Brazilian assets and depreciation of their prices.",
        "Moreover, in the medium run, a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain Brazilian assets.",
        "Therefore, although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets trajectory, additional uncertainties surround the inflation path, and the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario increased.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last years.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand and market of factors, in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some sectors, can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee understands that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price inflation, depend mostly on inflation expectations, which remain carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable sector, the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector, for instance, such as in the services sector.",

        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators, in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, do not point to persistent imbalances.",
        "The Committee emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation.",
        "In the monetary easing cycle, started in September 2005, the Selic rate has already been reduced by 850 b.p., with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine months.",
        "Consequently, neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts yet, nor have the effects of economic activity on inflation completely materialized.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next quarters.",
        "Consequently, the lagged remaining effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute on a significant way to this expansion.",
        "These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of 2008 and later.",
        "The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "This factor, together with the external sector, has helped to mitigate inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be sustained, among other factors, by the remaining impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented until September 2007, continues to present risks to inflationary dynamics.",

        "In the period between the December and January Copom meetings, the future interest rates increased, especially in medium and longer terms.",
        "This movement was driven by the release of above-than-expected data for inflation and activity; the increase of inflation expectations; as well as the non-prorrogation of CPMF, which created uncertainties regarding the fulfillment of the fiscal targets.",
        "In the external scenario, significant losses of financial institutions, still related to the US subprime mortgage market crisis and the increasing concern of recession in the US economy, despite the release of incentive fiscal measures, provoked strong falls in the stock markets and heightened risk aversion.",

        "However, apart from the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts domestic economy both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, using a Vector Autoregressive model based on the 360-day swap rates replacing the model based on the Selic and 180-day swap rates, estimates a 83bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008, under the benchmark scenario.",
        "The swap rate trajectory points to a 55bps spread in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continues quite robust, showing acceleration in some segments and regions in the first quarter of 2008, and is responsible, at least partially, for the inflationary pressures observed in the short-run, despite strong imports growth and the benign investment behavior.",
        "Even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since mid-2007, the Committee believes, according to available information, that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflationary scenario.",
        "On the other hand, there are signs that relevant inflationary pressures are intensifying both in mature and emerging economies, evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global outlook.",
        "The Copom reaffirms the view, stated in previous minutes, that an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration represents an ambiguous risk factor for the Brazilian inflation.",
        "On the one hand, by reducing net exports it would act as a factor to restrain aggregate demand.",
        "Moreover, the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the above-mentioned alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two mechanisms.",
        "In the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets center, risk aversion could increase, resulting in decreased demand for Brazilian assets and depreciation of their prices.",
        "In addition, in the medium run, a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain Brazilian assets.",
        "Due to the deterioration of inflation prospects, in a more uncertain scenario, the Committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario increased.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last years.",
        "Particularly, monetary policy should act so that impacts initially focused on price indices do not result in persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics through a worsening in expectations.",
        "The Copom considers that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand and market of factors, in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some sectors, can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee understands that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price inflation, depend in a critical manner on inflation expectations, which increased significantly in the recent weeks, and continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable sector, heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector, for instance, such as in the services sector.",
        "In this context, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Copom will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as inflation expectations within the forecast period, promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario where one-off adjustments become persistent or generalized price increases.",
        "The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longlasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the continuous progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last years.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators, in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, converge during the relevant time for monetary policy.",
        "The Committee emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain demand.",
        "These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of 2008 and in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "This factor, together with the external sector, has helped to mitigate inflationary pressures, which would be even more intense in their absence.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be sustained, among other factors, by fiscal transfers and by income and credit growth, continues to present risks to inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand is even more relevant to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy stance.",
        "Aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable environment, the Copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary trajectory.",
        "This strategy takes into consideration the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and has proved to be the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "That is the reason why variables such as inflation projections, the balance of risks associated to the forward-looking scenario and especially the preventive stance in the decision-making process of the Copom are so important.",
        "At the current moment, characterized by the deterioration in current and expected inflationary dynamics, prudence assumes an even more important role in this process.",
        "In the current circumstances, there is the risk is that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become persistent, which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary policy.",
        "Therefore, the Copoms assessment, backed by international experience, is that the performance of monetary policy tends to be more effective to reach their goals more quickly, when the deterioration of inflationary dynamics is in its early stages, rather than when it is consolidated.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of signals of economy heating, as illustrated by the acceleration of some wholesale prices and the evolution of core inflation measures, and by the fast increase in inflation expectations, the risks for the concretization of a benign inflationary scenario, in which IPCA would remain consistent with the targets path, are relevant.",
        "In fact, the deterioration of the forward-looking scenario is already present in the Committees inflation projections.",
        "The Copom also considers that the persistence of the mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand tends to increase the probability of such scenario to materialize.",
        "In these circumstances, monetary policy should act through the adjustment of the basic interest rate in order to, on the one hand, contribute to the convergence between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand, and on the other hand, avoid that inflationary pressures initially focused on price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation forward-looking scenario.",
        "By remaining ready to act as the balance of risks to inflation dynamics so requests, the Committee believes that it is, in fact, helping to sustain economic growth, which requires stability, predictability and consequent extension of the planning horizon for businesses and families, as well as to protect the substantial increases in real income of workers observed in recent years.",
        "The Committee understands that the decision to promptly implement significant part of the adjustment in the basic interest rate will contribute to the timely reduction in the risks for the inflation scenario, reducing, therefore, the magnitude of the total adjustment to be implemented.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom decides according to inflation prospects, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its projections.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand vigorously, backing-up economic activity dynamism, including sectors little exposed to external competition, at a time when the effects of important incentive factors are still perceived.",
        "On its turn, the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary scenario, in light of robust domestic demand growth, seems to become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate.",
        "In such environment, the monetary authority should act so that to avoid that short-term uncertainties contaminate longer time horizons.",
        "If the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario, the Committee will promptly adjust monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "Trimmed means core inflation measures accelerated and, for seasonal reasons, the core excluding household food and regulated prices decelerated in March, while on a twelve-month trailing basis the three measures increased, compared to February.",

        "At the wholesale level, both agricultural and industrial prices increased in March, highlighting the elevations in the prices of tomato, composed fertilizers, bovines, iron ore, in natura milk, while soybean, manioc, coffee, corn and poultry were the main negative drivers.",

        "Imports, both in value and in daily average terms reached record highs for the month.",
        "This movement was mainly driven by the economic agents perception about the March Copom Minutes and the Quarterly Inflation Report, the release data for inflation above market expectations, the increase of inflation expectations and the worsening of the external outlook.",
        "Moreover, one-, two- and three-year rates increased by 95 bps, 88 bps and 90 bps, respectively.",
        "In the same period, the BCB conducted 30 overnight repoborrowing operations.",
        "The BCB also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working days.",
        "The scenario of solid expansion of capital goods production observed since 2007, mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic growth, underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability consolidation, seems to persist in this year.",
        "On its turn, the dynamism of durable consumer goods production reflects, predominantly, the remarkable improvement in credit conditions, when compared to historical patterns.",
        "It should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors, as suggested in some industrial surveys, indicates that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions.",

        "In line with the positive developments in the labor market and with the credit expansion, retail sales continue to record positive performance, indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust, and signs of cooling cannot be perceived.",
        "The steady growth of retail sales has reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions.",
        "For the next quarters, the continuity of the current cycle of retail sales expansion is expected, and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income growth, credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high levels.",
        "Sector indicators, for example, relative to automobile sales in April and May, corroborate this assessment.",
        "The maintenance of high installed capacity utilization rates, with some reduction of idle capacity at the margin, occurs in several sectors despite the significant increase in investment.",
        "Recent data indicate that, although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization rates, it has not been sufficient to contain this process.",
        "In this context, the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to limit mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary policy.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",

        "Even if the influence of monetary and fiscal stimulus can reduce the risk of a significant contraction in activity, the dominant scenario seems to point to a more consistent recover only from Even after significant strengthening of capital basis of relevant financial institutions, uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the US subprime mortgages market crisis over US and European banking system and over credit conditions for households and corporate.",
        "Therefore, uncertainties persist about the capability of monetary and fiscal policy measures implemented by the US authorities to smooth the weakening of the US economy in a timely manner, in light of the ongoing difficulties of the financial system.",
        "Despite the reduction of systemic risk perception, since mid-March, such difficulties could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in the quality of credit, which would reinforce the already evident trend to financial contraction, increasing the risk of slowdown intensification.",
        "Prospects for economic activity in Europe and Japan, in spite of some favorable indicators in Germany, have also deteriorated, despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the US economic activity.",
        "It should be highlighted that despite the prospects of continuity of slowdown for mature economies, global inflationary pressures have intensified.",
        "This has partially reflected strong economic growth in many emerging economies, which so far have been apparently little affected by the US mortgage crisis, offsetting the effects of economic deceleration in mature economies.",
        "In fact, in light of pressures over production factors availability, which have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging economies, the trend seems to point to the continuity of monetary tightening cycles.",
        "For mature economies, prospects for monetary policy are more diverse, notwithstanding the fact that inflation acceleration, which in some cases starts to deteriorate mid-term inflation expectations, seems to limit the scope for additional monetary policy easing, even if the risks to activity stemming from the credit crisis remain.",

        "Labor market continues to present favorable performance, but with signs of accommodation in the generation of formal employment.",
        "As a result, the average unemployment rate in the first ten months of the year was 1.6 p.p.",
        "In October and November, expanded retail sales data should evidence the effects of credit supply restrictions and the deterioration of consumer confidence over vehicle sales, already captured by the data from the National Federation of Distribution of Automotive Vehicles Fenabrave for these months.",
        "The steady growth of retail sales had been reflecting, in short, the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be favored by fiscal transfers, as well as by employment and income growth, but it will also be affected, in case of persistence, by the changes in the access to credit supply, and by the deterioration of consumer confidence.",
        "Without the seasonal adjustment, the Nuci stood 0.1 p.p.",
        "above the level registered in October 2007, a record high for the series.",
        "For the capital goods sector, the Nuci showed stability compared to the level observed in November 2007 while for the production of civil construction inputs the Nuci presented a 1.9 p.p.",
        "The reduction on Nuci calculated by FGV seems to be a result of a combination between investment projects maturity with softening on economic activity, which should point to a start of less pressure over the idle capacity level.",
        "Although not widespread, evidences so far suggest to an ongoing process of reduction in the mismatches regarding the evolution of supply and domestic demand.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, an already anticipated trend, and which is in line with assessments present in previous Inflation Reports and Copom Minutes.",
        "The reversal on the strengthening trend of the BRL and the softening on the pace of expansion of domestic demand may contribute to a recover on the trade surplus, notwithstanding the reduction on price levels of exports acting on the opposite direction.",
        "The increased risk aversion, observed since mid-September, after the bankruptcy of an important US financial institution, led the authorities in the US, Europe and Oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial systems, using wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money markets.",
        "Although systemic risk perception has showed moderation, pressures on the functioning of the interbank markets came back resulting from the nearness of the end of the year and the closing of the balance sheets of financial institutions.",
        "The international liquidity contraction has been contributing to a deleverage process by asset managers, which in turn has been pressuring down the prices of financial assets.",
        "In an environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital flows, pressures on emerging economies currencies have been kept.",
        "Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, at least in the short term the contraction trends prevail over the inflationary pressures.",
        "The dominant view still points to the expansion, at a modest pace, of global economic activity in 2009, but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature economies and also in some emerging economies.",
        "There are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in Europe and parts of Asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices, which could be reversing.",
        "On the other hand, the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in credit quality, which may reinforce the contraction in financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of intensification of deceleration.",
        "The US economy, in particular, entered into recession at the end of 2007 and still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector crisis, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial assets, has affected the consumers confidence, significantly contributing for depressing expenditure.",
        "The prevailing interpretation is that the activity in Europe and Japan may continue to lose dynamism in the next months.",
        "In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating considerably, inflationary pressures have reduced fast.",
        "On the other hand, in emerging economies, where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more intense, the inflationary pressures have been more persistent.",
        "In this context, the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature economies, whereas in emerging economies, which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation trend, in addition to the facts already mentioned, the reaction seems to be more heterogeneous.",
        "It is worth pointing that, particularly in mature economies, the authorities are announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining the economic activity, particularly through fiscal incentives, which could contribute to a gradual economic recovery.",
        "Future markets have followed, in general, the prices of oil in the spot market.",
        "However, uncertainty concerning oil prices is remarkably high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the supplys reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative prices, in addition to geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil prices trajectory, the main scenario adopted by the Copom, which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in 2008, remains plausible but with the persistence of the current framework of the oil market, it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis that price reductions for oil can occur in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the reduction of international oil prices can affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continued quite robust until the third quarter, and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration trend, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance in line with assessments present in previous Copom Minutes.",
        "Additionally, the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets impose adjustments in the balance of payments which, despite the increase in Brazilian economy external resilience, can increase the inflationary pressures, especially in the short run.",
        "In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects, which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant uncertainties.",
        "On the one hand, more generalized deceleration of global economic activity in the upcoming quarters points to a cooling of both commodities prices and external demand, therefore influencing negatively the local financial conditions.",
        "On the other hand, the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets, and consequently, depreciating their prices.",
        "Moreover, the recent trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of inflationary external pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in emerging economies, with important implications on domestic inflationary trajectory.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario retreated when compared to the risk prevailing months ago, but is still relevant.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years.",
        "Particularly, monetary policy should act to avoid that the deterioration of inflation dynamics observed in 2008 become persistent.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory could be lowering.",
        "The evidences of cooling of domestic demand, and more incipient, of accommodation of pressures on the market of factors, despite under uncertainty, may mitigate the pass- through of wholesale prices pressures to consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the materialization of this pass-through and the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer prices depend critically on inflation expectations, which still remain in levels above the inflation targets path and continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth pointing that, according to recent data and the indicators available so far, the heating of domestic demand was still pressuring the prices of non-tradable items, as services.",
        "In this context, the Copom will act to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "The maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance is essential to increase the probability that inflation in Brazil evolve once again according to the targets path in For this higher probability to continue to materialize, however, it is necessary that forward-looking inflation indicators, particularly the expected dynamics of aggregate supply and demand, converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "This viewpoint is even more important in periods of higher uncertainty.",
        "In particular, the effects of the international crisis on the domestic financial conditions indicate that the contribution of credit to support domestic demand may decline more intensively and, possibly, more persistently than the magnitude of what would happen exclusively by the monetary policy lagged effects.",
        "Additionally, the intensification of international crisis has caused a negative effect on consumers and businesses confidence.",
        "If this situation persists, the strength of economic activity would increasingly depend on real payroll expansion and the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in The Copom highlights the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "Moreover, it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities prices could contribute to restrain inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that, particularly in the short run, the main risk to the inflationary dynamics derives from the trajectory of Brazilian asset prices, in a process of decreasing external funding.",
        "In this context, the pace of reduction of the mismatch between the growth of aggregate demand and supply of goods and services, relevant up to the third quarter, continues to be crucial to the assessment of different possibilities for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk premia, to shorter planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, in the current circumstances, there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability to the fact that inflation acceleration become persistent, reducing the efficacy of monetary policy.",
        "On the other hand, the shortage of financing conditions in the economy amplifies monetary policy effects, contributing to promote inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "This strategy, which will have its results evidenced throughout time, takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "Indeed, prospective scenario evolution has started to reflect on inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "The Copom also understands that the probability of persistence of mismatch between growth pace of aggregate supply and demand, that continues to represent risk for inflation dynamics, has diminished.",
        "Under these circumstances, monetary policy should be cautiously conducted, aiming to assure inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "The Copom believes that the consolidation of restrictive financial conditions for a longer period could significantly intensify monetary policy effects over demand and, throughout time, over inflation.",
        "Under these circumstances, the majority of the Committee members, taking into account the balance of risks for economic activity, and therefore for the inflation scenario in 2009, debated the possibility of a 25 bps reduction of the Selic rate.",
        "However, the understanding that inflation central prospective path would still justify the maintenance of the Selic rate unchanged has prevailed.",
        "Other Copom members considered that the still remaining risks for inflationary dynamics, resulting from the possible persistence of inflation increases in 2008 and consequences of the adjusting process of balance of payments are still predominantly conditioning the various alternatives for monetary policy.",
        "The Copom will closely monitor the prospective scenario evolution for inflation in order to timely define the next steps for its monetary policy strategy.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to the projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking prices dynamics and the balance of risks associated to their projections.",
        "There are signs that domestic demand expansion rhythm, which remained expanding at high rates in the third quarter, would be currently contributing less intensely for the economic activity dynamics, in spite of persistence of stimulus factors such as income growth influencing the economy.",
        "On the other hand, the contribution of the external sector to a favorable inflationary scenario, in light of the strong depreciation in the prices of Brazilian assets and the apparent reduction in the countrys capacity to import, has become less effective.",
        "In such environment, the monetary policy should act so to bring inflation back to the targets path already in 2009, in order to avoid that the higher uncertainty detected in shorter-term horizons disseminate to longer-term periods, thus favoring a sustained recovery of economic activity.",
        "Still according to the FGV, businessmen confidence declined in November, as in October.",
        "The index reached the lowest level since July 2003 and fell below 100 points, indicating expectations of declining industrial activity.",
        "Considering use categories, all indicators stood below 100 points.",
        "Consumer goods, that registered the higher confidence level in the observed series, 90.1 points, had a 46 points reduction in comparison to November In the same comparison basis, construction material had the smallest fall, 33.1 points, while capital goods registered the biggest one, 51.9 points, leveling at 76.3 points.",
        "Considering industrial segments, pharmaceuticals and textiles, should be highlighted in the same comparison bases, with 2.8 p.p.",
        "The relative stability of the unemployment rate in September and October, in the observed series, reflected the 143 thousand people growth in the PEA and 176 thousand new jobs.",
        "In October, the PME survey shows that the aggravation of the international crisis did not affect yet the labor market in the countrys main metropolitan areas.",
        "In a first moment, the adjustment should happen through the reduction of work shifts and adoption of collective vacations, impacting real earnings, while layoffs will become an option if the crisis lasts for a longer period.",
        "External Environment Global economy and particularly, advanced countries face severe deceleration, and there are clear evidences of recession in many of these countries.",
        "Overall, forecasts for 2009 show contractions of both real GDP growth and inflation indexes.",
        "Global financial crisis has affected both consumer and businessmen confidences.",
        "Data from previous weeks have shown that businessmen confidence has suffered sharply deterioration in many countries.",
        "This situation reflects particularly a generalized decrease in services and manufacturing PMIs recently published.",
        "It is also evident in emerging economies, where the levels of businessmen and consumer confidence have also fallen sharply, giving additional evidences that these countries will suffer the impact of the recession that hits the developed economies.",
        "In the fourth quarter of 2008, global demand retraction sharpened, installed capacity utilization lowered and unemployment increased.",
        "In the other developed economies, labor market conditions also show deterioration.",
        "Price behavior confirms the trend of disinflation started in the third quarter of this year.",
        "This pattern is more evident in economies that present lower level of activity and quicker falls in commodities prices, particularly reflecting the sharp reduction in oil prices.",
        "In the United States, this pattern is reinforced by the dollar appreciation.",
        "However, in some emerging countries, exchange-rate depreciation prevents further price reductions and limits the actions of their central banks.",
        "In this context, the majority of central banks started or intensified monetary easing procedures, based not only on the broadening of the risks of recession, but also on fears of deflation.",
        "In emerging economies from Southeast Asia, that are more dependent upon exports, local central banks have performed cuts in their policy rates in an attempt to mitigate the impact that the negative expectations about the worldwide economy have over their local industrial production.",
        "The deterioration in global macroeconomic conditions may increase the number of emerging countries to perform rate cuts in the near future.",
        "Money Market and Open Market Operations Immediately after the last Copom decision in October, the future yield curve experienced an upward parallel shifting.",
        "The interruption of the tightening monetary cycle and the expectation of a higher inflation in the near term were decisive factors for this movement.",
        "From November on, however, the behavior of the yield curve changed and the interest rates began to show a falling trajectory, mainly influenced by the release of both inflation data below market expectations, and economic data showing a retreat in the economic activity level.",
        "In the beginning of December, the fall in interest rates became more intense especially in the long-term segment.",
        "Between October 27 and December 8, one-, three-, and six-month rates decreased by 50 bps, 78 bps and 168 bps, respectively.",
        "Moreover, one-, two- and three-year rates decreased by 299 bps, 376 bps, and 430 bps, respectively.",
        "In the same period, the BCB borrowed money through 32 overnight repo operations.",
        "The BCB also conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day-tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "The three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB have evolved in line with the headline index, notwithstanding the non-uniform characteristic.",
        "On the other hand, the smoothed and non-smoothed trimmed means core inflation have shown relative stability, under this criterion, in the last months.",
        "As a consequence, all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the IPCA diffusion index, whose average is the highest recorded since 2004, continues to suggest dissemination of the inflationary process, confirming the analysis present in previous Copom Minutes.",
        "It also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial prices, a process that began in the second half of 2007 and does not show consistent signs of accommodation.",
        "The data already released for the last months point, in short, to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, despite some accommodation at the margin may occur, due to restrictions to supply expansion in some sectors, as well as to the effects of the monetary policy change in Brazil and to the deceleration of external demand.",
        "The recovery of the capital goods production in June and July more than offset the strong fall occurred in May, evidencing the strength of this segment, which has been mainly a result of the consolidation of favorable prospects for the continuity of macroeconomic stability.",
        "On its turn, the expansion of durable goods production reflects, predominantly, credit conditions, which remain more favorable than historical patterns.",
        "Labor market continues to present quite favorable performance.",
        "In addition to the process of formalization in the labor market, these data evidence the strong dynamism in labor force demand.",
        "In line with the positive developments in the labor market and with credit expansion, retail sales still continue to record positive performance, indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust, and signs of cooling cannot be perceived.",
        "The steady growth of retail sales has, therefore, reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions.",
        "For the next quarters, the continuity of the current expansion cycle of retail sales is expected, favored by the increase in fiscal transfers, employment and income growth, credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high levels.",
        "Notwithstanding, as time goes by, the change in the monetary policy stance will be relevant to restrain the retail sales expansion pace.",
        "The maintenance of installed capacity utilization rates at historically high levels occurs in several sectors despite investments occurred in the sector in the last twelve months.",
        "In fact, recent data about the absorption of capital goods still dont allow the conclusion of inflexion in the investment expansion trend.",
        "In short, evidences suggest that, although investment has been importantly contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization rates, the maturation of investment projects has not been sufficient, so far, to significantly limit the existing mismatches regarding the evolution of supply and domestic demand.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, a trend that has already been expected, and which is in line with assessments present in Inflation Reports and previous Copom Minutes.",
        "As highlighted in previous Copom Minutes, imports have been growing faster than exports, both due to the strengthening of the BRL and to the robust expansion of domestic absorption, notwithstanding the elevated price levels of several commodities included in the Brazilian export basket.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, the global economy still shows divergent pressures, with more evident signs of deceleration and still high inflation rates.",
        "The prevailing interpretation still points to the expansion, at a moderate pace, of economic activity in 2008 and 2009, but data released in the last few weeks indicate a more intense cooling of activity in mature economies, mainly in the Euro area, the United Kingdom and Japan, while signs of economic activity deterioration also appeared in the US, despite the fiscal and monetary stimuli previously adopted.",
        "The secondary effects derived from the increase in raw materials prices, and the pressures of heated demand over supply expansion capability, which are particularly evident in emerging economies, have sustained current inflation rates at high levels, with significant consequences, in several cases, over inflation expectations.",
        "Furthermore, a severe financial crisis in the USA and, to a minor extent, in Europe, must be added to this adverse scenario.",
        "In this context, although the presence of inflationary pressures has been a concern for an important number of monetary authorities, their policy reactions have been heterogeneous, and this situation tends to persist.",
        "The US economy, specifically, started to decelerate in the last quarter of 2007 and it still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector crisis, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, together with the increase in the prices of oil by-products, has reduced consumers confidence, significantly contributing for depressing expenditure.",
        "Although fiscal and monetary stimuli have limited the risks of a deeper activity contraction, the dominant expectation still indicates a more consistent recovery only from 2009 on.",
        "Even after an important reinforcement of the capital base of significant financial institutions, uncertainties about the extension and length of the US mortgage crisis developments over the local and European banking systems still prevail, as well as about the impacts over the credit availability for business and households in those regions.",
        "Systemic risk perception is still high, as financial problems have aggravated due to a cyclical deterioration in credit quality, which tends to tighten financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of more intense economic deceleration.",
        "In this context, US government intervention in large mortgage companies can be seen as a necessary condition, although probably insufficient to overcome such crisis.",
        "Most common opinion among analysts indicates that activity in Europe and Japan should decelerate throughout the second half of In developed economies, therefore, prospects for the adoption of tightening policies seem limited; on the other hand, although showing some moderation at the margin, emerging countries growth remains strong and, up to now, was apparently little affected by the mortgage crisis in the US, partially counterbalancing the activity deceleration in mature economies.",
        "In fact, due to the pressure over the availability of production factors, the inflation elevation pointed to the maintenance of monetary tightening policies in several emerging economies.",
        "Nevertheless, policies aiming at the reduction of external vulnerability of Brazilian economy have been successful, contributing to reduce, though not eliminate, the effects of the external environment on local economic activity, which has been driven essentially by domestic demand.",
        "Future markets and the consensus among analysts suggest that oil prices could stabilize around current levels.",
        "However, uncertainty concerning these evaluations is remarkably high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the supplys reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative prices, besides geopolitical issues that affect oil prices.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the great uncertainty regarding oil prices trajectory, the main scenario adopted by the Copom, which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in 2008, remains plausible.",
        "However, it bears highlighting that, no matter the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, international oil prices at historically high levels affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as by the deterioration they may cause on economic agents inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, on the benchmark scenario, based on the 360day swap rates estimates a 173 bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 106 bps in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite robust, and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration observed since the end of 2007, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance.",
        "In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects and surrounded by significant uncertainties.",
        "On the one hand, the prospects of more pronounced deceleration of global activity in the upcoming months, which are apparently consolidating, point to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external demand, and can also influence local financial conditions.",
        "On the other hand, the cooling trend has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets, and consequently, depreciating their prices.",
        "In this scenario, the additional reduction of net exports can occur, with similar effects over the behavior in the prices of certain Brazilian assets.",
        "Moreover, the recent trajectory of price indices still evidences the existence of mismatches between the supply and demand growth, and consequently, of significant inflationary risks, in several economies, even though the intensity is now probably lower than in the middle of last year.",
        "In light of the deterioration of inflation prospects occurred in the last months, in a more uncertain environment, the Committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario is still high.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years.",
        "Particularly, monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices, partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global scale, do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to the worsening of expectations.",
        "The Copom thinks that the maintenance of monetary stability is an essential condition for the relative prices system to continue efficiently signaling the necessary adjustments on current consumption and production patterns of the economy.",
        "The Copom considers that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory continues to be high, as the heating of domestic demand and market of factors, as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some sectors, may increase the pass-through of wholesale prices to consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the propagation of initially localized pressures to consumer prices, depend in a critical manner on inflation expectations, which remain in levels incompatible with the inflation target path and continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth highlighting that although the external sector exerts some discipline on tradable goods inflation, imports prices have hiked in a strong manner.",
        "Furthermore, heated domestic demand may trigger more intense inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector - in services prices, for instance.",
        "In this context, the Copom will act aiming to ensure that inflation control gains achieved in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Committee will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast period, and will be prepared to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which one-off price adjustments become persistent or generalized.",
        "The maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception.",
        "The Copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability, even in light of global inflationary pressures, that inflation in Brazil will evolve according to the targets path in For this higher probability to continue to materialize, however, it is necessary that forward-looking inflation indicators, particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth, despite the more moderate pace due to an increase in funding costs, and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "The effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain demand.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated domestic demand, the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative prices, also over the labor market, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "Moreover, it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities prices, whose more consistent evidence appeared in the last weeks, could contribute to avoid that inflationary pressures intensify even more.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be underpinned, among other factors, by income and credit growth, continues to present significant risks to the inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, the consistent and prompt reduction of the mismatch between the expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand continues to be vital to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk premium, shorter planning horizons and, as a consequence, to the reduction of potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, in the current circumstances, there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become persistent, which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the economy heating signals and the behavior of inflation expectations, the risks for the materialization of a benign inflationary scenario, in which IPCA would resume the evolution in line with the targets path, are relevant.",
        "In fact, the deterioration of the forward-looking scenario is still present in the inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "The Copom also considers that the persistence of significant mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary dynamics.",
        "Under these circumstances, monetary policy should continue to act through the adjustment of the basic interest rate, while the balance of risks to the inflationary dynamics requires.",
        "This adjustment aims, on the one hand, to reduce such mismatch and, on the other hand, to avoid that inflationary pressures initially localized over price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation forward-looking scenario.",
        "Such scenario would have potential contractionary impacts, also through financial deleverage consequences over credit conditions, which would add up to the lagged effects of monetary policy over the countrys economic activity, with implications for the projected inflation scenario.",
        "Indeed, those Copom members understood to be more appropriate, at this early time, to raise the basic interest rate by 50 b.p.",
        "Most Committee members, however, currently understand that in spite of the deterioration on the global economic growth prospects, the risks to the materialization of a benign inflation scenario in the country have not presented enough improvement yet.",
        "In particular, those members understand that up to now there is not enough evidence of reduction of mismatch between the demand and supply expansion rhythms, as perceived by the intense use of productive factors, and that the expectations anchorage to the target path still needed to be reinforced.",
        "In such context, those Committee members understood to be more appropriate to raise the basic rate by 75 b.p.",
        "Five votes were for the monetary policy action, while three votes were in favor of elevating the Selic rate by 50 b.p.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to the projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking prices dynamics, as well as the balance of risks associated to their projections.",
        "Domestic demand has continued to expand strongly and supports the economic activity dynamics, including sectors less exposed to external competition, when the effects of stimuli factors, such as income growth, are still acting over the Brazilian economy.",
        "On its turn, the external sector contribution to a favorable inflationary scenario, in light of the strong rhythm of domestic demand expansion, of global inflationary pressures, as well as depreciation in the prices of Brazilian assets, have become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over the productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate.",
        "In such environment, the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that the higher uncertainty detected in short-term horizons disseminate to longer-term horizons.",
        "Evidently, if the risk profile changes in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario considered at the present moment, the Committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "Those variations mainly reflected the normalization of imports procedures after the interruption of the services during part of the second quarter of the year.",
        "Seventeen out of the twenty-seven activities surveyed recorded production increase in July.",
        "The indicator stood 0.9 p.p.",
        "above the level registered in the same month of 2007, reflecting the elevations of 1.4 p.p.",
        "in the IE and 0.4 p.p.",
        "Out of the items related to the current situation, demand level, mainly domestic, and current situation of business continue to present favorable evaluation.",
        "Businessmen keep confident about increasing production in the quarter ended in October.",

        "The average tenure of corporate credit operations reached 299 days, while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled 467 days.",
        "External Environment In the international outlook, the concerns regarding inflation and global demand deceleration are increasing, specially, the smaller growth of industrialized economies.",
        "Emerging economies maintain robust growth, specially the Asian economies, although they record activity level cooling, compared to the high expansion rates recorded in Moreover, it cannot be discarded greater economic activity cooling in these countries, in case the global economic deceleration is more intense and persistent.",
        "Regarding inflation, the recent fall of commodities prices, including oil prices, can provoke the accommodation of prices at a lower level in the middle run.",
        "However, available data confirm that the annual inflation levels remain high and the risks to inflation are greater in the short run, in face of the possibility of pass-trough of this trend to wages and expectations.",
        "The international financial market turmoil remains, although with less intensity.",
        "The strong commitment of important central banks to provide the necessary liquidity to the good run of the interbank market, as well as the prospect that significant part of the losses has been already registered by the financial institutions, have been fundamental for the recent performance of financial market.",
        "The deceleration observed in several current inflation indices and the fall in the prices of commodities also contributed to decrease the longer terms yield curve.",
        "However, since the beginning of September, the decrease movement of longer terms yield curve was partially reverted by the worsening of the external outlook, with the dollar appreciation and the increase of risk aversion as a result of the fear of global economy deceleration.",
        "Between July 21 and September 8, one-, three-, and six-month rates increased by 83 bps, 78 bps and 61 bps, respectively.",
        "Moreover, two- and three-year rates fell by 57 bps, and 69 bps, respectively.",
        "In its open market operations, the BCB carried out, from July 22 to September 8, weekly five- and sevenmonth fixed rate repo operations, borrowing.",
        "In the same period, the BCB conducted 35 overnight repo operations, borrowing.",
        "The BCB also conducted daily, at the end of day, one- and two-working-day-tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "As a consequence, all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the IPCA diffusion index, whose average is the highest recorded since 2004, continues to suggest dissemination of the inflationary process relatively disseminated, confirming the analysis present in previous Copom Minutes.",
        "It also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial prices, a process that began in the second half of 2007 and does not show consistent signs of accommodation.",
        "The data already released for the last months point, in short, to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, despite some accommodation at the margin may occur, due to restrictions to supply expansion in some sectors, as well as to the effects of the monetary policy change in Brazil and to the international financial turmoil.",
        "The strength of capital goods production until August has reflected the consolidation of favorable prospects for the continuity of macroeconomic stability.",
        "On its turn, the expansion of durable goods production reflects, predominantly, credit conditions, which remained, until recently, more favorable than historical patterns.",
        "Labor market continues to present quite favorable performance.",
        "The steady growth of retail sales had been reflecting, in short, the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be favored by fiscal transfers, as well as by employment and income growth, but it also will be affected, in case of persistence, by the changes in the access to credit supply, which cannot be fully associated to the monetary policy stance, and by the deterioration of consumer confidence.",
        "In fact, recent data about the absorption of capital goods was still inconclusive about an inflexion in the investment expansion trend.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, an already anticipated trend, and which is in line with assessments present in previous Inflation Reports and Copom Minutes.",
        "The increased risk aversion, observed since mid-September, after the bankruptcy of an important US financial institution, led the authorities in the US, Europe and Oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial systems, using wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money markets.",
        "Although systemic risk perception is still high, such initiatives, accompanied by programs to reinforce the capital base of relevant financial institutions, seem to have managed to restore the functioning of the interbank markets.",
        "The international liquidity contraction contributed to a deleverage process by asset managers, which in turn has been pressuring down the prices of financial assets.",
        "In the environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital flows, pressures on emerging economies currencies have intensified.",
        "In this context, the recent announcement of the currency swap agreements between the US Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of Brazil, as well as with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Mexico, should contribute to mitigate - without, however eliminate - the impacts of international financial turmoil on emerging markets.",
        "Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, the contraction trends seem to be gradually prevailing over the inflationary pressures, which, however, are still present.",
        "The dominant view still points to the expansion, at a moderate pace, of global economic activity in 2008 and 2009, but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature economies.",
        "There are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in Europe and parts of Asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices, which could be reversing.",
        "On the other hand, the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in credit quality, which may reinforce the contraction in financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of intensification of deceleration.",
        "The US economy, specifically, started to decelerate in the last quarter of 2007 and it still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector crisis, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial assets, has affected the consumers confidence, significantly contributing for depressing expenditure.",
        "The prevailing interpretation is that the activity in Europe and Japan may continue to lose dynamism in the next months.",
        "In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating considerably, inflationary pressures have reduced relatively fast.",
        "On the other hand, in emerging economies, where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more intense, the inflationary pressures have been more persistent.",
        "In this context, the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature economies, whereas in emerging economies, which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation trend, in addition to the facts mentioned above, the situation seems to be more heterogeneous.",
        "Future markets have followed the prices of oil in the spot market.",
        "However, uncertainty concerning oil prices is remarkably high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the supplys reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative prices, in addition to geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil prices trajectory, the main scenario adopted by the Copom, which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in 2008, remains plausible.",
        "However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the reduction of international oil prices can affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, on the benchmark scenario, based on the 360day swap rates estimates a 147 bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 85 bps in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite robust, and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration trend, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance.",
        "Additionally, the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets impose some adjustment in the balance of payments which, despite the increase in Brazilian economy external resilience, can increase the inflationary pressures, especially in the short run.",
        "In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects, which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant uncertainties.",
        "On the one hand, more generalized deceleration of global economic activity in the upcoming quarters points to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external demand, therefore influencing negatively the local financial conditions.",
        "On the other hand, the trend of economic cooling has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets, and consequently, depreciating their prices.",
        "In this scenario, the additional reduction of net exports can occur, with similar effects over the behavior in the prices of certain Brazilian assets.",
        "Moreover, the recent trajectory of price indices still evidences the existence of significant inflationary risks, in several economies, despite the remarkably lower intensity compared to the middle of In light of the deterioration of inflation prospects occurred in the last months, in a more uncertain environment, the Committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario is still high.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years.",
        "Particularly, monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to the worsening of expectations.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that is still high the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory.",
        "The heating of domestic demand and markets of factors, despite under higher uncertainty, as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some sectors, may facilitate the passthrough of wholesale prices to consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the materialization of this pass-through and the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer price indices depend critically on inflation expectations, which remain in levels incompatible with the inflation targets path and continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth pointing that although the external sector had been imposing some discipline on tradable goods inflation, the heating of domestic demand has pressured the prices of non-tradable items, as services.",
        "In this context, the Copom will act to ensure the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "Doing so, the Copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast period, being ready to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which one-off price readjustments become persistent or generalized.",
        "The maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception.",
        "The Copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance is essential to increase the probability that inflation in Brazil evolves once again according to the targets path in For this higher probability to continue to materialize, however, it is necessary that forward-looking inflation indicators, particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "This viewpoint is even more important in periods of higher uncertainty.",
        "In particular, the effects of the international crisis on the domestic financial conditions indicate that the contribution of credit to support domestic demand may decline more intensively than the magnitude of what would happen exclusively by the monetary policy effects.",
        "Additionally, the intensification of international crisis seems to have caused a negative effect on consumers and businesses confidence.",
        "If this situation persists, the strength of economic activity would increasingly depend on real payroll expansion and the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the signs of still heated domestic demand at the end of the third quarter, the dissemination of pressures derived from relative prices adjustments, including the labor market, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "Moreover, it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities prices, whose consistent signs emerged last weeks, could contribute to avoid even more intense inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues to present important risks to the inflationary dynamics, to which may be added, particularly in the short run, the risks derived from the trajectory of Brazilian assets prices, in a process of decreasing external funding.",
        "In this context, the prompt and consistent reduction of the mismatch between the growth of aggregate demand and supply of goods and services continues to be crucial to the assessment of different possibilities for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk premium, to shorter planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, in the current circumstances, there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation acceleration become persistent, reducing the efficacy of monetary policy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the economic heating signs regarding, for instance, labor market available data and the industry capacity utilization rates, and the behavior of inflation expectations, the risks for the materialization of a benign inflation scenario, in which IPCA would resume evolution in line with the targets path, continue relevant.",
        "Indeed, an unfavorable forward-looking scenario is still present in the inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "The Copom also thinks that the persistence of a significant mismatch between the growth paces of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary dynamics, but evaluates that the expected trajectories of domestic consumption and investment have become more uncertain.",
        "Under these circumstances, monetary policy should act according to the requirements of the balance of risks of the inflationary dynamics, through the adjustment of the basic interest rate, although not necessarily in a continuous way, aiming, on the one hand, to reduce that mismatch and, on the other hand, to avoid that inflationary pressures initially restricted to some prices indices lead to a persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation forward-looking scenario.",
        "Finally, the Committee thinks that the consolidation of more restrictive financial conditions could intensify the effects of monetary policy over aggregate demand and, throughout time, over inflation.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to the projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking prices dynamics and the balance of risks associated to their projections.",
        "Domestic demand continues to increase vigorously, supporting the economic activity strength, including sectors less exposed to external competition, at a moment when the effects of stimuli factors, such as income growth, are still influencing the Brazilian economy.",
        "In addition, the contribution of the external sector to a favorable inflationary scenario, in light of the strong depreciation in the prices of Brazilian assets and the apparent reduction in the countrys capacity to import, has become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment on the economys productive potential still need to consolidate.",
        "In this context, the monetary policy should act so to bring inflation back to the targets path already in 2009, in order to avoid that the higher uncertainty detected in shorter-term horizons disseminate to longer-term periods.",
        "IPCA core inflation indices increased in the last twelve months through September, while the core inflation by exclusion and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures accelerated over the same period.",
        "The milder variation of IPC-Br in September reflected the persistent decrease in the prices of food and beverages and deceleration in the prices of the remaining components of the index, except for clothing.",
        "The September IPA result reflected the less sharpen fall in agricultural prices, while industrial prices showed deceleration.",
        "Partial indexes on October inflation show acceleration relative to September results for both wholesale and consumer price inflation.",
        "As for wholesale, according to IGP-M results for the second ten-day period of October, agricultural and industrial prices indicate stronger growth than on the previous month.",

        "The financial crisis assumed more generalized aspect world wide, spreading geographically.",
        "Credit channels were obstructed by uncertainty and liquidity and solvency problems that emerged subsequently.",
        "In addition to that, the exchange rate depreciation movement, simultaneous in various economies, found international trade in contraction, or, in the best hypothesis, in a situation of important deceleration.",
        "Due to the deterioration of the international financial crisis and the widening of global recession risk, governments and central banks of developed economies committed themselves to an aggressive movement in defense of the soundness of their respective financial systems.",
        "In this sense, they increased the deposits guarantees, expanding the government guarantees on interbank operations and committed to support all the banks considered systemically important, even encompassing capitalization.",
        "In Europe, rescue plans aiming to recapitalize banks and defreeze the credit market are being approved.",
        "It is important to highlight that the resources will be provided from each respective countrys budget and there isnt forecast of creation of any single fund.",
        "Regarding single measures, only uniformed intervention rules were adopted, which intend to avoid distortions in the regional banking market.",
        "Recent data point to the reduction of inflationary pressures in the global economy.",
        "With the substantial fall in the prices of oil and agricultural commodities, and the increase of unemployment, the inflationary process already records turning points in the majority of mature economies.",
        "In the US, this behavior is intensified by the dollar appreciation.",
        "In China, despite the increase in domestic energy prices, inflation cooling is confirmed.",
        "The period was characterized by high volatility and increased risk aversion in the international markets, as a result of the development of the financial crises in the US and in Europe and of the fear of global economy deceleration.",
        "The risk aversion boosted the generalized reduction of the leveraged positions in several markets, generating high losses in the international stock exchanges and the dollar appreciation.",
        "Under this scenario, the future interest rate in domestic markets recorded sharp increase, intensified by the BRL depreciation against the dollar.",
        "Between September 8 and October 27, one-, three-, and six-month rates increased by 47 bps, 38 bps and 72 bps, respectively.",

        "In the same period, the BCB conducted 36 overnight repo operations, borrowing.",
        "The BCB also conducted daily, at the end of day, one- and two-working-day-tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "In short, since the end of 2007, inflation has diverged from the targets path.",
        "The three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB have evolved in line with the headline index.",
        "On a twelve-month trailing basis, the three core inflation measures continued to follow the behavior of headline inflation.",
        "As a consequence, all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the behavior of diffusion indices suggests increased dissemination of the inflationary process, confirming the analysis present in previous Copom Minutes.",
        "It also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial prices, a process that began in the second half of 2007 and does not signal accommodation.",
        "The data already released for the last months point, in short, to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, despite at a more moderate pace and subject to possible limits to supply expansion.",
        "Despite the strong fall observed in May, there are no sufficient evidences of inflection in the expansion process of capital goods production, which has been mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic growth.",
        "On its turn, the dynamism of durable consumer goods production reflects, predominantly, credit conditions, which remain more favorable than historical patterns.",
        "The existence of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors suggests that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion can be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions, added up to imports penetration increase.",

        "Sector indicators, for instance, relative to automobile sales in June, corroborate this assessment.",
        "The maintenance of installed capacity utilization rates at historically high levels occurs in several sectors despite investments accumulated in the last twelve months.",
        "In short, recent data indicate that, although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization rates, the maturation of investment projects has not been sufficient, until now, to significantly limit existing mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The trade balance continues to present deceleration at the margin, a trend that was already expected, and is in line with assessments present in Inflation Reports and previous Copom Minutes.",
        "Regarding the external scenario, the world economy still shows divergent pressures.",
        "On the one hand, even though economic activity, in general, has been stronger than anticipated in the majority of countries in the first semester, which in some cases resulted in upward revisions in growth projections for the year, the more recent data shows some signs of weakening, especially in mature economies.",
        "This trend should continue during the second semester.",
        "On the other hand, the increase in the prices of raw material, and the pressures of heated demand over the capacity of supply expansion, which are particularly evident in emerging economies, have resulted in strong acceleration of current inflation, significantly impacting, in several cases, inflationary expectations.",
        "In addition, a severe financial crisis in the U.S. and, at a lower extension, in Europe, is added up to this difficult macroeconomic scenario.",
        "In this context, although the existence of strong inflationary pressures is cause of concern for the majority of monetary authorities, policy reactions, aiming to control demand, have occurred unsynchronized, situation that tends to persist.",
        "Specifically, the US economy seems to have entered a process of economic stagnation since the last quarter of 2007, and still suffers the impact of the crisis in the real estate sector, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, in combination with higher oil prices, affects consumer confidence, contributing importantly to depress consumption.",
        "Even if the influence of monetary and fiscal stimulus can reduce the risk of a significant contraction in activity, the dominant scenario continues to point to a more consistent recover only from Even after significant strengthening of the capital basis of relevant financial institutions, uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the US subprime mortgages market crisis over US and European banking system and over credit conditions for households and corporate.",
        "The systemic risk perception increased again in the last weeks, as financial problems have worsened due to a cyclic deterioration in credit quality, which tends to reinforce the tightening of financial conditions, increasing the risk of slowdown intensification.",
        "The dominant view seems to be that the economic activity in Europe - despite the better-than-expected performance at the start of the year, anchored in the German economy - and in Japan might also decelerate in the second half of the year.",
        "In the central economies, therefore, the prospects for adoption of monetary tightening policies seem limited.",
        "On the other hand, despite some moderation at the margin, economic growth in emerging economies is still strong and, so far, it has apparently been little affected by the US mortgage crisis, offsetting the effects of economic deceleration in mature economies.",
        "In fact, in light of pressures over the availability of production factors, inflation acceleration points to the continuity of monetary tightening policies in emerging economies.",
        "However, the policies aimed at reducing the external vulnerability of the economy have been successful, contributing to mitigate, but not to eliminate, the effects of the external scenario difficulties over the Brazilian economic activity, whose dynamism has essentially been driven by domestic demand.",

        "Despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil prices forecasts, the main scenario considered by the Copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in 2008, although the probability of materialization of an alternative scenario is relevant.",
        "However, apart from the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, one should recognize that the consistent elevation of international oil prices impacts domestic economy both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate based on the 360-day swap rates estimates a 131bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 87bps spread in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite robust, and is at least partially the cause of the short-term inflationary pressures, despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance.",
        "However, in general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues subject to contradictory effects and highly uncertain.",
        "On the one hand, the prospects of a possible more pronounced deceleration of global activity in the coming months points to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external demand.",
        "On the other hand, the recent trajectory of price indices both in mature and in emerging economies evidences the existence of mismatches between the supply and demand growth, and consequently, of significant inflationary risks to the global economy.",
        "In light of the deterioration of inflation prospects, in a more uncertain environment, the Committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario continues to increase.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years.",
        "Particularly, monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices, partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global scale, do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to worse expectations.",
        "The Copom thinks that the maintenance of monetary stability is an essential condition for the relative prices system to continue efficiently guiding the necessary adjustments on current consumption and production patterns of the economy.",
        "The Copom considers that the probability that inflationary pressures initially limited represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory has increased, as the heating of domestic demand and market of factors, as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some sectors, may increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the propagation of initially localized pressures to consumer prices, depend in a critical manner on inflation expectations, which increased significantly in the last weeks and continue to be carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth highlighting that although the external sector induces some discipline in tradable goods inflation, imports prices have been increasing strongly; furthermore, heated domestic demand may trigger more intense inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector - in services prices, for instance.",
        "In this context, the Copom will act aiming to ensure that inflation control gains achieved in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Committee will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast period, prepared to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which one-off price adjustments become persistent or generalized.",
        "The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the maintenance of the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has been occurring in the last years.",
        "The Copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that in Brazil inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path, even in light of global inflationary pressures.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is necessary that forward-looking inflation indicators, particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "During the coming months, despite the more moderate credit growth pace due to an increase in funding costs, and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative prices, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the last months of 2008 and in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "It should be noticed that the possible accommodation of commodities prices could contribute to avoid that inflationary pressures intensify even more.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be underpinned, among other factors, by income and credit growth, continues to present significant risks to inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, the consistent and prompt reduction of the mismatch between the expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand continues to be vital to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence and Brazilian experience indicate that higher inflation rates lead to higher risk premium, shorter planning horizons and, as a consequence, lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, in the current circumstances, there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become persistent, which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary policy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the economy heating signals, as illustrated by the acceleration of some wholesale prices and the evolution of core inflation measures, and by the fast increase in inflation expectations, the risks for the materialization of a benign inflationary scenario, in which IPCA would remain in line with the targets path, are relevant.",
        "In fact, the deterioration of the forward-looking scenario is already present in the inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "The Copom also considers that the persistence of significant mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand has increased the risk for the inflationary dynamics.",
        "In these circumstances, monetary policy should act vigorously through the adjustment of the basic interest rate while the balance of risks to the inflationary dynamics requires, in order to, on the one hand, reduce such mismatch and, on the other hand, avoid that inflationary pressures initially localized on price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation forward-looking scenario.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom decides according to inflation prospects, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its projections.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand vigorously, backingup economic activity dynamism, including sectors little exposed to external competition, at a time when the effects of important incentive factors, such as income growth, are still perceived.",
        "On its turn, the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary scenario, in light of robust domestic demand growth and the increase of global inflationary pressures, seems to become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate.",
        "In such environment, the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that short-term uncertainties contaminate longer time horizons.",
        "Evidently, if the risk profile changes in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario considered at the present moment, the Committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",

        "Yet, projections on GDP growth for 2001 have already incorporated the slowing pace of economic activity.",
        "To conclude, the deceleration of the industrial sector, particularly the transformation segment, may be specially due to the reduction in demand as a response to lower consumer confidence, associated not only with the rise in interest rates and to the reduction of financing tenures, but also with restrictions deriving from reduced energy supply.",

        "By definition, this increase would remain embodied in the inflation rate for the next twelve months, fading out at the end of the period, provided that second-round effects were avoided.",

        "This reduction, however, can be attenuated by the substitution of domestic supply by imported goods.",

        "For fuels and lubricant, the import reduction, due to the contraction in economic growth, might be mitigated by the necessity to substitute electric energy for energy generated from oil by products.",
        "Therefore, both, exports and imports shall be impacted from cuts due to rationing and to the reduction in the activity level.",
        "Finally, regarding prices behavior, the immediate effect refers to the impact of surcharges on energy bills of households, already estimated to be around 0.15 percentage point in Junes IPCA.",
        "It shall be highlighted that this effect will be the opposite at the end of the process.",
        "As to the indirect impact of rationing, it shall be considered, on the one hand, the restrictive perspectives on supply and the consequent rise of costs.",

        "Therefore, it was natural to expect that the foreign exchange market would seek a new equilibrium.",
        "The potential pass through from exchange rate depreciation to prices was one of the reasons for the reaction of monetary policy in the period, with an increase in the interest rate to attempt to neutralize these effects.",
        "Inflation expectations, although they were revised upward, did not accompany the pace of depreciation, indicating that part of the latter was not perceived as permanent and, therefore, should not be transmitted to final prices.",
        "However, the total impact of the pass through from depreciation to prices should also include the effect on the adjustment of tariffs and other managed prices, especially of gasoline.",
        "In this more general context, the exchange rate depreciation is estimated to contribute with at least 1.5 percentage points to the expected inflation for this year.",
        "More recently, however, the dynamics observed in the foreign exchange market changed.",
        "Over the last few weeks, the domestic price of the dollar rose considerably.",

        "Although this self-feeding process of exchange rate depreciation is not sustainable in the medium run, it may have nefarious consequences for the economy while it lasts, by distorting consumption and investment decisions, affecting corporate balance sheets, and, most of all, changing relative prices and threatening the inflation targets.",
        "Copom determined that measures should be implemented so that price formation in the exchange market ceases to present the characteristics of a speculative bubble.",
        "These measures include an elevation in the cost of maintaining speculative positions and the adoption of the disposition to irrigate the market with additional resources, stemming from reinforcements to the financing of the balance of payments, in order to provide the adequate liquidity for price formation and to avoid the anticipation of future demand for defensive or precautionary reasons.",
        "These actions will be backed by the implementation of important structural measures in banking and taxation.",

        "In particular, it can be cited, greater uncertainties as to the pace of deceleration of the US economy, reflected in part in the rapid decline in stock prices traded in its stock exchanges, and the confidence crisis in important emerging markets like Argentina and, in a minor degree, Turkey.",
        "The world economy has been marked by the deceleration in the United States and by stagnation of the Japanese economy, whereas European countries have sustained a moderate growth path.",
        "The international scene has also been influenced by volatility in oil prices.",

        "In relation to Argentina, the economy experienced a period of growing uncertainty about the growth capacity in the short run, and about the political support for the fiscal adjustment proposed by the government.",

        "The main impact of aggregate demand expansion has been on the trade balance.",
        "Although imports partially respond to the increase in manufactured exports, it is undeniable that the demand pressure has affected the imported quantum.",
        "For the whole year, the trade balance will essentially depend on the growth differentials between Brazil and its main trade partners, and on the path of the real exchange rate.",
        "The reduction in the trade balance and the corresponding increase in the current account deficit have contributed to weaken the exchange rate, despite the fact that external financing needs have increased only moderately.",
        "More recently, the exchange rate has been affected by the uncertainty in the external conjuncture, particularly in relation to the magnitude of the downturn in the United States economy and to the political crisis in Argentina.",

        "However, the trend points to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, which will continue to be favored by the several incentive factors that influence economic activity, such as employment and credit expansion, the monetary easing already implemented, the fiscal impulse and, in some sectors, the reduced inventory levels.",

        "On the other hand, strong economic growth of main Asian emerging economies, which were apparently little affected by the US mortgage crisis, as well as the strength and steadiness of current expansion of other emerging economies, even under increasing inflationary pressures and tight monetary cycles, have been fundamental factors to offset the effects of US economic deceleration.",

        "Oil prices, a systematic source of international uncertainty, not only remained at historically high levels but also continued highly volatile.",
        "This behavior reflects, in addition to structural changes in global energy markets, recurrent geopolitical tensions.",
        "Despite the significant uncertainties inherent to expectations about the future trend for oil prices, the main scenario considered by the Copom remains plausible, in which domestic gasoline prices remain unchanged in However, apart from the trajectory of domestic gasoline prices, one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts the domestic economy, both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as by the deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "The prices of other commodities have also presented high volatility in the last months, reflecting the increased uncertainty about the prospects for global demand growth and the turmoil on global financial markets.",

        "However, imports growth and the benign investment behavior, which continues to expand robustly, have contributed to slow down this process.",
        "Moreover, despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of the rapid growth recorded in the international economy in the last years and the volatility increase observed in global markets in the last months, the prospects for Brazilian external financing in the forecast period suggest, according to newly available information, that the balance of payments may not represent imminent risk to the inflation scenario.",
        "On the other hand, the relevant inflation increase both in mature and emerging economies in recent months evidences the intensification of the inflationary risks on the global outlook.",
        "Therefore, although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets trajectory, additional uncertainties surround the inflation path.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last years.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand and market of factors can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "The Committee understands that the prospects for this pass-through, as well as for the generalization of the pressures initially focused on consumer price inflation, depend mostly on inflation expectations, which remain carefully monitored.",
        "Additionally, although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable sector, the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector, for instance, such as in the services sector.",
        "In this context, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, as well as inflation expectations within the forecast period, discriminating between one-off and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception underway.",
        "As a consequence of this improved perception, the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators, in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, evolve in a harmonic way.",
        "The Committee emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation.",
        "Since the beginning of the monetary easing cycle, in September 2005, the Selic rate has already been reduced by 850 b.p., with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine months.",
        "Consequently, neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts yet, nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely materialized.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth and payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, activity level should also reflect the effects of the possibly more intense expansion of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next quarters.",
        "Consequently, the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this expansion.",
        "These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have effects as of The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity.",
        "This factor, together with the external sector, has helped to mitigate inflationary pressures.",
        "However, the Copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be sustained, among other factors, by the impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented this year, may bring non-insignificant risks to the inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and demand is even more relevant to the assessment of possibilities of monetary policy stance.",
        "Aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable environment, the Copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary trajectory.",
        "This strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "That is the reason why variables such as inflation projections, the balance of risks associated to the forward-looking scenario and especially the preventive stance in the decision-making process of the Copom are so important.",
        "Prudence assumes an even more important role in this process, like at the current moment, when the deterioration of the balance of inflationary risks reduces the safety margin of the monetary policy.",
        "This decision aims to preserve the gains in inflation control and to ensure that the strengthening of economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid fundamentals.",

        "This reduction was mainly driven by the addition of the September inflation result, below market expectations.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of demand expansion remains robust, and may increase the probability of significant inflationary pressures on short-term inflation.",
        "Investment expansion and imports growth have contributed to retard this process, limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained growth.",
        "Moreover, despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of strong growth in the international economy and the heightened volatility in global markets in the last months, the prospects for Brazilian external financing in the forecast period suggest, according to the information available until now, that the balance of payments should not present a risk to the inflation scenario.",
        "On the other hand, some recent evidences point to an intensification of the risks on the global inflation outlook, as suggested by the evolution of some raw materials prices.",
        "Therefore, although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets path, additional uncertainty surrounds this outlook.",
        "As in recent meetings, the Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the future.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation.",
        "Additionally, although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable sector, the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the non-tradable sector.",
        "The Copom also observes that even though the upward movement of IPCA inflation expectations for 2008 has stabilized over the recent weeks at a level below the target established for 2008, this process must be carefully monitored.",
        "In this context, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "In this respect, the Copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures, discriminating between oneoff and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the circumstances.",
        "The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception underway.",
        "The scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow, as a consequence of this improved perception.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets path.",
        "For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators, in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and demand, remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last quarters.",
        "The Committee emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation.",
        "Since the beginning of the monetary easing cycle, in September 2005, the Selic rate has already been reduced by 850 b.p., with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine months.",
        "Consequently, neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts yet, nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely materialized.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.",
        "During the coming months, credit growth and payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic activity.",
        "As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next quarters of the year and for Consequently, the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this expansion.",
        "These issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have limited effects in 2007 and predominant impacts in The Copom recognizes the contribution of investment, enlarging the productive capacity, and of the external sector to mitigate inflationary pressures, but evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which should continue to be sustained by factors such as the impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented this year, may bring non-insignificant risks to the inflationary dynamics.",
        "Aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable environment, the Copom has privileged a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary trajectory.",
        "This strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation.",
        "That is the reason why variables such as inflation projections, the balance of risks associated to the prospective scenario and the preventive stance in the decision-making process of the Copom are so important.",
        "Prudence assumes an even more important role in this process, like at the current moment, when the deterioration of the balance of inflationary risks reduces the safety margin of the monetary policy.",
        "Under this context, considering the uncertainties associated with both the transmission mechanisms of the monetary policy and the prospective growth pace of aggregate supply and demand, the Copom decided to pause the monetary policy easing process.",
        "This decision aims to preserve the gains in inflation control and to ensure that the strengthening of economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid fundamentals.",

        "Domestic demand continues to expand vigorously, backing-up economic activity strength.",
        "This expansion encompasses some sectors little exposed to external competition, at a time when the effects of important incentive factors, such as the monetary easing already implemented, are still not fully perceived.",
        "In spite of not being an imminent threat to inflation prospects, the contribution of the external sector to the maintenance of a benign inflationary scenario may become less effective, at a moment when the effects of investment over the productive capacity of the economy still need to consolidate.",

        "The deceleration of IPA-DI in September reflected the lower change in industrial and agricultural prices.",
        "The main drivers for upward agricultural price pressures in September were the prices of soy, corn, fruit and legumes, perishable milk and wheat.",
        "The deceleration in the agricultural IPA stemmed mainly from the prices of perishable milk and poultry, the downturn in the prices of bovines and the recurrent fall in the price of sugar cane, compared to the previous month.",

        "The most recent data indicate that investment has contributed to a slowdown in the elevation of capacity utilization rates, but has not been sufficient to avoid the persistence at relatively high levels, which coincided, in the past, with periods of inflation acceleration.",
        "In this context, the expansion of investment and the maturing of projects will be fundamental to avoid sharp mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and demand.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "Despite the deceleration, at the margin, the trade balance continues to present robust performance, confirming the evaluations reported in Inflation Reports and previous Copom Minutes that depict important structural changes in the Brazilian foreign trade.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, imports have been growing more rapidly than exports at the margin, due not only to the strengthening of the BRL, but also, and mainly, to the higher level of economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, the effects of US real state sector crisis over global growth may slow down global demand for Brazilian exports.",
        "In any way, these two movements point out to an adjustment process in the trade balance, due to important structural changes in the Brazilian foreign trade over the recent years.",

        "These developments had important impact over monetary policy prospects in developed economies, towards limiting, at least in the short term, the scope for restrictive stance.",
        "In particular, the probability of additional monetary tightening in the US seems reduced, not only due to the problems of interbank liquidity, but also because, even considering that part of the adjustments in the US activity level in response to the crisis may already have occurred, it is more likely that spillover effects on the financial sector and the consumer confidence cause a stronger economic deceleration.",
        "Even considering that Europe and the major Asian countries record robust expansions, despite the economic cooling in Japan, the US crisis may have negatively impact world growth.",
        "However, the Brazilian economy remains sound and shows greater resilience to face the international markets turmoil.",

        "Oil prices, another source of international uncertainty, remains at elevated levels and still presents high volatility.",
        "On one hand, this behavior reflects structural shifts in global demand for energy and, on the other hand, recurrent episodes of geopolitical tensions.",
        "Despite the uncertainties surrounding the expectations about the future trend for oil prices, the main scenario considered by the Copom, which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in 2007, remains plausible.",

        "In addition to investment expansion, imports growth has remarkably contributed to slow down this process, complementing domestic production and, therefore, limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained growth.",

        "In accumulated terms up to April, the deficit came to $ 2.5 billion, while the criterion agreed upon for the first half of the year was $ 2.69 billion\nIn the month of April, the drop in wholesale price indices was caused by the ongoing decline in farm product prices and deceleration in industrial growth.",
        "At the retail level, the increase was a consequence of higher apparel prices, a lesser drop under food costs and the impacts of the minimum wage increase.",
        "In the case of the broad consumer price index (IPCA), the 11.03% minimum wage increase accounted for 0.34 percentage points of the 0.42% growth registered in the month.",

        "The shocks thus identified are listed below and their impacts were reassessed in light of new information, particularly as regards petroleum prices.",
        "The basic scenario considers the following hypotheses: the trajectories of fed fund rates and international oil price quotations implicit in futures contracts, considering that the latter trajectory increased since the end of April, representing growth of US$ 3 in the average per barrel price in futures contracts for the second half of the year; neutrality on the part of the farm sector in terms of the pressures that could be brought to bear on prices during the course of the year, without ignoring the importance of normal seasonal fluctuations; fiscal policy in compliance with the accumulated primary surplus target of the consolidated public sector corresponding to 3.25% of GDP in 2000, with a significant contribution to continued price stability; short-term persistence of international market\n\nvolatility at the present level; and an outlook for growth in the world economy.",
        "Based on simulations with the central scenario, it was concluded that maintenance of interest at the current level is compatible with the inflation targets defined for 2000 and 2001.",
        "Once the central scenario had been presented, simulations were made with the different economic models based on alternative scenarios.",
        "The major differences in relation to the central scenario involved the passthrough of international petroleum price increases to internal prices.",
        "Short-term forecasts and leading indicators for inflation were also presented.",
        "The results point to an upturn in inflation in the second and third quarters of 2000.",
        "More specifically, the leading indicators suggest greater pressure on prices in July and August, while the short- term nonstructural models point to a moderate high in inflation in the second quarter when compared to the first.",
        "Analysis of the inflation core must still be added to this equation.",
        "A comparison of the median of this indicator in the final quarter of 1999 with the median in the first four months of 2000 leads to the conclusion that the decline in inflation registered by consumer price indices is a result\n\nof a reduction in the underlying process of inflation revealed by the core.",
        "The median of inflation expectations as measured by the IPCA and gathered by the daily Banco Central survey came to 6.10% on May 24, indicating an ongoing process of convergence to the target of 6.00%.",

        "NBCE were offered on three occasions for purposes of rolling maturing exchange securities.",
        "In the case of operations with papers for which the National Treasury was liable, the result was an expansionary impact of R$ 7.5 billion.",
        "The National Treasury effected six LTN sales in the period under consideration, registering a financial value of R$ 9.9 billion.",
        "Redemptions came to R$ 9.2 billion, of which R$ 2.0 billion were carried out in advance through a single public purchase offer with three maturities.",

        "Banco Central operated on the open market on 12 different occasions and always with the purpose of injecting resources.",
        "The purpose of these operations was to preserve the liquidity equilibrium of the financial system for a total of twenty three business days.",
        "Analysis of supply and demand indicates an absence of imbalances capable of generating significant inflationary pressures on the horizon pertinent to the inflation target system.",
        "Growth in aggregate demand has occurred in an organized manner.",
        "On the one hand, consumption increases as a result of greater sales of consumer durables which, in turn, is a natural consequence of increased credit availability and a slight reduction in borrower interest rates.",
        "At the same time, investments have shown clear signs of recovery, as evident in growth under capital goods production.",
        "The increase in net exports, led by sales of manufactured and semimanufactured goods, has not been even more expressive due to the high in international oil prices.",
        "On the other hand, continued fiscal austerity, with primary surpluses higher than\n\noriginally forecast, has reduced the risks of noncompliance with the fiscal targets defined for the year.",
        "Aggregate supply has accompanied growth in demand and contributed to deceleration of price indices in recent months.",
        "Expanded industrial sector employment, which is one of the primary characteristics of the current moment, is still not sufficient to be reflected in declining rates of joblessness.",
        "The reason underlying this conclusion is that improvement in the climate of confidence in the economy also encourages greater participation of the labor force.",
        "The average real earnings of persons employed have been recovering gradually without creating undue cost pressures.",
        "Though quite high in several sectors of the economy, the average level of utilization of installed capacity is consistent with the performance of industry in general and the current outlook for greater investments in productive capacity would seem sufficient to offset possible supply lags.",
        "Though the general situation would seem to favor price stability, the supply shock generated by international oil prices, which increased in May in both spot and futures contracts, and by higher government managed prices forecast for the second and third quarters, are factors that reflect pressures on the future trajectory of inflation.",
        "At\n\nthe same time, the short-term persistence of a highly volatile international financial market, coupled with such other factors as the trend to an increasingly tighter monetary policy in the United States, should also be seen as negative shocks on the future trajectory of inflation.",
        "These factors have contributed to a significant increase in the Brazil risk premium.",
        "At the same time, the question of uncertainties regarding the value of indexing of the Employment Compensation Fund (FGTS) also generates a negative impact on perceptions of the Brazil risk, even though it exerts no pressures on current public sector expenditures.",
        "However, to a great extent, this potential impact has already been incorporated into market expectations.",
        "Despite acknowledging the risks listed above, an alternative posture gives due consideration to the fact that the country managed to reverse the consumer inflation trend in the first four months of the year.",
        "At the moment, the inflation expectations (IPCA) of economic agents for 2000 are concentrated in the range of the 6% target and below those notified in the month of April.",
        "Another indicator of importance to this turnaround is the inflation core which declined in the first four months of 2000 when compared to the end of 1999.",
        "The rapid reversal in the trajectory of domestic prices evident in a drop of more\n\nthan five percentage points in annualized inflation in the first four months of the year in comparison to the final four months of 1999 (4.25% as against 9.54%) suggests there is room for a reduction in the nation’s current rates of interest.",
        "In light of the potential impact of recent and future events on the expected inflation trajectory, Copom voted by seven to one to maintain the Selic rate target unchanged at 18.5% per year.",
        "The dissenting vote favored a reduction to 18% per year.",
        "At the close of the meeting, it was announced that, based on the Schedule of Ordinary COPOM Meetings, released by Banco Central Communiqué no.",
        "7,228, dated 01.19.2000, the Committee would meet again on June 19, 2000, at 3:00 PM, for technical presentations and on the following day, at 4:30 PM in order to discuss monetary policy guidelines.",
        "Among the factors that contributed to this turnaround, one should cite more plentiful credit and lower interest rates on bank credits, coupled with rising exports and private investment.",
        "Personal credit and financing for acquisition of goods were the segments that turned in the strongest growth.",
        "Growth was particularly strong under sales involving goods with high unit value as a result of a more ample supply of credit.",
        "This movement corroborates the improvement that has occurred in consumer credit conditions, making it much easier to purchase goods over longer terms and at lesser interest rates.",
        "Another factor that has contributed to a greater credit supply is the decline in the net rate of defaults.",
        "This was the lowest level in the last 11 months and was caused by both a decrease in current defaults registered and an increase in cancellations of past defaults.",
        "Investment indicators registered growth throughout the first half of the year.",
        "One should stress that the manufactured goods exported by Brazil contain high levels of imported components.",
        "However, when distributed into use categories, the only sector to register successive records was output of intermediate goods.",
        "At the end of June, the output levels of durable goods, capital and semi and nondurable goods were still well below the most recent peak in this series.",
        "Frosts in the month of July are expected to generate adverse impacts on the output of such winter crops as wheat and the intermediate corn harvest.",
        "Despite this, however, this years harvest should still be slightly greater than that of last year.",
        "With regard to the labor market, figures for the first half of the year indicate that the process of employment and productivity growth begun toward the end of 1999 has moved steadily forward.",
        "Increased employment was registered in all sectors of the economy, with the sole exception of construction.",
        "The result was creation of 590 thousand jobs in the first half of the year.",
        "Recent indicators further strengthen the signs that the United States economic performance has begun leveling off.",
        "Notwithstanding the high level of activity, inflation has remained stable, mostly as a result of productivity gains.",
        "These figures indicate that inflation is firmly under control.",
        "International oil market price moved upward once again at the end of July, reflecting worries generated by insufficient United States stocks, particularly in the case of such derivatives as gasoline.",
        "In the month of July, both general price indices and consumer price indices registered the highest growth rates of the year.",
        "The products responsible for this high were few and included beef, milk, beans and _ products.",
        "Though these increases were no surprise to the market, their magnitude was unexpected and led the institutions included in the survey carried out by Banco Central to revise their projections upward for the year as a whole.",
        "In order to evaluate the inflation outlook for the year, one must first identify the shocks capable of generating impacts on future price level trends.",
        "These shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of new information.",
        "In the first place, with the drought in major meat and milk production areas, the effects of the off-season period were felt earlier than usual.",
        "Secondly, the failure of the sugarcane harvest in the southeast region generated a strong increase in sugar and alcohol prices, with indirect impacts on gasoline prices.",
        "This unexpected performance had the natural impact of shifting the start of the future inflation trajectory upward.",
        "Parallel to this, since fuel increases occurred in the second half of July, part of the impact will still be felt in terms of August inflation.",
        "Despite lesser probability of changes in fed fund interest rates up to the end of the year, the hypothesis of a small increase in the fourth quarter, which is implicit in futures contracts, was maintained.",
        "Both leading indicators for inflation and short-term forecasts were presented.",
        "The leading indicators point to successive decline in inflation between August and November, with a slight upturn in December.",

        "At the same time, Copom gave due attention to the fact that two important decisions were to be taken in the\n\nfollowing week: the OPEC meeting called to discuss a possible increase in output and the meeting of the Federal Open Mark Committee (FOMC) to discuss US basic interest rates.",
        "It was the understanding of Copom that, despite the positive expectations regarding these two variables, there was still some uncertainty that would justify introduction of the downward bias.",
        "The preponderant position within Copom was that, independently of any future decision, the time was ripe for an accentuated cut in the interest rate, considering that recent inflation results had significantly changed Copom’s expectations with respect to inflation for 2000, even in the framework of the aforementioned risk factors.",
        "Another point of view was raised in the sense that uncertainties as to the two decisions cited above required a more moderate interest rate cutback that could be further deepened with the adoption of a downward bias and utilization of that bias should the two events produce positive results.",
        "This position would have cloaked Copom’s decision with a more conservative and cautious character.",
        "From this point of view, a more moderate move in the context of current uncertainties would create space for a more aggressive approach in the future.",

        "In 2000, a stronger reduction in interest rates on peso deposits cut the differential in relation to earnings on dollar deposits.",
        "For the most part, the downward trajectory under general price indices has resulted from deceleration in wholesale prices, concentrated mostly under farm prices.",
        "Despite currency valuation, the lesser pace of deceleration in industrial prices was due to price rises under plastics, iron, steel and derivatives and sugar.",
        "Viewed over a twelve-month horizon, growth in the general price index - 10 (IGP-10), general price index - market (IGP-M) and general price index - domestic supply (IGP-DI) closed at February levels of 18.03%, 16.78% and 14.96%, respectively, as compared to December results of 20.09%, 20.1% and 19.98%, in the same order.",
        "The performance of consumer prices in the month of February demonstrated that the seasonal pressures generated by in natura foodstuffs and education outlays evident in the previous month had been dissipated.",
        "Another cause of the sharp downturn in these indices were clothing clearance sales and the ongoing downward movement in the prices of other food products.",
        "The accumulated 12-month rates closed at 6.95%, 8.04%, and 7.86% in the month of February, viewed against corresponding December figures of 8.64%, 9.12%, and 8.94%.",
        "In the first two months of the current year, the inflationary pressures that had marked the final months of 1999 were dissipated, principally with regard to primary sector prices.",
        "The reasons underlying these results were the start of the current annual farm harvest and gradual normalization of the supply of animal protein.",
        "In the current quarter, there are no significant signs of other factors with the potential for altering the downward trajectory of inflation, with the sole exception of the direct impacts of the recent upward movement in fuel prices.",
        "The Getúlio Vargas Foundation has begun issuing its figures for core inflation expressed by the IPC-Br.",
        "The methodology chosen is that of recalculating inflation for each month, after removing the highest and lowest price changes from the index components (percentiles below 20 and above 80).",
        "In the case of prices that normally increase just once per year, the increase is spread over 12 months, thus avoiding the systematic withdrawal of this result from the core.",
        "The resulting indicator confirms the analysis above: the core did in fact remain steady in the range of 0.5% between October and January, dropping to 0.17% in February.",
        "Prospective assessment of inflation trends\n\nAn evaluation of the inflation outlook required identification of shocks with potential for generating impacts on future price level trajectories.",
        "Those identified are basically the same as discussed at the previous Copom meeting, though their impacts were re-evaluated in light of information that has become available since that meeting.",
        "Consequently, the basic scenario analyzed is premised by the following hypotheses: fed fund rates and international petroleum price trajectories based on those implicit in the respective futures contracts for these two segments; average increase of 11.2% in government-managed prices in 2000, with a direct impact of 2.6 percentage points on growth in the broad consumer price index (IPCA), corresponding to a marginal contribution of 1.8 percentage points to annual inflation; rise in the minimum wage to R$ 150; farm sector neutrality as regards pressures on prices during the entire year, though the expected seasonal increase in the supply of farm products in the first half of the year was given due consideration; and a fiscal policy that complies with the target for the accumulated consolidated public sector primary surplus of 3.25% of GDP in 2000, thus making a highly positive contribution to price stability; outlook for positive growth in the world economy, thus generating international market liquidity conditions that will ensure a comfortable margin for financing the balance of payments.",
        "Once the central scenario had been presented, simulations were made of the different economic models based on alternative scenarios.",
        "The major differences in relation to the first scenario were concentrated under oil prices and the so-called Brazil risk.",
        "Based on the simulation exercises with the central scenario, the conclusion was drawn that maintenance of interest rates at their current level would make it possible to comply with inflation targets for 2000 and 2001.",
        "The impact of the shocks foreseen for the second and third quarter influence this conclusion.",
        "Should the intensity of these shocks be less than expected, the greater will be the leeway for complying with the targets.",
        "However, given the lag that exists in terms of the aggregate demand passthrough mechanism, current monetary policy will generate impacts only in the final quarter of this year.",
        "Short-term forecasts were made together with leading indicators for inflation.",
        "The results point to an upward trend in the second quarter of 2000.",
        "More specifically, the leading indicators foresee pressure on prices starting in the month of April.",
        "Measured by the IPCA, median inflation expectations gathered through the daily Banco Central survey were still slightly above the inflation target for 2000 (6.5% as against the target of 6%) on March 21.",
        "Since the month of February, these expectations have been consistently revised downward.",
        "Money market and open market operations\n\nAt its meeting on February 15 and 16, COPOM maintained The Selic rate unaltered at 19% per year, with no indication of a bias.",
        "From February 16 to March 21, definitive operations with papers issued by Banco Central generated a contractive monetary impact of R$ 0.4 billion, based on net redemptions of debt indexed to exchange.",
        "One should note that NBCE with terms of four years were placed.",
        "From February 15 to March 20, the National Treasury held 10 traditional LTN auctions, with total placements of R$ 18.4 billion, as compared to redemptions of R$ 8.5 billion.",
        "In the five auctions of six-month LTN, the average rates were systematically reduced from 19.94% to 19.10% per year.",
        "In the other events in which papers with terms of one year were negotiated, the average rates also moved downward, fluctuating between 20.35% and 19.44% per year.",
        "In the case of the secondary market, the National Treasury held two LTN purchase auctions with the objective of lessening the concentration of redemption volumes.",
        "These events were forecast in the schedule released at the end of the month of February.",
        "As part of the National Treasury’s efforts to create the conditions required for development of the secondary market for these papers, the third NTN-C offer was implemented in two stages on February 28 and 29.",
        "Total sales came to one million securities, of which 62% had three-year maturities and the remainder had seven-year maturities.",
        "The new format adopted for the auction in question made it possible for the liquidation percentage for securitized credits to reach 35.26% of the total sale of R$ 279 million, as compared to 25.84% in the previous event.",
        "The Central Bank operated on the open market on seven occasions spanning a period of 22 business days.",
        "All of these operations were designed to withdraw funding.",
        "The shift downward of the forward interest rate structure can be attributed to improvement in the internal scenario, particularly as regards inflation.",
        "On the day following the Copom meeting, February 17, the future interest rate curve was positive, with 18.75% per year, for the first maturity, and 19.25% per year for maturity in one year.",
        "On March 20, the inclination had turned negative: 18.64% per year and 18.22% per year, respectively.",
        "An analysis of supply and demand demonstrates that there are no significant imbalances capable of generating pressures of importance as regards the relevant horizon of the inflation target system.",
        "Consumption and credit indicators confirm the outlook for strong improvement during the course of 2000 but do not point to any risks for the balance of supply and demand and, therefore, cannot be considered a source of inflationary pressures.",
        "The austere fiscal policy has contributed positively to price stability and to reduction of the Brazil risk.",
        "The foreign sector, particularly the balance of trade, has evolved at a more favorable pace since December and has been marked by substantial improvement under exports, especially in volume terms.",
        "In these early months of 2000, foreign capital flows have confirmed improvement in foreign financing conditions.",
        "In much the same way, a careful analysis of the farm harvest reveals no expected pressures for the year.",
        "The overall framework is one of price stability, though the supply shock represented by the international oil price hike and increases in government-managed prices, forecast for the second and third quarters of the year, are risk factors that deserve careful analysis.",
        "Aside from these factors, due consideration should be given to the possibility of an increase in the value of the minimum wage coupled with delegation of authority to the states to define higher regional minimum wage parameters.",
        "The principal mechanism for monetary policy transmission to inflation is aggregate demand.",
        "The estimated lag between a change in interest rates and the impact of that change on price levels is between six and nine months.",
        "Thus, current policy will impact inflation in a way that will be perceptible only in the final quarter of the year.",
        "The monetary policy followed in the last six months was designed as an advance reaction to the increase expected in inflation in the two quarters of this year expected to be impacted by the aforementioned shocks, as well as to other factors considered to constitute risk to future inflation trends, such as the tendency toward increasingly more restrictive monetary policies in the major industrial economies.",
        "Though the possibility of a cutback in interest rates was considered possible, Copom decided to hold the Selic rate at 19% per year and indicate a downward bias.",
        "This prerogative is used when the level of uncertainty recommends adoption of a more flexible stance on the part of the monetary authority.",
        "In this case, the lessening of the uncertainties surrounding oil prices (the upcoming OPEC meeting) and a solution to the minimum wage question in the coming days should make it possible to create a more solid foundation for an interest rate cutback.",
        "At the close of the meeting, it was announced that, based on the Schedule of Ordinary COPOM Meetings, released by Banco Central Communiqué no.",
        "7,228, dated 01.19.2000, the Committee would meet again on April 18, 2000, at 3:00 PM, for technical presentations and on the following day, at 4:30 PM in order to discuss monetary policy guidelines.",
        "At the start of the third quarter of the year, aggregate demand indicators, stimulated by a greater supply of consumer credit and expanding exports, pointed to continuation of the growth trajectory.",
        "Sales of durable consumer goods and automobiles led this growth and were powered mostly by improved credit conditions.",
        "Investment indicators have expanded steadily.",
        "This growth was particularly strong under typically industrialized goods and transportation equipment and capital goods for the construction industry.",
        "Imports of capital goods have continued on a downward slide, though the negative results registered in terms of imported volume have been declining throughout the year.",
        "Fiscal results have clearly underscored the governments commitment to austerity and guarantied compliance with the targets defined in economic programming.",
        "While imports of fuels and lubricants expanded as a result of price growth, foreign purchases of raw materials were pressured by growth in the volume of imports.",
        "This performance reflects the process of growth in industrial output, particularly under foreign sales of manufactured goods.",
        "One should note that production of the latter has a high level of imported components.",
        "Aggregate supply indicators reveal that the growth process has continued, as the average level of utilization of installed capacity has expanded, new productivity gains have been achieved and industrial employment has turned upward.",
        "This forecast is below those issued previously.",
        "The decline in this case has been caused by adverse climatic factors that have impacted such winter crops as wheat and what is known as the intermediate corn harvest.",
        "The output level of durable goods, capital goods and semidurable and nondurable products is still well below the peak registered by the statistical series in July, indicating that there is still considerable idle production capacity available.",
        "With respect to the labor market, accumulated data up to July points to a growth trend under both employment and productivity, without generating pressure on production costs.",
        "In the month of July, formal employment expanded for the ninth consecutive month, with creation of 696 thousand job openings in the year.",
        "All sectors turned in expanded employment opportunities, with the sole exception of the construction industry.",
        "The most recent macroeconomic indicators released in the United States further reinforced signs of lesser growth in aggregate demand at the start of the second half of the year.",
        "In the case of Japan, more recent economic indicators point to deceleration in the pace of economic growth in relation to the expansion registered in the first half of the year.",
        "Insofar as the euro zone countries are concerned, the level of economic activity remained high in an environment marked by a gradual increase in the rate of inflation.",
        "The inflation high was caused by depreciation of the euro and increases in international petroleum prices.",
        "High oil prices and their excessive volatility have been caused by supply restrictions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporter Countries - OPEC, international economic growth, low stock levels in consumer nations and expectations of a seasonal increase in demand during the upcoming winter season in the northern hemisphere.",
        "The impact of farm price increases and changes in government managed prices exerted added pressures on August price indices, though these pressures were somewhat attenuated in relation to the month of July.",
        "Growth in farm prices was generated by adverse climatic factors that not only resulted in smaller than expected sugar cane and wheat harvests, but also provoked an early start to the meat and milk off-season period.",
        "In the case of sugar cane, the harvest failure increased pressures on fuel prices as a direct result of higher alcohol prices.",
        "Based on newly available information, both the shocks already identified and their impacts on the economy have been analyzed.",
        "An analysis of the various components of this subgrouping indicates that this is a temporary price shock and that its effects will be dissipated as of September.",
        "Despite this, the off-season agricultural period could have a marginal impact on inflation in the final quarter of the year.",
        "This shortage of both petroleum and derivatives could generate added pressures on current prices, despite the fact that the structure of futures prices indicates successive monthly declines.",
        "With respect to other government managed prices, just as had been expected, the most substantial pressure on inflation occurred in July and August.",
        "For the remainder of the year, the basic scenario incorporated the impact of public transportation fares in municipalities that had not yet authorized annual increases, as well as electricity rates in Rio de Janeiro.",
        "For 2001, the hypothesis is that public service rates will follow the growth trajectory estimated for the general indices used in the respective contracts and that other government managed prices will accompany the median level of the other prices of the economy.",
        "However, the effects of these shocks dissipated rapidly and, since they are clearly temporary in nature, provoked no significant alterations.",
        "Early figures for the month of September point to downward movement under inflation and would seem to confirm the lesser degree of inertia in price formation.",
        "With this, inflation projected for 2001 is slightly below the target.",
        "At the same time, in the alternative scenario which considers no additional increase in domestic fuel prices, the target for 2001 would be met with considerable ease.",
        "Leading indicators for inflation were presented together with short-term forecasts.",
        "IPCA core inflation was also presented.",
        "Pressures were somewhat attenuated as foodstuffs registered a lesser high, generating expectations of a downturn in the IPCA core in September.",
        "NBC-Es were offered on two separate occasions for purposes of partially rolling maturing exchange papers for which the National Treasury is liable.",
        "In order to regulate liquidity, Banco Central operated on seven different occasions on the secondary market, involving a total of 19 business days.",
        "In the secondary market, Banco Central carried out its second committed operation with no earmarking of the papers in question.",
        "The balance of supply and demand points to an absence of imbalances that would indicate any significant inflationary pressures on the horizon relevant to the system of inflation targeting.",
        "The pace of economic activity growth has remained solid and well within the parameters deemed compatible with price stability.",
        "Aggregate demand indicators are strong, with a greater supply of consumer credit and growth in exports.",
        "The highly positive fiscal result obtained during the course of the year confirmed the governments commitment to austerity and stands as a guaranty of compliance with the targets set down in the Economic Program.",
        "The fiscal situation has been steadily improving, as economic expansion has made it possible to increase inflows.",
        "At the same time as the confidence of economic agents in the Brazilian economy increases, it has become possible to gradually lengthen the maturities of public debt securities.",
        "Led by durable consumer goods and capital goods, industrial output has been expanding.",
        "One result has been an increase in average utilization of installed capacity.",
        "Labor market indicators point to growth in employment and productivity, with no significant impacts on production costs.",
        "The external scenario has gained in relative importance in terms of risk to the growth of the Brazilian economy, particularly in light of uncertainties surrounding petroleum prices.",
        "However, other international economic conditions would seem to be generally favorable to Brazil.",
        "More recent indicators reflect greater confidence in relation to the hypothesis of a smooth slowdown in the United States economy, at the same time in which futures markets would seem to discard any possibility of changes in American interest rates in the coming months.",
        "Growth perspectives seem to have improved for Japan and remain solid for the euro zone, despite the downturn in the value of the common currency.",
        "This situation will have a positive impact on Brazilian exports and contribute to improvement in perceptions of risk in the emerging nations in general.",
        "However, international oil prices are still climbing and their volatility is such that forecasting is a somewhat futile exercise.",
        "This highly adverse price shock has shown that it will be with us for some time to come and the probability of new highs will increase as winter in the northern hemisphere approaches.",

        "At the present time, inflation expectations (IPCA) for 2000 have moved below the mark of 6.5%, though they are still above the target.",
        "Another important indicator to illustrate this reversal is core inflation, which registered a decline in the first quarter of 2000 when compared to the final quarter of 1999.",
        "The drop in inflation occurred in the midst of negative supply shocks, such as occurred in the cases of public sector tariffs and oil prices.",
        "The rapid reversal in the trajectory of domestic prices in the midst of negative supply shocks suggests that there is space for a reduction in the interest rate level now in effect in the country.",
        "Copom’s position is that the current real rate of interest is not neutral or, in other words, it is above the real long-term equilibrium rate for the Brazilian economy.",
        "This perception was reinforced by projections for 2001 inflation, which were recently published in the Inflation Report (March 2000).",
        "Though current inflation and its expected trajectory are compatible with the predefined targets and fiscal results have proven to be highly positive, the preponderant position at Copom identified risks that should not be ignored, with uncertainties rooted in the following factors: the question of the value of the indexing of FGTS balances now being judged by the Federal Supreme Court; the recent behavior of international oil prices; and (iii) the external environment, with the increased volatility of international markets, expectations of higher interest rates in the United States and their impact on the Brazil risk premium.",

        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of inflation, but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer confidence.",
        "The reduction on the Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV, according to the same comparison basis, seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, and points to significant increase in the idle capacity margin of the manufacturing industry.",

        "In short, evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry reduced, although the ones regarding the utilization rates have increased in the last months.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The twelve-month cumulative trade balance retreated at the margin.",
        "The adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade surplus, but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite direction.",
        "The unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the US and Europe, using a wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary markets, have moderated the perception of systemic risk.",
        "In this environment, there have been signs of reduction in risk aversion, but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to reversals.",

        "However, the problems in the international financial system have continued to be aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit, focused on the US and Europe, which tends to reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of new intensification in the deceleration.",
        "In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer period, inflationary pressures have reduced rapidly.",
        "The disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging economies, in spite of greater persistence of the inflationary dynamics.",

        "At the same time, the authorities in the US, Western Europe and Asia have been announcing a series of important initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal incentives, which could contribute to a gradual economic recovery.",
        "Its important to notice, however, that the estimates on the fiscal costs for macroeconomic stimulus and support packages to the financial sector have been increasing, which has caused pressures over the risk assessment of several sovereign credits, even in advanced economies.",
        "The increasing signs that global economy would be close to an inflexion point, as well as the deterioration of public finance, have resulted in the elevation of interest rate forward structure in advanced mature economies.",
        "Future markets quotations also increased.",
        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging economies, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the rhythm of maturation of investments in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",

        "The pace of demand expansion has significantly cooled since the third quarter of 2008, partially as a reaction to the substantial and generalized economic activity deceleration in other developed and emerging economies.",
        "On its turn, the increase in risk aversion and the constraint observed in liquidity conditions prevailing in the international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments, but show some marginal improvements.",
        "However, it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in some emerging economies.",
        "Consequently, despite the recent increase in commodities prices, the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to be, until present, predominantly benign.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risk to the inflationary trajectory has diminished.",
        "The Committee evaluates that the materialization of such pass-through, as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over consumer prices, still depends critically on economic agents inflation expectations.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that, according to available data, domestic demand behavior should exert less pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Anyhow, the Committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "Such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened uncertainty.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the forward-looking inflationary path.",
        "In light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial conditions, credit contribution to sustain domestic demand severely diminished although there are some early signs of recovery, in particular regarding credit to individuals.",
        "The severity of the international crisis negatively influenced consumers and businessmen confidence, but there are also signs of recovery.",
        "Under such circumstances, the resumption of economic activity strongly depends on real payroll expansion and on the effects of government transfers that should occur in 2009, but it should also benefit from the gradual easing of financial conditions.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the final months of 2009 and, particularly in The Copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has caused an increase in the idleness margin of factors, resulting in reduction of inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario derive, on the short term, from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the past, as evidenced by the behavior in the price of services and regulated items since the beginning of 2009, as well as, if it persists, from the recent trend of increased commodities prices.",
        "In the medium-term, the risk to the inflationary trajectory stems from the cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing over the evolution of domestic demand in a context of gradual recovery of the utilization of production factors.",
        "The balance of those influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk premium, both for private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of signs of economic activity slowdown, regarding, for instance, industrial production indicators, labor market and industrial capacity utilization rates, as well as businessmen and consumers confidence, and of inflation expectations for relevant horizons, the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflationary scenario, in which the IPCA would resume evolution in line with the target path, have continued to consolidate.",
        "Regarding this issue, the evolution of the forward-looking scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the Committee, as well as on inflation expectations set by independent analysts.",
        "Therefore, despite the residual margin for an easing process, the monetary policy should maintain a cautious stance, aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Committee understands that the demand slowdown, motivated by tightening of financial conditions and by the deterioration of agents confidence, although some marginal improvement has been observed in both cases, as well as by the global economic activity contraction, has created a significant idleness margin of production factors that may not be rapidly eliminated in a scenario of gradual recovery of economic activity.",
        "Such development should contribute to restrain the inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom highlights that the significant monetary policy easing process that has been implemented since January, will have cumulative effects over the economy and will be evidenced after some time lag.",
        "The Committee evaluates that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment made since January, whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over time.",
        "In such context, a few Copom members considered to be appropriate, under such circumstances, to immediately reduce the pace of the monetary easing process, implementing in a more smooth way the remaining portion of the adjustment process.",
        "However, the majority of the Copom members, taking into account inflation projections, which have already incorporated the magnitude of the movement already made since January, decided, at this time, to maintain the adjustment pace unchanged.",
        "It bears noticing, on the other hand, that there was consensus among the Committee members, taking into account the information available so far, relative to estimates regarding the scope for residual easing, which depends on the prospective scenario for inflation in light of the targets path and on the balance of risks for such scenario.",
        "The Copom also understands that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will demand that the economy and financial system behavior under a different interest rate level should be closely monitored.",
        "Six votes in favor of the monetary policy action while two votes were in favor of reducing the Selic rate by 75 bps.",
        "Taking into account the fact that changes on the basic interest rate have effects over the economic activity and over the inflationary dynamics that accumulate over time, the Committee agrees that any additional monetary easing should be implemented in a more parsimonious way.",
        "Under the inflation targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections.",
        "After a long period of expansion, domestic demand started to exert a contractionist influence over economic activity, despite the persistence of incentive factors, such as income growth.",
        "Additionally, it bears highlighting that inflation expectations for 2009 and 2010 remain in a level consistent with the targets path.",
        "It is noteworthy that the deceleration of global economy has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial prices.",
        "Under such environment, the monetary policy could be significantly eased since January, without jeopardizing inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "If the risk profile deteriorates in such a manner that implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario considered by the Committee at this moment, the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the circumstances.",
        "It bears emphasizing the durable consumer goods production, particularly automobile vehicles production.",

        "The average tenure of corporate credit operations reached 273 days in April, down from 302 reached in December, while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled 491 days in April, up from 488 days observed in December.",
        "Regarding economic activity, the most recent data already suggest that the pace of global economic activity contraction has decreased.",
        "The US economic activity, for instance, has shown signs of stabilization in household consumption and in the housing market.",
        "Likewise, the process of inventories adjustment, particularly in the retail sector, has advanced, making room for production recovery in the near future.",
        "On the other hand, the recent hike in oil prices and the continuing rise in the rates of households savings and unemployment constitute risk factors for the recovery of consumption.",
        "The key issue for the medium term is whether the positive signs stemming from financial markets will find, indeed, sustainability in economic activity.",
        "In this sense, the ongoing deflationary process, for example, in the US, Japan and China, and the disinflation process, for example, in the UK and in most emerging economies, should still continue over 2009, due to the still uncertain recovery of economic activity and the fact that the prices of commodities, particularly oil, remain depressed when compared to the levels prevailing a year ago.",
        "In Japan, the deflationary process is expected to last for some quarters.",
        "In the period between the April and June Copom meetings, the future interest rates reduced significantly, especially short-term interest rates, reflecting the retreat in current inflation indices, the decline in inflation expectations and GDP growth projections.",
        "The medium- and long-term rates showed similar trend, also influenced by expectations of an extended monetary policy easing cycle and by an increasing financial inflow coming from foreign investors.",
        "After June 5, however, part of the downward movement of the curve was reversed, especially in its long segment, in reaction to the increase in the US Treasury bonds yield and the US dollar appreciation in the international market, noticeably after the disclosure of better-than-expected data on the US labor market.",
        "Between April 27 and June 8, one-, three- and six-month rates decreased by 82 bps, 74 bps and 71 bps, respectively.",
        "The one-, two- and three-year rates decreased by 64 bps, 48 bps and 30 bps, respectively.",

        "On May 5, the BCB carried out reverse FX swap auctions maturing on June 1, aiming to anticipate the redemption of the traditional FX swap contracts maturing on the same date.",
        "However, industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international crisis, due to its effects both over exports and credit conditions, and over business and households expectations.",
        "The future behavior of industrial production recovery, which should not be uniform over time, will depend on these factors, as well as on the gradual recovery of consumer and businessmen confidence, counterbalancing the deterioration of external demand.",
        "Labor market has continued to record ambiguous indicators, combining positive aspects with signs of loss of strength.",
        "The manufacturing industry showed positive balance for the third consecutive month.",

        "The agricultural sector showed the greatest dynamism, generating 57,169 jobs.",
        "After consecutive falls in the last months of 2008, expanded retail sales data have evidenced recovery, mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of vehicles, in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to some improvement in the access to vehicle credit supply.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of inflation, but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer confidence.",
        "The reduction on the Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV, according to the same comparison basis, seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, and points to significant idle capacity in the manufacturing industry.",
        "Regarding the absorption of capital goods, data indicate continuity of retraction year-over-year and expansion at the margin.",
        "In short, evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry reduced, although the ones regarding the utilization rates have increased in the last months.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "The twelve-month cumulative trade balance recovered at the margin.",
        "The adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade surplus, but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite direction.",
        "The unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the US and Europe, using a wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary markets, have continued to moderate the perception of systemic risk.",
        "In this environment, there have been signs of reduction in risk aversion, but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to reversals.",
        "Anyway, the decreasing trend of risk aversion and scarcity of capital flows, as well as some concern about the fiscal situation in the US, continued to encourage the recovery of currencies, both from emerging and mature economies, against the US dollar.",
        "Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures.",
        "However, there are evidences that economic activity in G3 could be stabilizing, with signs of resilience in consumption in the US and recovery of manufacturing activity in Germany and Japan.",
        "On the other hand, the problems in the international financial system might continue to be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit, focused on the US and Europe, which could reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of new intensification in the deceleration.",
        "In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer period, inflationary pressures reduced rapidly.",
        "The disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging economies, in spite of greater persistence of the inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this context, monetary policies stances have become highly expansionist and focused on non-traditional instruments in the mature economies, while the expansionist stance in the emerging economies has been more moderate.",
        "At the same time, the authorities in the US, Western Europe and Asia announced a series of important initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal incentives, which can contribute to a gradual economic recovery.",
        "Its important to notice, however, that the estimates on the fiscal costs for macroeconomic stimulus and support packages to the financial sector are high, which has caused pressures over the risk assessment of several sovereign credits, even in advanced economies.",
        "The accumulation of signs showing that global economy could be close to an inflexion point, as well as the deterioration of public finance, have resulted in the elevation of interest rate forward structure in advanced mature economies.",
        "However, future markets quotations decreased.",
        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging economies, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the pace of investments maturation in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, or through the transportation costs for industry, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Under the market scenario, inflation projection for 2010 increased, but remains close to target.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "The risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments, but show significant easing at the margin.",
        "However, it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in some emerging economies.",
        "Consequently, despite the increase in commodities prices since early 2009, the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to be, until present, predominantly benign.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may impose risks to the inflationary trajectory is limited.",
        "The Committee evaluates, however, that the materialization of such pass-through, as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over consumer prices, still depends critically on economic agents inflation expectations.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that, according to available data, the behavior of domestic demand should exert less pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Anyhow, the Committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "Such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened uncertainty.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the forward-looking inflationary path.",
        "In light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial conditions, credit contribution to sustain domestic demand has diminished although signs of recovery cumulate, in particular regarding credit loans to individuals.",
        "The severity of the international crisis influenced negatively consumers and businessmen confidence, but in this case there are also more consistent signs of recovery.",
        "Under such circumstances, the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll expansion and on the effect of governmental transfers that will occur in 2009, and it should also benefit from the gradual easing of financial conditions.",
        "In short, the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation, mentioned in previous Copom meetings minutes, that the contractionary effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism and, consequently, over the context on which the monetary policy operates, could become persistent, but wouldnt be permanent.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have impacts concentrated in the final months of 2009 and, particularly in The Copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has caused an increase in the idleness margin of factors utilization, resulting in reduction of inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario derive, on the short term, from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the past, as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and regulated items since the beginning of 2009, as well as from a possible increase in commodities prices.",
        "In the medium-term, the risk stems from the cumulative and lagged effects, from the financial conditions easing over the evolution of domestic demand, taking into account the dynamics of consumption and investment, in a context of recovery of production factors utilization.",
        "The balance of those influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates leads to the increase of risk premium, for both private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the increase of the idleness margin of the economy relative, in particular, to the industrial capacity utilization rates and labor market indicators, as well as to the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant horizons, the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflation scenario, in which the IPCA would resume evolution in line with the target path, have remained favorable.",
        "Such evolution of the forward-looking scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the Committee, as well as on inflation expectations set by independent analysts.",
        "Under such circumstances, in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflation scenario, under a macroeconomic scenario with significant uncertainty, the Copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious stance, aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Committee understands that the demand accommodation, motivated by tightening of financial conditions and by the deterioration of agents confidence, although marginal improvements continue to be observed, as well as by the global economic activity contraction, which could also be cooling, has created significant idleness margin of production factors, which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Copom also emphasizes that uncertainties around such basic scenario remain, with positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity recovery.",
        "Anyhow, such development, contemplated under the basic scenario, should contribute to restrain inflationary pressures.",

        "The Copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require that the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates be closely monitored over time.",
        "Taking into account the fact that monetary policy easing implemented since January has lagged and cumulative effects over the economy, the committee evaluates, at the present moment, that this level of basic interest rates is consistent with a benign inflationary scenario, contributing to ensure the inflation convergence to targets path over the relevant time horizon, as well as to the non-inflationary recovery of economic activity.",

        "Under such circumstances, the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll expansion, on the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and on incremental governmental transfers, which will occur in the upcoming months.",
        "It should also benefit from the easing of financial conditions.",
        "In short, the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous Copom meetings minutes that the contractionist effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism and, consequently, over the context on which the monetary policy operates, could become persistent, but would not be permanent.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have concentrated impacts in The Copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism that occurred at the end of 2008 caused an increase in the idleness margin of production factors utilization, resulting in reduction of inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario derive, on the short term, from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the past, as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and certain regulated items since the beginning of 2009, as well as from a possible hike in commodities prices.",
        "On the medium term, the risk stems from cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and from the fiscal stimulus over the evolution of domestic demand, taking into account the dynamics of consumption and investment, in a context of recovery of production factors utilization.",
        "The balance of such influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, for both private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation remains in a level consistent with the target path in 2009, 2010 and Such strategy, which should have its results evidenced throughout time, takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the idleness margin of the economy, and the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant horizons, the materialization of a benign inflation scenario, in which the IPCA would continue to evolve according to the target path, has remained favorable.",
        "By the way, such evolution of the forwardlooking scenario continues to be reflected on the inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "Under such circumstances, in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflationary path, under a macroeconomic scenario with significant uncertainty, the Copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious stance, aiming to assure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "The Committee understands that the accommodation of demand, motivated by the tightening of financial conditions and by deterioration of the agents confidence, as well as by the global economic activity contraction, could have been overcome, although significant idleness margin of production factors still persists, which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Copom also highlights that there are uncertainties around such basic scenario, which should be clarified over the upcoming months, with both positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity recovery.",
        "Anyhow, under such scenario of gradual recovery, which has been corroborated by current available data, inflationary pressures should remain restrained.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee notices that the significant monetary policy easing, implemented between January and July, will have cumulative effects over the economy, which will be evidenced with a time lag.",
        "The Committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment carried out between January and July, whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over time, in a context of gradual recovery of production factors utilization.",
        "The Copom also understands that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future and, therefore, to the consistent recovery of the economy over the upcoming quarters.",
        "The Copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates to be closely monitored over time.",
        "Taking into account, on the one hand, the monetary policy easing implemented since January and, on the other hand, the idleness margin of production factors, among other factors, the Committee evaluates that such level of basic interest rate is consistent with a benign inflationary scenario, contributing to assure the maintenance of inflation in line with the targets path over the relevant horizon for the non-inflationary recovery of economic activity.",
        "Under the inflation targeting regime, the Copom guides the decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections.",
        "After a short period of contraction, domestic demand started to show signs of recovery, due to the stimulus factors effects, such as income growth.",
        "Additionally, it bears noticing that, evidencing the credibility achieved by the Copom on the implementation of the regime, inflation expectations for 2010 and 2011 remain in line with the targets path.",
        "It is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial prices.",
        "On its turn, important monetary and fiscal stimuli were introduced into the economy over the last quarters and should contribute to the activity recovery and, consequently, to the reduction of the idleness margin of production factors.",
        "Those stimuli effects should be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy decisions, which should ensure the materialization of the convergence to targets path over relevant horizons, will be taken.",

        "Domestically, the release of improved data for the labor market, the increase of GDP growth projections, concerns with a possible reduction in the fiscal restriction and the expectation of a tax creation over foreign capital inflows contributed to this movement.",
        "In the international scenario, the improvement of some US economic indicators and the decision of the Central Bank of Australia to increase its basic interest rate, being the first monetary authority to take this decision since the beginning of the crisis, have also influenced the upward movement of the yield curve.",

        "The recovery, at the margin, in the dynamism of industrial production, led by production of the durable goods, reflects, predominantly, tax exemption measures and also some easing of credit conditions.",

        "After consecutive falls in the last months of 2008, expanded retail sales data have evidenced recovery, mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of vehicles, in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to some improvement in the access to vehicle credit supply.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of inflation, but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer confidence.",
        "Considering the monthly series without seasonal adjustment, in June the Nuci was 3.4 p.p.",
        "The reduction on the Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV, according to the same comparison basis, seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, and points to significant idle capacity in the manufacturing industry.",

        "The unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the US and Europe, using a wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary markets, have continued to moderate the perception of systemic risk.",
        "In this environment, there have been signs of reduction in risk aversion, but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to reversals.",
        "Anyway, the decreasing trend of risk aversion and scarcity of capital flows, as well as some concern about the fiscal situation in the US, continued to encourage the recovery of currencies, both from emerging and mature economies, against the US dollar.",
        "Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures, but recovery of economic activity seems to have begun.",
        "However, there are evidences that economic activity in G3 could be stabilizing, with signs of improvements in industrial activity and stabilization in real estate market in the US, recovery of manufacturing activity and business confidence in Germany and industrial recovery in Japan.",
        "On the other hand, the problems in the international financial system might continue to be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit, focused on the US and Europe, which could reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions and, as a consequence, hinder the consolidation of economic recovery.",

        "In this context, after a period of aggressive monetary policy easing, in a significant number of countries, monetary policy seems to have entered into a stability phase, while the increase in public sector debt imposes limits on the scope of any additional fiscal stimulus.",
        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, in the context of global economic recovery, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the pace of investments maturation in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, or through the transportation costs for industry, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",

        "The risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity condition prevailing in international markets continue to show significant easing at the margin.",
        "However, it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in some emerging economies.",
        "Consequently, despite the increase in commodities prices since early 2009, the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to be, until present, predominantly benign.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized pressures may impose risk to the inflationary trajectory is limited.",
        "The moderation of domestic demand pressures over the market of factors, despite remaining subject to uncertainties, should contain the risk of pass-through of upward pressures stemming from wholesale prices.",
        "The Committee, however, evaluates that the materialization of such pass-through, as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over the consumer prices still depends critically on economic agents inflation expectations.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that the behavior of domestic demand should exert less pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Anyhow, the Committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",

        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the supplys reaction to stimuli stemming from previous changes on relative prices and on the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic environment.",
        "Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which continued quite robust until the third quarter of 2008, and was at least partially responsible for the inflationary pressures, has considerably lost momentum since then.",
        "This deceleration is partly a result of a substantial and generalized cooling of economy activity on both emerging and G-8 economies.",
        "On its turn, the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments.",
        "In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects, which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant uncertainty.",
        "On the one hand, the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets, and consequently, depreciating their prices.",
        "On the other hand, the more generalized economic deceleration in the last months, which may persist in the upcoming quarters, has caused the cooling of both commodities prices and external demand, and has also negatively impacted local financial conditions.",
        "Moreover, the trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of inflationary external pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in some emerging economies.",
        "As a consequence, the net effect of the global deceleration over the inflation trajectory seems to be, so far, predominantly benign.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory diminished.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that, according to data available, domestic demand should exert lesser pressures over the prices of nontradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",
        "In this context, the Copom reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices.",
        "This point of view is even more important in periods of higher uncertainty.",
        "It is particularly important to notice, the effects of the international crisis over domestic financial conditions have resulted in severe decline of the credit contribution to support domestic demand.",
        "Additionally, the intensification of the international crisis has caused a negative effect on consumers and businessmen confidence.",
        "If this situation persists, the strength of economic activity will increasingly depend on payroll expansion and on the effects of governmental transfers expected for These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the upcoming quarters.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the loss of strength on domestic demand should result in reduction of inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, the remaining risks for the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of Brazilian assets prices, amidst a process of decreasing external sources of funding and mechanisms of price adjustments that contribute to prolong inflationary pressures observed last year.",
        "The balance of those influences over the prospective trajectory of inflation will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk premiums, shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "Indeed, the evolution of the prospective scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "The Copom also understands that demand deceleration has reduced the pressure over supply conditions observed in most of 2008, which should significantly contribute to deflate the economy.",
        "Still, monetary policy should be cautiously conducted, aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets path, despite some scope for an easing process.",
        "The Committee believes that the consolidation of restrictive financial conditions for a longer period should exert in significant contraction effect over demand and, throughout time, a relevant deflation pressure.",
        "Under such circumstances, the majority of the Copom members, taking into account the balance of risks for economic activity and, consequently, for the prospective inflation scenario, as well as the absence of clear evidence of effects over inflation stemming from the depreciation of the exchange rate, in an environment of global reduction of inflationary pressures, has decided, at this moment, to reduce the Selic rate by 100 bps.",
        "Other Copom members evaluate that, in light of the presence of inflationary feedback mechanisms in the economy, as well as the consequences of the balance of payments adjusting process, a more moderate reduction of the Selic rate would represent a more consistent signal of the prospective trend of inflation convergence to the targets path and would be more adequate to an optimal pace of the easing process.",
        "Five votes were in favor of this monetary policy action while three were in favor of reducing the Selic rate by 75bps.",
        "With such action, the Committee has initiates a process of monetary policy easing, immediately accomplishing significant part of the Selic rate movement, without harming the commitment to the inflation target.",
        "Under the inflation targeting regime, the Committee guides its decisions according to projected inflation, analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking prices dynamics, and the balance of risks associated to their projections.",
        "There are signs that, after a long expansion period, domestic demand has started to have a contraction influence over economic activity, despite persistence of incentive factors, such as income growth.",
        "On the other hand, the strong global economy deceleration has resulted in downward pressures over wholesale prices, despite the exchange rate adjustment.",
        "In such environment, monetary policy can be more flexible without putting at risk inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "Evidently, if deterioration on the risk profile implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario, considered by the Committee at this moment, the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the circumstances.",
        "The agricultural IPA behavior strongly contributed to this scenario.",
        "Still according to the FGV, businessmen confidence in the industrial sector declined in December, similarly to the observed in the previous three months.",

        "The current economic and financial conditions have implied a decline in consumption and deterioration of business and consumer expectations, impacting negatively production, investment and real GDP, outlining the most severe economic reversal since The recession in United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Australia, among others; the dramatic decline in the installed capacity utilization verified globally; and the retraction in international trade are responsible for the deepening in the decline in the prices of commodities, oil in particular.",
        "This fact, added up to the deepening of the non-functionality in the financial systems, has evidenced the need of anti-cyclical fiscal policies.",
        "In this sense, new packages of fiscal stimulus, preferentially directed to expenditures in infrastructure and tax reduction, were released in the US, Japan, China, Germany, Spain, France and UK, among others.",
        "This behavior was mainly driven by the fall in the current and expected inflation and by the released indicators that signaled the reduction of the expansion pace of economic activity, negatively impacting in the labor market.",
        "Between December 8 and January 19, one-, three-, and six-month rates decreased by 51 bps, 87 bps and 141 bps, respectively.",

        "However, industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international outlook, by business and households expectations, as well as by the developments of domestic financial conditions, supported by traditional sources of credit, besides the recovery of capital markets and the performance of financial public institutions.",
        "The recovery, at the margin, in the dynamism of industrial production, led by production of durable goods, although more widespread than before, reflects, to a great extension, tax exemption measures and also some easing in credit conditions.",
        "The future behavior of industrial production recovery, which should not be uniform over time, will depend on these factors, as well as on the evolution of consumer and businessmen confidence, counterbalancing the still emerging recovery of external demand.",

        "Since the beginning of the year, expanded retail sales data have evidenced recovery, mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable, in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to the improvement in the access to credit supply.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the inflation behavior, but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply, influenced by the lagged effects of monetary policy and by the evolution of consumer confidence.",
        "The reduction on the Nuci, according to the same comparison basis, results from a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, but more recent data suggest that idle margin has been reducing.",

        "The unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in mature economies, using a wide range of instruments, have continued to moderate the perception of systemic risk, in an environment of strong liquidity expansion.",
        "Under these conditions the signs of reduction in risk aversion continue, as evidenced by the behavior of international equity markets, although this process remains subject to reversals.",
        "The trend of reduction of risk aversion and of the scarcity of capital flows, as well as some concern among investors about the fiscal situation in the US, continued to encourage the recovery of currencies, both from emerging and mature economies, against the US dollar, yet in a more modest and heterogeneous terms in relation to the movement observed in previous months.",
        "Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures in 2009, but recovery of economic activity seems to have been consolidating.",
        "However, there are evidences of gradual recovery in the economic activity, but still subject to reversals, particularly due to the weakness in the labor market and economic activity in G3.",
        "On the other hand, the risks that the problems of the international financial system may be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration of the credit quality, which could contain the distension of financial conditions, and consequently, difficulty the consolidation of recovery, persist, but seem to be slowing.",
        "Therefore, the minimal points of inflation in mature economies seem to have been exceeded, despite the persistence, on a twelve-month trailing basis, of the disinflation process in several emerging economies.",
        "In this context, after a period of aggressive monetary policy easing, in a significant number of countries, monetary policy seems to have begun a phase of stability, whereas the increase in public sector debt imposes limits on the scope of any additional fiscal stimuli.",
        "Future markets did not show a consistent trend as well.",
        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, in the context of global economic recovery, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the pace of investment maturation in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",

        "Consequently, the impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path continues to be, up to now, predominantly benign.",
        "On its turn, the possible consolidation of the world economy recovery might impact, although in a heterogeneous fashion, the global inflationary dynamics.",
        "On the top of this, it should be added the uncertainty generated by the effects of the unprecedented liquidity expansion on mature economies, over the price behavior of both assets and commodities.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized pressures impose risks to the inflationary trajectory remains limited.",
        "The Committee understands that the materialization of such pass-through, as well as the generalization of pressures, initially localized over the consumer prices, still depends critically on economic agents inflation expectations.",
        "Incidentally, inflation expectations for 2010 and 2011 remain in line with the targets path and continue to be closely monitored.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noticing that the domestic demand behavior tends to exert contained pressure over nontradable items, such as services, over the upcoming quarters.",
        "Nonetheless, the Committee reaffirms that it will conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation figures.",
        "Such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened uncertainty.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the forward-looking inflationary path.",
        "Signs of credit recovery continue to accumulate, in particular regarding loans to individuals.",
        "Also for consumer and businessmen confidence there are consistent signs of recovery.",
        "Under such circumstances, the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll expansion, on the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and on incremental governmental transfers, which will occur in the upcoming months.",
        "It should also benefit from the easing of financial conditions, favored by the policy of official banks, among other factors.",
        "In short, the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous Copom meetings minutes that the contractionist effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism and, consequently, over the context on which the monetary policy operates, could become persistent, but would not be permanent.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have concentrated impacts in The Copom understands that the risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario derive, in the short term, from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the past, as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and certain regulated items since the beginning of 2009, as well as from a possible hike in commodities prices.",
        "In the medium term, the risk stems from cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and from the fiscal stimulus over the evolution of domestic demand, taking into account the dynamics of consumption and investment, in a context of recovery of production factors utilization.",
        "The balance of such influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, for both private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure that that the convergence of inflation towards the target path observed in 2009 continues to be registered in 2010 and Such strategy, which results have been evidenced throughout time, takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, in light of the idleness margin of the economy, evidenced by indicators of capacity utilization in industry and of the labor market, and the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant horizons, the materialization of a benign inflation scenario, in which the IPCA would continue to evolve according to the target path, has remained favorable.",
        "By the way, such evolution of the forward-looking scenario continues to be reflected on the inflation projections considered by the Committee.",
        "Under such circumstances, in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflationary path, under a macroeconomic scenario with significant uncertainty, the Copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious stance, aiming to assure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path.",
        "The Committee understands that the accommodation of demand, motivated by the tightening of financial conditions and by deterioration of the agents confidence, as well as by the global economic activity contraction, has been overcome, although significant idleness margin of production factors still persists, which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Copom also highlights that there are uncertainties around such basic scenario, which should be clarified over the upcoming months, with both positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity recovery.",
        "Anyhow, under such scenario of gradual recovery, which has been corroborated by current available data, inflationary pressures should remain restrained.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee notices that the significant monetary policy easing, implemented between January and July, will have cumulative effects over the economy, which will be evidenced with a time lag.",
        "The Committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the stimuli introduced into the economy, whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over time, in a context of a gradual and consistent recovery of production factors utilization.",
        "The Copom also understands that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future and, therefore, to the consistent recovery of the economy over the upcoming quarters.",
        "The Copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates to be closely monitored over time.",
        "Taking into account, on the one hand, the monetary policy easing implemented since January and, on the other hand, the idleness margin of production factors, among other factors, the Committee evaluates that such level of basic interest rate is now consistent with a benign inflationary scenario, contributing to assure the maintenance of inflation in line with the targets path over the relevant horizon for the non-inflationary recovery of economic activity.",
        "Under the inflation targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections.",
        "After a short period of contraction, domestic demand started to show signs of recovery, due to the stimulus factors effects, such as income growth.",
        "Additionally, it bears noticing that, evidencing the credibility achieved by the Copom on the implementation of the regime, inflation expectations for 2010 and 2011 remain in line with the targets path.",
        "It is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial prices.",
        "On its turn, important monetary, credit, and fiscal stimuli were introduced into the economy over the last quarters and should contribute to the activity recovery and, consequently, to the reduction of the idleness margin of production factors.",
        "Those stimuli effects should be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy decisions, which should ensure the materialization of the convergence of inflation to targets path over relevant horizons, will be taken.",

        "Despite the announcement of the debt restructuring of the Dubai World Sovereign Wealth Fund, which led, more recently, to an increased risk aversion, in general, international financial markets showed relative stability during the period.",
        "In this environment, most central banks kept unchanged their basic interest rates.",
        "In the opposite direction, in the United Kingdom, Japan and Russia, central banks increased the local monetary loosening, respectively through increasing the value of direct purchases of assets, by additional injection of liquidity and through the continuous reduction of basic interest rates.",
        "The release of betterthan-expected data for the economic activity and labor market, and current inflation higher than expectations contributed to this movement.",
        "Between October 19 and December 7, one- three- and six-month rates increased by 0.01 bps, 0.03 bps and 0.17 bps, respectively, whereas one- two- and three-year rates increased by 0.20 bps, 0.10 bps and 0.14 bps, respectively.",

        "Data released for the last months point, in short, to the interruption of the industrial production expansion cycle since the last quarter of The industrial activity has been influenced by the international crisis, due to its effects both over exports and credit conditions, and over business and households expectations.",
        "In this context, several industrial segments have been led to adjust inventories and reduce production, a process that has recently been particularly evident in the intermediate goods industry.",
        "The recent slowdown in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business confidence.",
        "On its turn, the cooling in the pace of expansion of durable goods production reflects, predominantly, the tightening in credit conditions, the deterioration of consumer expectations and the process of inventories reduction mentioned above.",

        "After falls in October, November and December, expanded retail sales data for January and February should evidence a recovery influenced mainly by the increase in the sales of vehicles, in response to the sector incentives granted by the government.",
        "For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of inflation, but it will also be affected by the evolution in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer confidence.",
        "The reduction on Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic activity, and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing industry.",
        "On the other hand, recent data about the absorption of capital goods indicate continuity in the slowdown of investments.",
        "In short, evidences so far suggest an ongoing process of reduction in demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry.",

        "The contraction of international liquidity has continued to contribute to a process of deleverage by asset managers, which, in turn, has been pressuring down the prices of financial assets.",
        "In an environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital flows, the volatility of emerging economies currencies remains present, despite not showing the generalized trend of depreciation against the US dollar observed in the last months of Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures.",
        "The predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in 2009, recovering just in The consensual projections point to an intense retraction of activity in US, Europe and Japan, which wouldnt be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging economies, especially in Asia.",
        "There are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in Europe and parts of Asia was in a significant manner due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices in 2008, which was reverted, allowing an increase in available income in these regions.",
        "On the other hand, the problems in the international financial system have continued to be aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit, focused on the US and Europe, which tends to reinforce the contraction in financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of intensification in the deceleration.",
        "In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has considerably decelerated, inflationary pressures have reduced rapidly.",
        "In emerging economies, where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more intense, inflationary pressures have also been declining, although they show, in many cases, more persistence.",
        "In this context, while the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature economies, in emerging economies, which, in addition to the facts already mentioned, have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation trend, the expansionist stance has been more moderate.",
        "At the same time, the authorities in US, Western Europe and Asia have been announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal incentives, which could contribute to a gradual economic recovery.",

        "Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the prospects for evolution of global supply, in a scenario of uncertainties regarding the implementation and maturation of investments in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, the main scenario adopted by the Copom, which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in 2009, remains plausible.",
        "However, with the persistence of the current scenario in the oil market, it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis of price reductions in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the reduction in international oil prices observed since the second half of 2008 can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",

        "Therefore, in general terms, the influence of the external scenario over the future path of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to apparently contradictory effects, which can act with distinct intensity throughout time, surrounded by significant uncertainty.",
        "On the one hand, the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets and consequently, depreciating their prices.",
        "On the other hand, the more generalized economic deceleration observed in the last months which, despite not permanent, may persist in the upcoming quarters, has caused the cooling of both commodities prices and external demand, also negatively impacting local financial conditions.",

        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts over the upcoming quarters.",

        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment level; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2010 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "As a consequence of the stabilization and correction of unbalances, which determined important structural changes, the process of maturing of the inflation targets stands at advanced stage, and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary policy.",
        "Evidences under this respect can be observed, among other factors, through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six years, at the same time that real interest rates have reduced.",
        "Progress in the financial markets structure, the FX and inflationary risk premium reduction, among other factors, seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral rate.",
        "From another point-of-view, some of these developments, combined to others, such as the extension of contract tenures, also suggest that the power of monetary policy in Brazil has increased in the last years.",
        "Despite recognizing that a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables, the Copom considers that the most pessimist estimates regarding the current level of neutral interest rate tend, with significant probability, not to find support in fundamentals.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "Concerns about European countries sovereign debt and the deceleration in China remain elevated, while the worries regarding the sustainability of the US economy recovery increased.",
        "Even so, the prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets increased and, overall, prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable.",
        "Meanwhile, the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant economies, whereas prospects of deflation in other economies remain.",
        "In this context, the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation remains high, although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "Prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable, at a less intense rhythm than the observed at the start of the year, as evidenced by data on trade, inventories and industrial production, among others.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs of a more moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate; by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, but with some accommodation at the margin; and by the recent trajectory of inventories in some industrial sectors.",
        "The Copom considers, on the other hand, that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited, among other factors, by the vigor of labor market, by the remaining effects of fiscal impulses and of policies of public banks and, at a magnitude lower than previously expected, by the global activity.",
        "The Copom considers important to emphasize, once more, that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current and past inflation figures.",
        "This assessment finds support, for instance, in the significant reduction of analysts projections for the Selic rate, without resulting in unfavorable changes in the median of inflation projections, which, in fact, have substantially reduced for 2010 and increased only marginally for Moreover, regarding the forwardlooking scenario, it is fundamental to highlight that there was retreat in the values projected for inflation by the BCB.",
        "Despite recognizing the existence of risks of inflation increase in the short run, the Copom considers that the convergence of inflation to the midpoint target tends to materialize.",
        "For that, it finds support in the pertinent consideration that monetary policy acts with time lags over activity and inflation, and that the effects of the adjustment process in the basic interest rate initiated in April 2010 havent completely materialized.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee ensures that, in case this scenario does not promptly materialize, the monetary policy stance should be adjusted in order to guarantee the convergence between the pace of demand and supply expansions.",
        "From another point-of-view, in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the CMN, monetary policy should act in order to redirect price dynamics and, therefore, ensure the target to be fulfilled.",
        "The intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and Brazilian economies have undergone in recent years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective scenario.",
        "The Committee recognizes an economic environment where uncertainty stands above the usual and the remaining risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem from the domestic outlook.",
        "For instance, it bears highlighting those deriving from domestic demand expansion, in a context of narrow idleness margin in the use of production factors.",
        "Evidences of this fact come from the real wages gains in some segments and higher pressures on production prices in the recent past.",
        "It is plausible to affirm, however, that the factors that support these domestic risks have decelerated.",
        "For example, there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to long-term equilibrium and, therefore, the effects of demand pressures and the high level of utilization of the factors on the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool down.",
        "Another contributing factor for that, in the same period, was the higher probability of deceleration, and even reversion, of the already slow process of recovery of G3 economies.",
        "As a consequence, the influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation behavior shows a disinflationary bias.",
        "Domestic demand is robust, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "Moreover, although they tend to cool, fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and still should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion and, hence, for the maintenance of the idleness margin of factors at low levels.",
        "The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, by those referring to the significant worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the monetary policy stance change.",
        "These elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "It can be emphasized that, according to this comparison basis, all segments decelerated, relative to July.",
        "The three IPCA-15 core inflation measures cooled down in August.",
        "The IPCA segmentation shows that the stability in the last two months stemmed mainly from the decreases in the prices of food and beverages, which have offset the positive contributions of the other segments.",
        "Despite the stability of the last two results, it should be noted that the decrease in the prices of food and beverages in the period cooled down, which can affect the pattern of the index in the next months.",
        "The three IPCA core inflation measures decelerated, in July, month-on-month.",
        "Economic Activity The IBC-Br showed stability in June, month-on-month, considering seasonally adjusted data.",

        "The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates reached 452 days, up from 448 days in June.",
        "External Environment Data for the second quarter GDP in the US, Japan and China confirmed the deceleration of the global economic activity growth pace.",
        "High frequency recent indicators have corroborated the prospects of maintenance of this deceleration process.",
        "In Europe, although the fiscal affairs remain as an important source of concern, the economic environment has improved, driven by the favorable results of the stress tests applied in the European banks.",
        "In the period, the dollar reached a record low against the yen in fifteen years, and the 10-year government securities yields of the main developed economies fell, with the Germany securities reaching a record low for the historical series.",
        "The G3 central banks kept the accommodative stance of their monetary policies, while the Fed is reinvesting the fund obtained from mortgages backed redemptions in long-term treasuries.",
        "In fact, this process of delay on the normalization of monetary policy has been verified in the major part of mature and emerging economies.",
        "The drivers of this movement were, regarding the domestic outlook, the disclosure of inflation figures in line with market expectations and of data signaling economic activity accommodation.",
        "Regarding the foreign outlook, signals of cooling in the US economic activity recovery and in global economy dynamism originated a global movement of interest rate drop, boosting the foreign investment flow to domestic interest rate markets, which contributed to the long-term interest rate fall.",
        "The one-, two-, and three-year rates decreased by 0.31 p.p., 0.38 p.p.",
        "and 0.54 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB also borrowed money through 31 overnight repo operations and conducted daily two-working-day tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "The net issuance of securities by the National Treasury and the federal government net revenues were the main drivers of the liquidity contraction in the period.",
        "The three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB showed convergent behavior between April and May.",
        "It is important highlighting that all core inflation measures, on a twelve-month basis, are above the midpoint of inflation target.",

        "This process is supported not only by traditional sources of credit, but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial institutions.",
        "The recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable goods, but it has become even more widespread than before, reflecting tax exemption measures, in advanced process of reversion, as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income expansion.",
        "The future behavior of industrial production, which should not be uniform over time, will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen confidence, which should continue to be sources of dynamism, to which shall be added the gradual recovery of external demand.",
        "Labor market continues to show vigor in clear process of expansion in the economic cycle.",
        "In fact, 305 thousand jobs were created in April and 962 thousand in the year through April.",
        "Expanded retail sales data have been evidencing growth, mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable goods, in response to the improvement in the access to credit, income expansion and temporary sector incentives granted by the government.",
        "The retail sector continues to register positive performance and indicates that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust, but might, however, show some signs of cooling.",
        "For the next months, it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by fiscal transfers, by real payroll growth, by the recovery in the access to credit and by the evolution of consumer confidence.",
        "The trend of reduction in the idle capacity is the result of economic activity expansion, not totally offset by the maturity of investment projects.",
        "In short, evidences suggest that the utilization rates have recorded upward trajectory in the last months, showing reduction in any remaining idle margin of the industry, despite the recovery of investments.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "In fact, the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of the trade surplus.",
        "Apparently, the perception of systemic risk resurfaced, fueled by the view that there would be interdependence between a possible fiscal consolidation in economies that are facing difficulties in this area and the balance sheets of financial institutions.",
        "However, until now, the possibility of realization of a stress scenario seems limited, but, anyway, there was some moderation in demand for risky assets in international financial markets.",
        "The U.S. economy shows signs of recovery, as can be seen, for example, at the end of the process of rebuilding of inventories, with positive impact on industrial activity and retail sales, although these indicators show some volatility.",
        "The levels of consumer confidence also advanced, although remaining at levels well below those prevailing before the crisis of Moreover, the labor market begins to show signs of recovery.",
        "On its turn, the economic activity in Japan continues to suggest a slow recovery, led by exports.",
        "In the Euro Area, fiscal concerns turn the recovery more uncertain, the household consumption shows no consistent signs of reaction, and the economic recovery tends to be slower and uneven.",
        "On the other hand, in many emerging economies, economic activity remains in a path of expansion, showing, in some cases, evidence of heat in the markets of goods, services, production factors and assets.",
        "In fact, there is already concern about the dynamics of inflation in major emerging economies.",
        "In this context, after a period of aggressive monetary policy easing, monetary policy continues unchanged in several countries, and in those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis, which had recovered more quickly and intensely, the adoption of more restrictive monetary policy has started.",
        "In fact, the uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, in a context of asymmetric global economic recovery, on major uncertainties about the recovery of the European economy, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the pace of investment maturation in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices might affect domestic prices both through production chains, such as the petrochemical, and through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",
        "Furthermore, measures to reduce liquidity in China may have an effect on commodity prices.",
        "On the other hand, iron ore, an important input in the production chain of the industrial sector, has shown significant increase in price, although there was a reduction in May.",

        "In line with greater risk aversion and more scarce liquidity, the prices of some selected commodities and Brazilian assets decreased.",
        "On another front, the trajectory of price indices evidences inflationary pressures in relevant economies.",
        "In this context, the influence of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path is more ambiguous, although uncertainty persists about the behavior of asset prices and commodities in the context of the worsening international financial conditions.",
        "The Copom assesses that this scenario can deteriorate, depending on the dynamics that derives from the market distrust regarding the solvency of some European economies, but, on the other hand, recognizes that this is not the baseline scenario considered.",
        "Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "In this context, the risk of pass-through of upward costs pressures to wholesale price inflation, and from these to consumer price inflation, increases as well.",
        "The Committee states that the materialization of these pass-throughs, as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer prices, continues to depend critically on the economic agents expectations for inflation and on the idleness degree of the economy, among other factors.",
        "Therefore, these and other variables are part of the information set that is taken into account in the generation of inflation forecasts by the BCB, which constitute a key element in the Committees assessment on the prospective inflation scenario.",
        "Additionally, it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand has exerted some pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, which, considering the prospects for the evolution of the main factors sustaining aggregate demand, may continue.",
        "In any event, the Committee reaffirms the commitment that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom considers important to emphasize, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current and past inflation figures.",
        "Prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable, as evidenced by data on trade, manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor market.",
        "This assessment is also supported by signs of continued expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate; by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels; and by income growth.",
        "The dynamism of domestic activity should also be benefited, among other factors, by fiscal impulses, the policies of official banks and, to a lesser extent, the pace of recovery in global activity.",
        "Considering the Brazilian economys new cycle of expansion, these considerations become even more relevant when one takes into account that there are lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over the activity level and inflation.",
        "The Copom believes that the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem mainly from the domestic side, for example, those resulting from the expansion of domestic demand in the context of virtual exhaustion of the idleness margin in the use of production factors.",
        "Incidentally, evidences of narrowing of the market factors are the acceleration of real wage gains in the recent past in some segments and higher producer price pressures.",
        "Indeed, these developments may exacerbate an outlook that already evidences the presence of mismatch between the growth of domestic absorption and capacity of supply expansion.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment level; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2010 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "Signs of overheat in the economy are evidenced, for example, in core inflation trajectories, in the behavior of inflation expectations, in the evidence of workers shortage and in the rising inputs costs.",
        "In particular, during this period, the inflation projections considered by the Committee showed slight deterioration in the prospective scenario.",
        "The Copom believes that this deterioration should be contained and, therefore, the signs of persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand expansion and aggregate supply, which, ultimately, tend to increase the risk for inflation dynamics, must be reversed.",
        "In such circumstances, the monetary policy stance should be adjusted, on the one hand, because it contributes to the convergence between the pace of demand expansion and supply and, on the other hand, because it prevents that originally localized price pressures determine a persistent deterioration of the inflation prospective scenario.",
        "On the other hand, it is worth noting that in that same period, external developments have introduced a certain amount of caution in the analysis of the prospective scenario.",
        "Anyway, the prevailing opinion among the Committee members was that monetary policy should be adjusted incisively in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer horizons.",
        "Under the inflation-targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections.",
        "Domestic demand appears robust, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit resumption.",
        "Moreover, fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion and, hence, for the reduction of any residual idleness margin of productive factors.",
        "The effects of these stimuli, however, counter the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, and a possible deepening of the fiscal crisis that several European countries face.",
        "These elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "In addition, it bears noticing that there was consensus among the Committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation scenario, as well as to the corresponding balance of risks, in order to limit the impacts caused by the behavior of current inflation over the underlying prices dynamics.",
        "The variations of the three core measures accelerated, in May, month-on-month and year-over-year.",

        "In the euro area, domestic consumption remains fragile, and the expansion of economic activity over the first quarter was due to the positive contribution of inventories.",
        "In this context, the central banks of G-3 retained the accommodative monetary policies stance.",
        "The persistence of high unemployment and idle production factors in conjunction with anchored inflation expectations should help to maintain this accommodative stance for a longer period of time than had been anticipated.",
        "The two concepts were equal due to the full payment of borrowing operations in foreign currencies in May.",
        "The short-term rates increased influenced by the disclosure of activity data suggesting consistent recovery of the Brazilian economy and expectations of inflation above the targeted path.",

        "The greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of trade surplus.",
        "These developments can be attributed to some reduction in the concerns regarding fiscal deterioration in some mature economies, notably in Europe, despite the beginning of the reversal of the strong liquidity expansion occurred in 2009, notwithstanding the remaining high degree of uncertainty.",
        "Under these conditions, there was some recovery in the demand for risky assets, as evidenced by the behavior of international financial markets.",
        "Moreover, in face of fiscal concerns, the focus in the currency market was the depreciation of euro against other currencies.",
        "The US economy recorded robust growth in the last quarter of 2009, sustained by the recovery of inventories, and the labor market performance showed some improvement.",

        "So, it bears emphasizing that the prospects for foreign funding of Brazilian economy remain favorable.",
        "On the other hand, the trajectory of price indices evidences the resumption of external inflationary pressures.",
        "Consequently, the benign impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path could come to an end, in light of the persistence of uncertainty regarding the behavior of asset and commodities prices in the context of gradual normalization of international financial conditions.",
        "The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom believes that, with the confirmation of the incipient evidences of intensification of domestic demand pressures over the market of factors, the probability that initially localized inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation trajectory increases.",
        "In this context, the risk of pass-through of wholesale price upward pressures to consumer prices increases as well.",
        "The Committee judges that the materialization of this pass-through, as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer prices, continues to depend critically on the economic agents expectations for inflation and on the idleness degree of the economy, among other factors.",
        "Therefore, these and other variables are part of the information that is taken into account in the generation of the inflation forecasts of the BCB, which constitute a central element in the Committees assessment on the prospective inflation scenario.",
        "Additionally, it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand tends to exert some pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",

        "The Copom considers important to emphasize, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",

        "Under these circumstances, the pace of activity depends significantly upon the evolution of real earnings, the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the increments of governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming months.",
        "The dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial conditions, favored, among other factors, by the policies of official banks.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have more impacts from the middle of 2010 on.",
        "The Copom believes that the main risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem, regarding the external outlook, from a possible rise in commodity prices and, regarding the domestic scenario, from the cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and the fiscal and credit impulse over the evolution of domestic demand, taking into account the dynamics of consumption and investment, in the context of the rapid reduction in the idleness margin in the use of production factors.",
        "The balance of these influences on the future trajectory of inflation will be crucial for the assessment of the different monetary policy stances.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, for both private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",

        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Committee considers that the accommodation of demand, driven by the tightening of financial conditions and the deterioration of the agents confidence, as well as by the contraction of the global economy, was overcome.",
        "Therefore, it is reasonable to affirm that the economy is already in an expansion cycle, while there is still uncertainty to be resolved over time about the pace of this process.",
        "Under this scenario, which is supported by the data available so far, monetary policy must ensure inflationary pressures remain contained.",
        "In short, the Committee evaluates that, given the signs of strength in domestic demand, resulting in the reduction in the idleness margin of the production factors, as evidenced by indicators of manufacturing capacity utilization and labor market, and by the recent behavior of inflation expectations, the risks to the achievement of a benign inflationary scenario, in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets, have increased.",
        "Under this environment, monetary policy should remain especially vigilant in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer horizons.",
        "In light of these considerations, there was consensus among committee members about the need to implement an adjustment in the basic interest rate, in order to contain the gap between the pace of domestic demand and productive capacity, as well as to strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.",

        "After a brief contraction, domestic demand recovered, largely thanks to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit resumption.",
        "On its turn, important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should contribute for the consolidation of activity resumption and hence, for the reduction of any residual idleness margin of productive factors.",
        "The effects of these stimuli will be an important part of the context in which future decisions on monetary policy, which must ensure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path in 2010 and 2011, will be taken.",
        "In addition, it bears noticing that there was also consensus among the Committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation scenario, as well as to the corresponding balance of risks, in order to limit the impacts caused by the behavior of current inflation over the underlying prices dynamics.",

        "As the recovery is still fragile, particularly in mature economies, these central banks have kept the focus on liquidity management, including the closure of programs to increase the liquidity created during the crisis, avoiding, now, an increase in the basic interest rate.",
        "Among the central banks of emerging economies, the People's Bank of China raised again the reserve requirements, a process also undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India, while the monetary authority of Malaysia surprised by increasing the interest rate, similar to the action taken again by the Reserve Bank of Australia.",
        "In the short-term component of the yield curve, the successive upward revisions in inflation expectations, the disclosure of higher price indices and activity data and employment data, suggesting a consistent recovery of the economy, contributed to this movement.",

        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "In fact, the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of the trade surplus.",

        "The Copom believes that, if the prospect of intensification of demand pressures over the domestic market of factors is confirmed, the probability that initially located inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation trajectory could be rising.",
        "In this context, the risk of pass-through of possible wholesale price upward pressures to consumer prices would increase.",
        "The Committee judges that the materialization of this pass-through, as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer prices, continues to depend critically on the economic agents' expectations for inflation.",
        "Additionally, it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand could exert some pressure over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters.",
        "In any event, the Committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent.",
        "The Copom considers important to emphasize, once more, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation figures.",
        "The Committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the forward-looking inflationary path.",
        "Prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable, as evidenced by data on trade, manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor market, and by signs of continued expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate.",
        "Consumer and business confidence also show consistent signs of recovery.",
        "Under these circumstances, the pace of activity depends significantly upon the evolution of real earnings, the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the increments of governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming months.",
        "The dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial conditions, favored, among other factors, by the policies of official banks.",
        "These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have more impacts from the middle of 2010 on.",
        "The Copom believes that the main risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario derive, regarding the external outlook, from a possible rise in commodity prices and, regarding the domestic scenario, from the cumulative and lagged effects of the financial condition easing and the fiscal and credit impulse over the evolution of domestic demand, taking into account the dynamics of consumption and investment, in the context of the reduction in the idleness margin in the use of production factors.",
        "The balance of these influences on the future trajectory of inflation will be crucial for the assessment of the different monetary policy stances.",
        "International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, for both private and public funding, to the shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure that the convergence of inflation towards the targets path observed in 2009 continues to be registered in 2010 and Such strategy, whose results have been evidenced throughout time, takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "The Committee considers that the accommodation of demand, driven by the tightening of financial conditions and the deterioration of the agents confidence, as well as by the contraction of the global economy, shows persistent signs of having been overcome, despite the persistence of uncertainty, which should be resolved over time, towards positive and negative outlooks for the pace of economic recovery.",
        "Anyway, under this scenario of recovery, which is supported by the data available so far, monetary policy must ensure inflationary pressures remain contained.",
        "In short, the Committee judges that, given the signs of recovery in domestic demand, resulting in the reduction in the idleness margin of the production factors, as evidenced by indicators of manufacturing capacity utilization and labor market, and by the recent behavior of inflation expectations, the risks to the achievement of a benign inflationary scenario, in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets, can increase.",
        "Under this environment, monetary policy should remain especially vigilant in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer horizons.",
        "Under the inflation targeting regime, the Copom guides its decisions according to projected inflation, the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking dynamics for prices, and the balance of risks associated to the projections.",
        "After a brief contraction, domestic demand has recovered, largely thanks to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit resumption.",
        "On its turn, important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should contribute to consolidating the resumption of activity and hence, to reduce the residual idleness margin of productive factors.",
        "The effects of these stimuli should be carefully monitored over time and will be an important part of the context in which future decisions on monetary policy, which must ensure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path in 2010 and 2011, will be taken.",
        "In the event that the risk profile deteriorates so that it implies changes to the inflation prospective scenario considered this time by the Committee, the monetary policy strategy will promptly be adapted to the circumstances.",

        "The average tenure of corporate credit operations reached 283 days, while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled 520 days.",
        "Global Economy The sustained recovery of the US economic growth and the maintenance of economic vigor presented by the emerging economies, particularly in the BRIC countries and in Southeast Asia, are signs of continued global economic recovery in In contrast to this perspective, it bears highlighting the evidence of new stagnation in Germany and deepening of fiscal difficulties in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, as well as weak domestic demand in Japan.",
        "In these economies, where inflation does not constitute relevant risk in the short- and medium-term, monetary authorities have kept interest rates unchanged.",
        "The release of improved data for economic activity and the labor market, the announcement of higher-than-expected inflation rates and the increase of market projections for 2010 GDP growth contributed to this movement.",
        "The BCB also borrowed money through 34 overnight repo operations and conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "The main determinant factor of the liquidity expansion in the period was the net redemption of securities by the National Treasury.",
        "The volatility of food prices performed a fundamental role in the behavior of 2010 headline inflation.",
        "This behavior of food price inflation partially mirrored domestic and external supply shocks, whose impacts were possibly heightened by the high volatility environment in international financial markets.",
        "For the last four-month period, the most likely scenario indicates the continuity of this dynamics, with elevation of the headline inflation mainly determined by the increase in food prices.",
        "In line with the evolution of headline inflation, the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB increased between August and September.",
        "GDP growth reflected, to great extent, statistical carry over, which, in general, was observed in the demand components and supply subsectors.",
        "After registering positive growth rates in all months of 2009 until April 2010, the IBCBr has shown stability in the last months.",
        "Industrial activity has partially been supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial institutions.",
        "The future behavior of industrial production will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen confidence, which should continue to be additional source of dynamism.",
        "All ten sectors surveyed increased month-on-month in August.",
        "In the next months it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by governmental transfers, by real payroll growth, by credit expansion and by consumer confidence.",
        "Therefore, evidence suggests that the utilization rates have accommodated at high levels, and that the maintenance of the reduced idleness margin is the result of the recent economic activity expansion, still not totally offset by the maturity of completed and ongoing investment projects.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "In fact, the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade surplus.",
        "The global economy recovery continues to be led by a group of emerging countries, whose steady pace of economic expansion is anchored mainly by domestic demand.",
        "The possibility of eventual reversion in this recovery process cannot be completely discarded, though.",
        "The US economic activity data indicate a scenario of gradual recovery from the crisis, but at a more moderate pace of growth than that recorded in the first quarter.",
        "Consumer confidence in the US reached a new record low and the signs of relevant idleness margin persist, not only in the American economy, but also in the Euro Area and in Japan.",
        "Regarding inflation rates, they have remained at very low levels in the G3 countries, despite the extremely expansionist economic policy actions, both at the fiscal and at the monetary sides.",
        "Finally, the possibility that also the US adopts new expansionist monetary policy actions has contributed for the acceleration of the devaluation process of the US dollar that had been observed in the last months.",
        "Among emerging markets, it bears highlighting that the Chinese central bank increased its interest rate after a long period of stability.",
        "The low predictability of the asymmetric rebound of global economy, the dependence of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and the geopolitical complexity of the sector add uncertainty to oil prices forecasts.",
        "Nonetheless, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, oil prices swings might affect the domestic economy, for example, through the petrochemical sector or through expectations chains.",
        "Regarding agricultural commodities, their prices continued to record increases, with highlights for sugar, cotton and corn.",
        "Industrial commodities prices have also increased.",
        "These price increases may be explained by price movements of important currencies and commodities global demand growth.",
        "On its turn, the volatility observed in commodities prices results from a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and FX markets volatility is high.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Regarding the third quarter of 2012, in both scenarios, the projection is around the inflation midpoint target.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic environment.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation-targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the price dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, and help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, mainly price setters.",
        "It is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment level; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the Copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2010 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "As a consequence of the stabilization and correction of unbalances, which determined important structural changes, the process of maturing of the inflation targets stands at advanced stage, and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary policy.",
        "Evidences under this respect can be observed, among other factors, through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six years, at the same time that real interest rates have reduced.",
        "Progress in the financial markets structure, the FX and inflationary risk premium reduction, among other factors, seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral rate.",
        "From another point-of-view, some of these developments, combined to others, such as the extension of contract tenures, also suggest that the power of monetary policy in Brazil has increased in the last years.",
        "Despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables, it should be emphasized that this perception is supported by estimates generated by macroeconometric models used by the Copom.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "Concerns about European countries sovereign debt and the deceleration in China remain elevated, as well as about the sustainability of the US economy recovery.",
        "Even so, the prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets increased and, overall, prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable.",
        "Meanwhile, the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant economies, whereas concerns regarding the prospects of deflation in other economies remain.",
        "In this context, the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation remains high, although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms its view that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "Although the accommodation observed in the last two quarters has been more intense than expected at the start of the year, as evidenced, among others, by data on inventories and industrial production, the prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable.",
        "This assessment is supported, among other factors, by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, despite at a more moderate pace, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom considers, additionally, that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor market, despite the cooling in the generation of jobs in specific segments.",
        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current and past inflation figures.",
        "The prospective scenario substantially deteriorated early this year, but this dynamic has reversed, greatly mirroring less favorable prospects for global activity and the monetary policy actions implemented this year.",
        "Despite the difficulty in identifying the nature of these shocks, and their intensity, duration and the possibility of reversal, monetary policy should act to prevent its propagation, the so-called second-order effects.",
        "However, the prevailing view is that the convergence of inflation to the midpoint target tends to materialize.",
        "For that, the Copom finds support in the pertinent considerations that monetary policy acts with time lags over activity and inflation, and that the effects of the adjustment process in the base interest rate initiated in April 2010 havent completely materialized yet.",
        "Moreover, it is worth noticing that this hypothesis of convergence is subject to the materialization of the trajectories regarding fiscal and credit variables which the Committee considers.",
        "Anyway, the Committee ensures that, in case this scenario does not promptly materialize, the monetary policy stance should be adjusted in order to guarantee the convergence between the pace of demand and supply expansions.",
        "From another point-of-view, in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the CMN, monetary policy will act in order to redirect price dynamics and, therefore, ensure the target to be fulfilled.",
        "The intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and Brazilian economies have undergone in recent years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective scenario.",
        "Evidence in this respect are manifested, for example, in the bimodal character of analysts view polled by the BCB, as some participants perceive a benign inflation scenario, in which the Selic rate would remain stable in the relevant horizon, while other participants show skepticism and advocate the base rate.",
        "On its turn, the Committee recognizes an economic environment in which the uncertainty level prevails above the usual, where the remaining risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem from the domestic outlook.",
        "For instance, it bears highlighting those deriving from domestic demand expansion, in a context of narrow idleness margin in the use of production factors.",
        "In this context, it seems plausible to affirm that the factors that support these domestic risks have decelerated.",
        "Moreover, there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to long-term equilibrium and, therefore, the effects of demand pressures and of the high level of utilization of factors over the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool down.",
        "Still, the current balance of risks still points to the accomplishment of a benign scenario, in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets path, which is largely due to the adjustment of the base rate implemented since April.",
        "Also contributing to this scenario is the new information released since then, indicating an improvement in the balance of risks related to the regulated prices dynamics, as well as that the slowdown of economic activity in the last two quarters was more intense than the projected at the start of the year.",
        "Regarding the external outlook, the probability of deceleration, and even reversion, of the already slow process of recovery of G3 economies remains high.",
        "As a consequence, the influence of the international scenario over domestic inflation behavior shows some disinflationary bias.",
        "Domestic demand is robust, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "Moreover, although they tend to cool down, fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should still contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion and, hence, for the maintenance of the idleness margin of factors at low levels.",
        "The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, by those referring to the worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the change in the monetary policy stance.",
        "These elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The changes in the three IPCA core inflation measures have accelerated in September month-on-month.",
        "The main drivers of wholesale prices were corn, contributing 0.34 p.p.",
        "; cattle, 0.22 p.p.",
        "; and poultry 0.17 p.p.",
        "In the last two months, there was decrease in optimism about the industry at present and recovery in relation to the future situation.",
        "In the last twelve months through September, 2,263.9 thousand formal jobs were created in the country.",
        "The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates, increased in August, reaching 457 days, up from 452 days in July.",
        "Despite this bias, as the mature economies continue to present significant output gap, price indices are tamed.",
        "In the emerging economies, despite some basic interest rate rises, as occurred in Peru, Chile and India, the monetary policy stance continues to support economic growth, as central banks have maintained the basic interest rates below the levels observed prior to the beginning of the crisis, with the perception that it will be necessary to continue to delay the withdrawal of monetary stimuli introduced during that period.",
        "The VIX index retreated to twenty-point level, standing close to the values recorded at the end of April, before the fiscal crisis deepening in European countries.",
        "The one- and three-year rates decreased by 0.08 p.p., and 0.01 p.p., respectively, while the two-year rate increased by 0.03 p.p.",
        "The BCB also borrowed money through 33 overnight repo operations and conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "The main drivers of liquidity expansion in the period were the BCB interventions in the FX market, the net expenses of the Union and the net redemption of federal public securities.",
        "In short, information available confirms deterioration of inflation dynamics at the start of 2010, but, on the other hand, there was marked improvement at the margin.",
        "The three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB showed convergent behavior between May and June.",
        "Moreover, it bears highlighting the decrease at the margin of the IPCA-15 in July, for both core measures and the diffusion index.",
        "Under this comparison basis, the acceleration of the IGP-DI reflected the behavior of its three components.",
        "The IPA-DI inflation acceleration, under this comparison basis, derived both from the behavior of agricultural and industrial prices.",
        "Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the dynamics of wholesale prices improved at the margin, particularly the agricultural prices.",
        "Furthermore, the Copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend, among other factors, on the current and prospective demand conditions, the exposure of each sector to foreign and domestic competition, as well as on the price setters expectations for the future inflation path.",
        "The evolution of the IBC-Br, as well as other indicators of activity, suggests that the economy may have entered a path more consistent with economic growth rates evaluated as sustainable in the long term, rather than those observed in the first quarter of the year.",
        "The behavior of the industrial output and its components remained stable around the levels prevailing prior to the crisis.",
        "In the first months of this year, the buoyant pace in industrial activity has been influenced by the international outlook, the businesses and households expectations, as well as by domestic financial conditions, which have boosted domestic demand.",
        "This process was also supported by the rebuilding of inventories and the anticipation of consumption, which, on its turn, partially resulted from the prospects of fiscal stimulus withdrawal.",
        "Despite the stability on a month-on-month basis observed in May, the behavior of IBGE industrial output series and its components returned levels observed in the pre-crisis period.",
        "This process has been supported not only by traditional sources of credit, but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial institutions.",
        "After the crisis, the recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable goods, but it became widespread afterwards, reflecting tax exemption measures, in advanced process of reversion, as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income expansion.",
        "The future behavior of industrial production will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen confidence, which should continue to be sources of dynamism, among other factors.",
        "After decreasing substantially after the crisis, the unemployment rate has shown some stability.",
        "Expanded retail sales data have been evidencing growth, mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable goods, in response to the improvement in the access to credit, income expansion and temporary sector incentives granted by the government.",
        "The retail sector indicates that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust and, therefore, it continues to register positive trend, although recent figures suggest some cooling.",
        "For the next months, it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by governmental transfers, by real payroll growth, by credit expansion and by consumer confidence.",
        "The reduced idle capacity is the result of economic activity expansion, not totally offset by the maturity of investment projects.",
        "Furthermore, data regarding the absorption of capital goods show recovery year-over-year.",
        "In short, evidences suggest that the utilization rates have accommodated at high levels, despite the recovery of investments.",
        "As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand conditions.",
        "In fact, the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade surplus.",
        "The US economy shows signs of recovery, but in an ambiguous way and at a slower pace than previously anticipated.",
        "In fact, consumer confidence remains at levels below those prevailing prior to the crisis, and although the labor market shows some improvement, unemployment remains at a high level and should retreat slowly, which is common in after-crisis periods.",
        "Recent indicators suggest loss of strength in the US economy, which could be attributed to effects of higher than expected anticipation of consumption.",
        "On its turn, the Japanese economy cannot overcome deflation and recovers at a slow pace, led by exports.",
        "Recent data on consumption recorded negative rates for Japan and also for the Euro Area.",
        "In fact, the recovery in this region, besides being slow and uneven across the economies of the Euro, is very uncertain, partly due to the fiscal consolidation and the difficulties experienced by the credit market.",
        "In short, the uncertainty regarding the sustainability and pace of economic expansion in mature economies increased, mainly in the US and Europe, in a scenario where economic policy stimuli are replaced by contraction measures.",
        "As the economies of the G3 show high idleness for the production factors, a process exacerbated by fiscal concerns, central banks maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In this context, after a period of aggressive easing, monetary policy continues unchanged in several countries, but in those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis, which recovered more quickly and intensely, the adoption of more restrictive monetary policy stance continues.",
        "Despite the lower volatility in this period, the uncertainty concerning the quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, in a context of asymmetric global economic recovery, on major uncertainties about the recovery of the European economy, on the prospects for the evolution of global supply, subject to the pace of investment maturation in the sector, in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity.",
        "Nonetheless, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices might affect domestic prices both through production chains, such as the petrochemical, and through the potential effect over inflation expectations.",

        "Besides the persistent concerns about the sovereign debt in European countries, uncertainties about the sustainability of the US economy recovery and evidences of deceleration in China have arisen.",
        "Even so, the prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets increased and overall prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable.",
        "Meanwhile, the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant economies, whereas prospects of deflation in other economies resurfaced.",
        "In this context, the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation increased, although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved.",
        "The Copom considers important to emphasize, once more, that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current and past inflation figures.",
        "In this regard, it bears highlighting that there was significant decrease in the dispersion of headline inflation expectations for both 2010 and 2011, and for market prices inflation expectations the most sensitive component, and which more quickly responds to monetary policy actions.",
        "Prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable, at a less intense rhythm than the observed at the start of the year, as evidenced by data on trade, inventories and industrial production, among others.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs of a more moderate expansion of credit supply, especially for individuals; by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, but with some accommodation at the margin; and by the recent trajectory of inventories in some industrial sectors.",
        "Anyway, the dynamism of domestic activity should continue to be benefited, among other factors, by the remaining effects of fiscal impulses, by the policies of official banks and, at a magnitude lower than previously expected, by the global activity, which presents signs of moderation.",
        "The Copom considers that this process shall be intensified and, therefore, the signs of the persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand and supply expansion shall be reverted, because they tend to increase the risk for the inflationary dynamics.",
        "In this sense, monetary policy stance should be adjusted, once this action contributes for the convergence between expansion paces of demand and supply.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate.",

        "Despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables, it should be emphasized that this perception is supported by estimates generated by the macroeconometric models used by the Copom.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "The prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets remained relatively stable and, overall, prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable.",

        "Regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook evolve, the Copom reaffirms its view that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years be preserved.",
        "Although the accommodation observed in the last two quarters has been more intense than the expected at the start of the year, as evidenced, among others, by data on inventories and industrial production, the prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain favorable.",

        "The Copom emphasizes, once more, that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and inflation.",
        "Therefore, the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflationary scenario and its risks, instead of current and past inflation figures.",

        "However, these two sets of instruments cannot be seen as perfect substitutes, once they diverge, among other aspects, regarding scope and transmission mechanisms.",
        "The macroprudential actions recently announced are inserted in a wider process, which includes, among other aims, the reversion of stimuli introduced to outweigh the effects of the crisis over the Brazilian economy.",
        "Together with other measures, they constitute a sequence of initiatives that aim to adequate domestic financial conditions to the after-crisis scenario, characterized by intense contrast among the prospective scenarios for the main economic blocks.",
        "The intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and Brazilian economies have undergone in the last years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective scenario.",
        "The Committee recognizes an economic environment in which the uncertainty level prevails above the usual, where the risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario essentially stem from the domestic outlook.",
        "On the other hand, these liquidity eases evidence the ambiguous influence of the international scenario over domestic inflation behavior.",
        "Regarding the domestic outlook, the effects of Selic rate adjustments have not been totally incorporated into price dynamics.",
        "Additionally, recently announced macroprudential measures, a quick and powerful instrument to contain localized demand pressures, will still have their effects incorporated to price dynamics.",
        "Although the uncertainties that surround the global scenario, and at a lower scale, the domestic scenario, do not allow the clear identification of the lastingness of the recent pressures, the current balance of risks is less favorable to the materialization of a benign scenario, in which inflation would consistently follow the targets trajectory.",
        "Domestic demand is robust, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",

        "According to the baseline scenario, which uses the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus survey, the inflation projections are near the upper bound of the tolerance interval in 2021, and around the target in The Committee pondered that despite the recent approval of important reforms, which will bring benefits in the medium term, the fiscal risks remain high in the short term due to the worsening of the pandemic, which implies an upward bias to these projections.",
        "This asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus, justifying a trajectory with a larger initial increase in the policy rate than that implied by the baseline scenario.",
        "The Committee also highlighted that the delay in the normalization of the production chains, which puts pressure on production costs and inflation in specific sectors, suggests that there is also a positive demand shock at work.",

        "The Copom members discussed the impact of this asymmetry in the balance of risks in the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus.",
        "In particular, some members questioned whether it would still be appropriate to maintain an extraordinarily high degree of stimulus, given the normalization of the economic activity observed in recent months.",
        "Therefore, these members believe that the Copom should consider starting a process of partial normalization, reducing the \"extraordinary\" degree of monetary stimuli.",

        "The same would occur in the case of changes in the balance of risks that result in a lower probability of an increase in risk _premia and_ consequent increase in prospective inflation.",
        "On the other hand, evolution of the economy in line with the Copom's baseline scenario, the more consistent recovery of economic activity, and a worsening of the global outlook would favor the interruption of the easing process.",
        "In this context, the members of the Committee discussed the level of flexibility to be maintained in the communication on the next step for monetary policy.",
        "Some members expressed a preference for a high level of flexibility, favoring more symmetric communication about the next step, while others proposed to signal more strongly the possible interruption of the monetary easing cycle and to maintain freedom of action, but to a lesser extent.",

        "In this environment, risks to global financial stability, of fiscal and financial nature, increased, among other factors, due to exposure of international banks to sovereign debt of countries with fiscal imbalances, especially in the Euro Area.",
        "From another perspective, high persistent unemployment rates, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, as well as limited scope for monetary policy actions, have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in advanced countries or even of their potential growth, indicating a wider and more volatile business cycle.",
        "There has also been reduction in growth projections for major emerging economies.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances, in specific cases, with new non-conventional initiatives in the field of monetary policy.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, the bias of monetary policy is expansionary.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",

        "For 2013Q3, projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and above, in the market scenario.",
        "In the main scenario considered by the Copom, projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in This scenario was developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that broadly identify the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the Brazilian economy - among others, the channels of trade, the price of imports and the external volatility.",
        "As a working hypothesis, it considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the Brazilian economy equivalent to one quarter of the impact observed during the international crisis.",

        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low 5 risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increas in risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for houseeholds and companies.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment growth; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path, which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "As a consequence of the stabilization and correction of unbalances, which determined important structural changes, the inflation targeting regime maturing process stands at an advanced stage, and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary policy.",

        "Progress in the financial markets structure, the reduction of both FX and inflationary risk premia, among other factors, seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral rate.",
        "From another point-of-view, some of these developments, combined to others, such as the extension of contract tenures, also suggest that the power of monetary policy in Brazil has been increasing in the last years, despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the monetary policy traction increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "The Committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain high.",
        "It also notes that, in these economies, there seems to be limited scope for using monetary policy, and a scenario of fiscal restraint also prevails.",
        "In addition, for the main emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity has moderated, in part, a consequence of policy actions and weakening external demand through the trade channel.",
        "Therefore, the Committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant horizon.",
        "For the Copom, there has been accumulated evidence supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy can be realized through many channels, among others, the reduction of total trade flows, the moderation in investment inflows, tighter credit conditions and the worsening in consumer and business confidence.",
        "The Committee understands that the complexity surrounding the international environment will contribute to intensify and accelerate the ongoing moderation in domestic activity, which is already mirrored, for instance, in the retreat of growth projections for the Brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming year.",
        "In other words, the ongoing moderation process of the economy - a result of the policy actions implemented since the end of last year - tends to be boosted by the weakness of the global economy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is observed, prospects for economic activity are still favorable.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that, despite showing some cooling, point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom considers, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that accumulated inflation in the twelve months peaked in the last quarter, and it begins to retreat in the current quarter, therefore, moving towards the target path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that, by itself, this reversion of trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic agents about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming quarters, especially those of the price setters.",
        "Additionally, the Committee believes that this improved perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the pace of both domestic and external economic activity, in this and in the upcoming semesters.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the trend in the reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "It bears highlighting that, since the beginning of this year, important decisions have been taken and implemented, which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is underway.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit market expansion, for which macroprudential and conventional monetary policy actions recently adopted contribute.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, at the start of the year, inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply shocks, as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments.",
        "Although in decreasing intensity, these developments should also indirectly impact the dynamics of consumer prices, through inertia, among other mechanisms.",
        "At the same time, it evaluates, as relevant, despite decreasing, the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "Moreover, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market.",
        "Despite signs of moderation in this market, considers that in such circumstances, a very important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the longterm trend, or is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain price pressures.",
        "The Committee also observes that, at the end of last year and at the start of this year, the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory were key to the prospective scenario.",
        "However, since April these prices have retreated in international markets.",
        "The Copom notes that, according to the main scenario, the inflation rate stands around the target in 2012 and identifies decreasing risks to the confirmation of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint target.",
        "Domestic demand is still robust, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "However, recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures.",
        "Other important factors to curb domestic demand are the substantial deterioration of the international scenario and the macroprudential actions implemented.",
        "These elements and 7 the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",

        "All five measures increased in the twelve months through September, compared to the twelve months through August.",
        "The monthly result was mainly driven by the increase in the price of food products, which contributed 0.66 p.p..",
        "The result reflected the retractions of 1.3 p.p., 0.6 p.p.",
        "in durable consumer goods, non-durable consumer goods and intermediate goods, respectively; the increase of 0.3 p.p.",

        "European debt market development continues to be determinant for the financial market evolution.",
        "Following financial market observed trend, commodities prices partially recovered in the first two weeks of October.",
        "However, commodities prices reduction, specially energetic and agricultural ones, has not reversed the inflationary trend observed in the last months in the main developed economies.",
        "At the same time, these monetary authorities expanded their liquidity provision measures to their banking systems.",
        "The BoE increased it assets acquisition program by 75 billion, to 275 billion, and the BoJ extended the deadline to the adhesion and the effective period of easing of eligibility conditions for the participation in the program of funds provision to the institutions located in calamitous areas.",
        "In the domestic scenario, this movement was influenced by the expectation of monetary easing cycle that started in August and by the release of data signaling accommodation in the activity level.",
        "Regarding the external outlook, the increase in uncertainties stemming from the developments of European countries debt crisis, the release of economic indicators weaker than expected in the main economies and the reduction in commodities prices also contributed to the fall in interest rates.",

        "The main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in Regarding the prices of other commodities, it is noteworthy the increase in the agricultural international prices.",
        "In recent past, the high volatility observed in commodities prices seems to have been strongly impacted by the abundant global liquidity, in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to the remarkable volatility in FX markets.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available information.",
        "For 2012, the projection stands above the midpoint target in the benchmark scenario and around the target in the market scenario.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation-targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, mainly price setters.",
        "It is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate.",
        "Consequently, high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth potential, in addition to presenting regressive effects on income distribution.",
        "Moreover, high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment level; on the contrary, they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long terms.",
        "Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2011 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected.",
        "Such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation.",
        "As a consequence of the stabilization and correction of unbalances, which determined important structural changes, the process of maturing of the inflation target regime stands at an advanced stage, and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary policy.",
        "Evidences under this respect can be observed, among other factors, through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven years, at the same time that real interest rates have reduced.",
        "Progress in the financial markets structure, the FX and the inflationary risk premiums reduction, among other factors, seem to have determined in significant reduction of the neutral rate.",
        "From another point-of-view, some of these developments, combined to others, such as the extension of contract tenures, also suggest that the power of monetary policy in Brazil has increased in the last years, despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "Prices of relevant commodities grew, without movements, in the opposite direction, of domestic assets and, in general, the prospects for external funding of Brazilian economy remain favorable.",
        "Meanwhile, the trajectory of prices indices shows the increase of inflationary pressures in some relevant economies, whereas concerns regarding the prospects of deflation in other economies tend to deplete.",
        "The Copom evaluates that domestic economy activity prospects are favorable in this and in the upcoming quarters.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, despite at a moderate pace, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom considers, additionally, that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor market, mirrored in the historical low unemployment rates and substantial growth of real wages, particularly in the public sector.",
        "In fact, in the last quarter of 2010, inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by the dynamics of food prices, which in part reflected domestic and external supply shocks.",
        "These developments tend to be transmitted to the prospective scenario, among other mechanisms, through inertia, as pointed by the figures considered by the Committee in its inflation forecasts, as well as market analysts projections.",
        "The Committee considers relevant the risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "It is also noteworthy the narrow margin in production factors idleness, especially in labor force.",
        "Under such circumstances, a relevant risk is posed by the possibility of concession of nominal wages increase incompatible with productivity growth.",
        "The prospective scenario considers the seasonal aspect of inflation in the first quarter, as well as the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments foreseen to be implemented in this period, although, for the year as a whole, the behavior of these items tend to be relatively benign.",
        "The benchmark scenario also considers the potential negative impact stemming from extremely adverse weather conditions observed in the beginning of this year in some regions of the country, although it attributes significant probability to the hypotheses that, at least in part, this process may be reverted during the year.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit expansion, for which the macroprudential actions recently adopted contribute.",
        "The Committee considers that, in part, such regulatory changes should materialize as an element of aggregate demand constraint through the credit channel, as well as by the reduction of incentives to the adoption of strategies such as the simple broadening of contract tenures, among others.",
        "The available information confirm this opinion, by evidencing relevant impacts both in prices and in volume of goods traded in the credit market.",
        "Additionally, it is plausible to affirm that the current regulatory framework, compared to the previous one, tends to heighten the impacts of conventional monetary policy actions.",
        "In short, the Copom recognizes an economic environment in which an above-than-usual uncertainty level prevails, and identifies increasing risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint target.",
        "From another point-of-view, they reveal the still ambiguous influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation behavior.",
        "Regarding the domestic outlook, the recently announced macroprudential actions, a fast and powerful tool to contain local demand pressures, will still have their effects incorporated to price dynamics.",
        "Although uncertainties that surround the global outlook and, at a minor magnitude, the domestic one, do not allow the clear identification the degree of permanence of recent pressures, the Committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario evolved unfavorably.",
        "Domestic demand is robust, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "Moreover, although tending to cool down, fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in the last quarters, and should still contribute for the activity expansion and, hence, for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low levels.",
        "The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial crisis, by the not yet very favorable prospects for global economy and, mainly, by recent macroprudential actions.",
        "These elements and the developments in the fiscal outlook are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The Nuci in the capital goods, construction material and intermediate goods industries reduced 0.4 p.p., 0.4 p.p.",
        "and 0.3 p.p., respectively, in the period.",
        "The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations increased from 456 days in October to 469 days in November, representing an increase of thirteen and twelve days for tenures related to individuals and corporate segments, which reached 551 days and 395 days, respectively.",
        "In the US, the current prospects consider better domestic demand development, mainly consumption, in an environment of reduction of uncertainties associated to employment and income.",
        "The recent extension of tax cuts fiscal law in the US, which included reduction in taxes levied on payroll, contributes for this favorable prospect.",
        "Commodities international prices registered strong increase in the last months of 2010, in some cases exceeding the record highs reached in Heightened by investors actions in financial markets, the occurrence of adverse weather conditions and consumption strengthening worldwide were the main drivers of that behavior.",
        "In special, the performance of agricultural commodities prices trend was highly impacted by the deterioration of supply conditions in several regions, reflecting the climate impact caused by La Nia phenomena.",
        "December inflation indices captured the trajectory of commodities prices increase.",
        "This trend reflects, in emerging markets, increases in the prices of agricultural commodities, domestic demand strengthening and product gap reduction in their economies, while in the US and in the Euro Area, December hikes are mainly associated to increases in energy prices.",
        "In this context, the central banks in the US and Euro Area maintained the accommodative stance of their policies, choosing by keeping their respective basic interest rates unchanged, being followed by the UK and Japan central banks.",
        "This movement was influenced by several factors, among which the release of high current inflation indices, including different core measures; the upward trajectory of commodities prices in the international market; and uncertainties related to the implementation of the fiscal adjustment announced by the government.",
        "Moreover, for the short term tenures, the market agents prospects regarding the start of a new cycle of basic interest rate increase also contributed for the upward movement in the rates.",
        "One-, twoand three-year interest rates increased 0.43 p.p., 0.41 p.p.",
        "and 0.45 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB also borrowed money through 31 overnight repo operations and conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day tenure liquidity management operations.",
        "The main driver of liquidity expansion in the period was the net redemption of securities by the National Treasury.",
        "For large companies, combined analysis of the indicators of supply, demand and approval scenario suggests more restrictive scenario.",
        "In relation to credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, the indicators reveal a scenario moderately more restrictive in terms of supply, and moderately stronger in terms of demand.",
        "Regarding credit to consumption, in contrast to that observed in the quarter that began in July, participants expect the percentage of approval of new lines for the fourth quarter to be moderately higher than in the previous quarter, consistent with the seasonal pattern.",
        "Services and trade were the sectors that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in the month.",
        "In short, evidences indicate that although the labor market remains robust, there are signs of moderation at the margin.",
        "In the coming months, the retail trajectory will continue to be positively influenced by governmental transfers, by the growth pace of real payroll, by the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit expansion.",
        "Thus, capacity utilization stood 1.6 p.p.",
        "The rates of capacity utilization have been retreating, reflecting, in part, the reduction in 3 the pace of production growth and the maturity of investments.",
        "Global economy faces a period of uncertainty above the usual, with deterioration in activity prospects.",
        "Risks to global financial stability are high, among other factors, due to the exposure of international banks to sovereign debts of countries with fiscal imbalances, especially in the Euro Zone.",
        "From another perspective, high persistent unemployment rates, coupled with the need for fiscal adjustments, as well as limited scope for monetary policy actions and political uncertainty, have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in advanced countries or even of their potential growth, indicating wider and more volatile economic cycle.",
        "In specific cases, the probability of recession increased.",
        "There has also been continued reduction in growth projections for important emerging economies.",
        "Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances and, in specific cases, with new non-conventional initiatives in the field of monetary policy.",
        "In emerging economies, in general, the bias of monetary policy is expansionary.",
        "It bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of prices, which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment projects.",
        "Regarding the other commodities, it is noteworthy the continuity of the decline in the international prices of the ones related to agriculture and metals.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available information.",
        "The spread for the third quarter of 2013 is 54 bps.",
        "For 2012, the inflation projections decreased in both the benchmark and the market scenarios, and stand around the midpoint of the target in both scenarios.",
        "For 2013 Q3, projected inflation also decreased and stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and above, in the market scenario.",
        "In the main scenario considered by the Copom, projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in This scenario was developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that identify in a broader manner the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the Brazilian economy among others, the trade, imports prices and the external volatility channels.",
        "As a working hypothesis, it considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the Brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international crisis.",
        "Moreover, it assumes that the current deterioration of the international scenario is more persistent than the one verified in , but less acute, without observance of extreme events.",
        "According to this mains scenario, domestic economic activity moderates and commodities prices in international markets and the exchange rate show some stability, among other effects.",
        "Even with a moderate adjustment in the basic interest rate level, the inflation rate in the relevant horizon stands around the target in 2012, at a level below the one that would be observed if the above mentioned effect of the international crisis were not considered.",
        "In this respect, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to BCB projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly price setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",

        "Evidences under this respect can be observed, among other factors, through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven years, at the same time that real interest rates have reduced.",
        "Progress in the financial markets structure, the reduction of both FX and inflationary risk premia, among other factors, seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral rate.",
        "From another point-of-view, some of these developments, combined to others, such as the extension of contract tenures, also suggest that the power of monetary policy in Brazil has been increasing in the last years, despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of non-observable variables.",
        "The Committee also considers that there are evidences that the monetary policy traction increased in the recent past and, compared to what was observed some years ago, inflationary pressures are currently contained with more efficiency by monetary policy actions.",
        "The Committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain high.",
        "It also notes that, in these economies, there seems to be limited scope for using monetary policy, and a scenario of fiscal restraint also prevails.",
        "In addition, for the main emerging economies, despite the resilience of domestic demand, the pace of activity has moderated, in part, a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external demand, through the trade channel.",
        "Therefore, the Committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant horizon.",
        "For the Copom, there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the Brazilian economy can be materialized through many channels, among others, the reduction of total trade flows, the moderation in investment inflows, tighter credit conditions and the worsening 6 in consumer and businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment add up to the those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity observed this semester, which is already mirrored, for instance, in the retreat of growth projections for the Brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming year.",
        "In other words, the ongoing moderation process of the economy - a result of the policy actions implemented since the end of last year - tends to be boosted by the weakness of the global economy.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is observed, prospects for economic activity are still favorable.",
        "This assessment is supported by signs that, despite showing some cooling, point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers confidence, notwithstanding the accommodation at the margin, stands at historically high levels.",
        "The Copom considers, additionally, that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public transfers, as well as by the labor market vigor, mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages growth, despite some accommodation at the margin.",
        "The Copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months peaked in the last quarter, and it begins to retreat in the current quarter, therefore, moving towards the targets path.",
        "The Committee evaluates that, by itself, this reversion of trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic agents, especially those of the price setters, about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming quarters.",
        "Additionally, the Committee believes that this improved perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity pace, both domestic and external, in this and in the upcoming semesters.",
        "The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "It bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation projections, in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth rates, will strengthen the trend of the public debt-to-GDP ratio reduction.",
        "It bears highlighting that, since the beginning of this year, important decisions have been taken and implemented, which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is underway.",
        "The Copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderation in credit market expansion.",
        "Still about the credit market, the Committee considers opportune the adoption of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "The Copom evaluates that, at the start of the year, inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply shocks, as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments.",
        "In decreasing intensity, these developments should also indirectly impact the dynamics of consumer prices, through inertia, among other mechanisms.",
        "The Copom evaluates as relevant, despite decreasing, the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth rates.",
        "Moreover, it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market.",
        "Despite signs of moderation in this market, it considers that, under such circumstances, an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation dynamics.",
        "On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the longterm trend, that is, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain price pressures.",
        "The Committee also observes that, at the end of last year and at the start of this year, the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory were key to the prospective scenario.",
        "However, since April these prices have retreated in international markets.",
        "The Copom notes that, according to the main scenario, the inflation rate stands around the target in 2012 and identifies decreasing risks to the confirmation of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint target.",
        "Domestic demand is still robust, especially household consumption, largely due to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit expansion.",
        "This scenario tends to prevail in the upcoming quarters, when the domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of the monetary policy actions recently implemented which, in short, are lagged and cumulative.",
        "On the other hand, recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector expenditures.",
        "Another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial deterioration in the international scenario.",
        "These elements and the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path.",
        "The monthly result for IPCA reflected the deceleration of market and regulated prices.",
        "The main contributions to the change of industrial prices came from metallic minerals and petroleum and alcohol byproducts, each one contributing 0.11 p.p..\nFour out of the five IPCA core inflation measures calculated by the BCB showed relative stability in October, compared to the previous month.",
        "Three measures decelerated in the twelve months through October, compared to the twelve months through September.",
        "The monthly result was mainly driven by the respective contributions of 0.53 p.p.",
        "Nine out of the 26 manufacturing industry activities surveyed increased in the month.",

        "The structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal indicator.",
        "It also bears emphasizing that, in a given period, the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural result in comparison to the observed in the previous period.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision The Copom emphasizes that the international evidence, which is ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress investments.",
        "These distortions are manifested, for example, in the shortening of planning horizons of households, companies and governments, as well as in the deterioration of businessmen confidence.",
        "The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over the households confidence and consumption.",
        "As a consequence, high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic growth, as well as of jobs and income generation.",
        "In view of this, the Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longer-term macroeconomic environment.",
        "In this sense, the Copom reassures that, under the inflation targeting regime, it guides its decisions according to the BCBs projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices dynamics.",
        "The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, particularly prices setters.",
        "Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect, in a more long-lasting manner, the dynamics of headline inflation in the future.",
        "Although the Copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices trajectory, it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant, to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer horizons.",
        "The Committee considers that the external environment remains especially complex.",
        "However, despite the occurrence of episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging economies, the Committee also identifies low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial markets.",

        "Recent prospects indicate modest activity recovery in the advanced economies, while important emerging economies experience a transition period.",
        "In this context, of reduction in the activity pace, it bears highlighting the ongoing concern regarding the Chinese economy and its developments over other economies, coupled with the uncertainties regarding the US economy outlook.",
        "Still regarding international financial markets, the Copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities prices, despite some recent increases.",
        "Regarding oil, the Committee highlights that, regardless of the behavior of the domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy through productive chains, such as the petrochemical.",
        "In addition, it should be noted the increased uncertainty generated by low oil prices and their implications for oil companies and producing countries, as well as for financial markets in general, with risks to global financial stability.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that domestic absorption and GDP growth rates continue to adjust, indicating low domestic activity expansion pace this year.",
        "This process has been especially intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of non-economic events.",
        "In particular, investment has retreated, mainly influenced by the occurrence of these events, and private consumption also decreases, in line with credit, employment and income data.",
        "However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which has been more intense and longer than anticipated, as companies and households confidence strengthen, the activity pace tends to intensify.",
        "Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the aggregate supply and demand composition.",
        "Consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain momentum.",
        "These changes, coupled with other ones currently underway, anticipate an aggregate demand growth composition in the medium term more favorable to potential growth.",
        "Regarding the external component of aggregate demand, the depreciation of the BRL contributes to make this component more favorable to the Brazilian economic growth.",
        "Regarding the supply side, the Committee evaluates that, in longer horizons, more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry, agriculture and livestock emerge.",
        "The services sector, on its turn, tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent years.",
        "For the Committee, it is plausible to claim that these developments will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity gains.",
        "However, the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them depends, fundamentally, on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance sustainability, in addition to the reduction of uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international environment.",
        "It is worth mentioning the importance of ensuring a primary results trajectory that enables stabilization and further reduction of public debt to GDP ratio, which is a crucial measure to reinforce the positive perception regarding the economic environment, to improve the confidence of agents and to contribute to the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "The Copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the recently assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "Relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic cycle, the Committee considers that the balance of the public sector stands in expansionary zone.",
        "The Committee hightlights that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation, as well as in its composition, impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections.",
        "Concerning inflation control, the Committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy framework, in order to allow the monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to prices.",
        "The Copom highlights that the main scenario considers credit moderation, which had already been observed and tends to persist.",
        "Regarding this issue, it is important to highlight the fact that, after years of strong 5 expansion, consumer credit has moderated, so that, over the last quarters, there were, on the one hand, exposure reduction by banks and, on the other hand, deleveraging of the households.",
        "In the aggregate, therefore, it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been mitigated.",
        "In another dimension, as illustrated by actions that have been implemented, the Committee considers as opportune to continue to reinforce the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "In the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market is high, with data confirming the acceleration of the expected distension in this market.",
        "However, a significant risk still prevails related, particularly, to the possibility of concession of high nominal wages increases, with negative impacts over inflation.",
        "In spite of the recent occurrence of real wage changes consistent with the estimates for the labor productivity gains, the Committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating cost inflationary pressures.",
        "The Copom considers that the still elevated twelve-month inflation level reflects the relative prices adjustment processes occurred in 2015, as well as the recovery process of the fiscal revenues observed at the federal and state levels, at the start of the year, in addition to the temporary supply shocks in the food segment, and which cause inflation to show resistence.",
        "Although the Committee recognizes that these processes have direct impact on inflation, it reaffirms its view that the monetary policy can, should and is containing the second-order effects stemming from them.",
        "The Committee recognizes the progress in disinflation policy, especially the containment of second-order effects stemming from relative price adjustments.",
        "However, it considers that the high level of inflation in twelve months and the distance between inflation expectations and the inflation targeting regime objectives do not allow monetary policy easing.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy.",
        "On the one hand, household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as employment, income and credit; on the other hand, the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural income, among other factors, tend to benefit investments.",
        "On its turn, net exports show better results, either by increasing exports, benefited by the depreciation of the BRL, or by the ongoing import substitution process.",
        "Moreover, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy remain.",
        "Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 GDP fell, and the process of recovery of expectations components of confidence indices was interrupted.",
        "After breaking a long sequence of negative prints in the second quarter, the measure of investment in the national accounts fell again in the third quarter.",
        "The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices and, mainly, in the unemployment rate.",
        "After the decline in economic activity indicators for August, the absence of a reversal in the following months makes it less likely that these movements reflect natural fluctuations in economic activity around stabilization periods.",
        "There is a higher probability, therefore, that the recovery of economic activity will be slower and more gradual than previously anticipated.",
        "The global outlook is particularly uncertain.",
        "The increase in asset price volatility indicates the possible end of the benign period for emerging economies.",
        "There is a high probability of resumption of the process of normalization of monetary conditions in the United States in the short term, as well as uncertainty over the future course of its economic policy.",
        "Returning to the domestic economy, recent inflation figures came in more favorably than expected, partly due to the reversal of food price increases, but also with signs of more widespread disinflation.",
        "The market scenario considers the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the Focus survey.",
        "Over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, the Copoms conditional forecasts fluctuated around the previous levels due to factors with opposing effects.",
        "The inflation rate of these components has been retreating in 12-month windows, but the pause persists, at the margin, according to seasonally adjusted monthly measures of underlying inflation.",
        "This could reflect greater inflation resilience, despite the high level of economic slack.",
        "On the other hand, the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity tend to produce disinflation that can be more intense than the one reflected in inflation expectations measured by the Focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the Copom.",
        "In fact, the more favorable inflation dynamics in the recent period show signs of more widespread disinflation.",
        "It is, therefore, reasonable to expect softer economic activity in the short run and the prospect of a further delayed and more gradual recovery to reinforce this process.",

        "The steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have been positive so far, which suggests greater timeliness and higher probability of approval.",
        "On the other hand, the process is lengthy and carries uncertainty.",
        "The reduction of uncertainty would enhance the effects of monetary policy, and reduce the costs of the ongoing disinflationary process.",
        "The possible end of the benign period for emerging economies might make disinflation more difficult.",
        "It is possible, however, that its effects be mitigated by favorable movements in commodity prices that are relevant to the countrys terms of trade, which would be a stabilizing factor.",
        "Furthermore, the end of the benign period may imply tighter external financial conditions, which would contribute a disinflationary component.",
        "Therefore, there is no direct relationship between the global outlook and the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "They all agreed that the economy continued to show signs of weakness past August.",
        "September releases and indicators available for October and November failed to show a reversal that should be expected in a scenario of natural fluctuations of economic activity around stabilization periods.",
        "This increases the likelihood that the resumption of economic activity may be further delayed, and be more gradual than previously anticipated.",
        "Regarding the global outlook, the Committee members pointed out the risks associated with the possible end of the relatively benign environment for emerging economies of late.",
        "They all agreed that the process of normalization of monetary policy in the United States should be resumed in the near term, and that the course of its economic policy became a source of uncertainty.",
        "The Copom evaluated that part of this uncertainty should dissipate in the coming months.",
        "They also agreed that by the end of the year the Committee should have a more accurate assessment of the possible impacts of the resumption of the process of monetary policy normalization in the United States.",
        "The members of the Committee argued that, in face of expectations that global economic activity will strengthen, movements in the terms of trade may the margin, of the aforementioned IPCA have mitigating effects.",

        "The discussion turned then to the pace of easing.",
        "Other Copom members argued that the evolution of some inflation components that are more sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary policy continue to indicate a pause, at the margin.",
        "These same members reasoned, nevertheless, that if economic activity fails to show clearer signs of recovering, it is reasonable to expect an intensification of the pace of monetary easing, since in this case inflation forecasts should decrease.",
        "The members of the Committee discussed the path for regulated prices and its effects on the prospective scenario for inflation.",
        "In this context, the members of the Committee emphasized, once again, that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would enable the Copom to focus on preventing second-round effects of these relative price adjustments.",

        "The members of the Committee emphasized that these efforts are crucial for the stabilization and the development of the Brazilian economy.",
        "The Committee should monitor these efforts closely, since they have important implications for the disinflation process.",
        "The Committee understands that the pace of monetary easing will be calibrated, taking into account its inflation projections and its determinant factors, in order to pursue a path that allows the inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 to be met.",
        "The Committee judges that currently there is no incompatibility between these two objectives.",
        "Inflation forecasts for both years have improved, especially in the market scenario.",
        "This suggests that there may be more room for monetary easing than previously perceived.",
        "The Committee discussed the factors determining the pace and magnitude of monetary easing.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that the palpable risk that a timely recovery of economic activity fails to materialize should allow the intensification of the pace of monetary easing.",
        "The magnitude of monetary easing and the speeding up of its pace will depend on inflation forecasts and expectations, and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk factors.",
        "In that respect, the Copom emphasizes that the pace of disinflation in its forecasts might intensify if the economic recovery is delayed further, and occurs more gradually than anticipated.",
        "This intensification of the disinflation process relies on an adequate global environment.",

        "However, the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them depends, fundamentally, on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance sustainability, in addition to the reduction of uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international environment.",
        "It is worth mentioning the importance of persevering in promoting structural reforms to ensure the fiscal consolidation in the longer terms.",
        "The Copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables.",
        "Relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic cycle, the Committee considers that, during the relevant horizon for the monetary policy, the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral zone, and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint area, even if more slowly and with lower intensity than previously antecipated.",
        "However, the Committee observes that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation, as well as in its composition, impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding the macroeconomic environment, as well as have negatively impacted the inflation expectations.",
        "Concerning inflation control, the Committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy framework, in order to allow the monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to prices.",
        "The Copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion, which had already been observed and tends to persist.",
        "Regarding this issue, it is important to highlight the fact that, after years of strong expansion, consumer credit has moderated, so that, over the last quarters, there were, on the one hand, exposure reduction by banks, and, on the other hand, deleveraging of the households.",
        "In the aggregate, therefore, it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been mitigated.",
        "In another dimension, as illustrated by actions that were implemented, the Committee considers as opportune to continue to reinforce the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit operations.",
        "In the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market is high, with data confirming the acceleration in the process of distension in this market.",
        "However, there is still the prevalence of significant risk related, particularly, to the possibility of concession of high nominal wages increases, with negative impacts over inflation.",
        "In spite of the occurrence of real wage changes 5 more consistent with the estimates for the labor productivity gains, the Committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost pressures.",
        "The Copom considers that the still elevated inflation level mirrors the relative prices adjustment processes occurred in 2015, as well as the recovery process of the fiscal results observed in the federal and state levels, at the start of the year, and that cause inflation to show resistence.",
        "Although the Committee recognizes that these processes have direct impact on inflation, it reaffirms its view that the monetary policy can, should and is containing the second-order effects stemming from them.",
        "Given the above, assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation prospects, the Copom considers that uncertainties associated to the balance of risks remain, mainly regarding the recovery process of the fiscal results and its composition, the current inflation behavior and the inflation expectations.",
        "Additionally, the uncertainties regarding the external scenario remain, with highlights to the concern about the performance of the Chinese economy and its developments and about the evolution of oil prices.",
        "Part of its members argued that it would be appropriate to adjust, immediately, the monetary conditions, in order to reduce the risks of noncompliance of the inflation targeting regime objectives, reinforce the process of anchoring inflation expectations and contribute to contain the increase in inflation projections.",
        "However, most of the Copom members considered that the domestic and, mainly, the external uncertainties, justify to keep on monitoring the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario, to then define the next steps in its monetary policy strategy.",
        "The Copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy.",
        "On the one hand, household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as employment, income and credit; on the other hand, the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural income, among other factors, tend to benefit investments.",
        "On its turn, net exports show better results, either by increasing exports, benefited by the depreciation of the BRL, or by the ongoing import substitution process.",
        "Moreover, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy remain.",
        "The members of the Copom analyzed the recent performance and prospects for the Brazilian and the international economies, under the monetary policy framework, whose objective is to comply with the inflation targets established by the National Monetary Council.",
        "In particular, there are signs of interruption in the fall of investment and industrial production.",
        "However, the economy continues to operate with a high level of idle capacity, reflected in industrial capacity utilization indexes and, mainly, in the unemployment rate.",
        "Signs of additional stimulus by monetary authorities of some developed economies contributed to stabilize financial markets and to create a relatively benign environment for emerging economies in the short term.",
        "However, the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain fragile, with uncertainty regarding growth and deflationary risks in major developed economies.",
        "The possible economic consequences of _Brexit contributed to an increase_ in medium- and long-term uncertainty and produced downward revisions in growth forecasts for the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone.",
        "Nevertheless, the paths for the interest rate under appropriate policy reported by its members remain above the path inferred from financial instruments, which might lead to corrections in the future.",
        "Returning to the domestic economy, price indexes showed inflation exceeding expectations in the short term, due to food price increases and, perhaps, to more persistent inflation.",
        "It is worth noting that the same does not occur under the assumptions of the market scenario, which imposes the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the Focus survey.",
        "In short, the Committees baseline scenario contemplates disinflation in the Brazilian economy in the upcoming years.",
        "For 2017, disinflation towards the target occurs under the assumptions of the reference scenario.",
        "However, in the market scenario, disinflation evolves at a slower pace than the one pursued by the Committee.",
        "The Copom uses the term \"conditional forecast\" to emphasize that the forecasts in the reference and market scenarios depend on conditioning assumptions for the future paths of the policy rate and the exchange rate, among other variables.",
        "It is monetary authorities of some developed worth noting that the same does not occur under produced downward revisions in growth forecasts under the reference and market scenarios point to for the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone.",
        "However, in the market monetary policy.",

        "There are short-term risks to inflation in Brazil.",
        "The recent increase in food prices can show persistence, given the transmission process from wholesale prices into retail prices.",
        "However, favorable seasonality may contribute to a fast reversion of these prices.",
        "Additionally, on the one hand, prolonged periods of high inflation and above-target expectations, such as in the recent Brazilian experience, tend to reinforce inertial mechanisms and make the disinflation process slower and costlier.",
        "In this context, greater inflationary persistence requires greater monetary policy persistence.",
        "On the other hand, the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity can, in principle, produce faster disinflation - for example, in the services sector - than the one reflected in the inflation expectations measured by the Focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the Copom.",
        "The implementation of the necessary adjustments in the economy, including those of fiscal nature, presents itself as both a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing disinflationary process.",
        "The risks would materialize if there were a perception that adjustments would be abandoned or postponed significantly.",
        "In this scenario, the disinflationary process would tend to be slower, increasing the costs of bringing inflation to target.",
        "On the other hand, the necessary adjustments in the economy can be approved and implemented more quickly, enabling confidence gains and falling inflation expectations.",
        "In this case, the reduction of uncertainty would boost the effects of the ongoing monetary adjustment process.",
        "There are risks that are inherent to the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "The latter impacts the economy with long, variable and uncertain lags.",
        "It is thus expected that, even under appropriate policy, realized inflation will fluctuate around target.",
        "This is due to the substantial uncertainty associated with inflation projections in the relevant horizons, which arises naturally from the incidence of favorable and unfavorable shocks to the economy over time.",
        "The Committee should seek to conduct monetary policy so that inflation projections, including in the market scenario, point to the inflation target in the relevant horizon.",
        "The Committee members agreed that there was a noticeable improvement in the macroeconomic scenario and that recent indicators show prospects for the stabilization of economic activity in the near term.",
        "This perspective is corroborated by the improvement in some forward-looking indicators of economic activity.",
        "Regarding inflation, the Committee members also agreed that progress has been made.",
        "However, the ongoing disinflation process has been evolving at a speed that is below the one pursued by the Committee.",
        "There are prospects of progress in this dimension, supported by the fall in measures of inflation expectations for 2017 and Regarding the international context, some members of the Committee were relatively optimistic with respect to the environment for emerging economies assets in the short term.",
        "Financial markets have reacted positively to the possibility of additional stimuli signaled by some central monetary authorities after Brexit.",
        "This suggests that monetary policies retain the capacity to provide stimulus, despite the levels of interest rates in major economies and the size of the balance sheets of major central banks.",
        "The possibility of additional stimuli has, in fact, created a benign period for such assets.",
        "However, all members of the Committee highlighted the presence of medium- and long-term risks in the external environment, associated with the fragility of the global economic recovery.",
        "In some developed economies, non-economic factors may pose tail risks.",

        "Finally, some members argued that the eventual end of the benign period for emerging economies can pose a risk in itself.",
        "All members of the Monetary Policy Committee emphasized that the continuation of efforts for approval and implementation of adjustments in the economy, especially with regard to fiscal reforms, is essential to facilitate and reduce the cost of the disinflation process.",
        "There was no consensus on the speed of these adjustments, which suggests that they may constitute both a risk and an opportunity.",
        "All members agreed that the implications of the adjustment process in the economy for inflation dynamics depend not only on the impact of shortterm measures on aggregate demand, but also on the perception of improved dynamics of public finances in the medium and long term.",

        "between inflation expectations calculated by the Focus survey and the projections produced by the Monetary Policy Committee for the current year.",

        "Regarding wholesale prices, the deceleration in industrial price increases was accompanied by a decline in agricultural prices.",
        "In this group, despite price increases for vegetables, fruits, beans, corn and coffee, the declines in wheat and animal products prices prevailed.",
        "In the IPA-DI measured according to the production stage, final and intermediate goods price increases slowed in January, while prices of raw materials declined.",
        "IPCA core inflation decelerated slightly in January, but remained at high levels.",
        "The persistence of high core inflation and the behavior of the diffusion index indicate the dissemination of price increases across the economy.",
        "The IPCA tends to come under pressure in February, due to the seasonal impact of education costs and the projected readjustments for regulated prices.",
        "Perishable food prices should continue on the upward trend begun in January, due to unfavorable weather conditions during the harvest.",
        "In wholesale prices, besides the influence of perishable food prices, prices of iron, steel and byproducts should continue to exert pressure.",
        "On the other hand, the declines in the prices of animal products tend to continue.",
        "Moreover, the exchange rate appreciation should favorably influence domestic prices, mainly commodities such as soy, corn and wheat.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The category of food, beverage, and housing continued to post high monthly inflation rates.",
        "Relative to December, regulated price inflation decelerated, while market prices continued to increase at a pace similar to previous months.",
        "The IPCA deceleration in January was also due to a break in the trend of high monthly increases in tradable goods prices, in contrast to non-tradable goods, which continued to increase for the fourth consecutive month.",
        "Despite the deceleration in the monthly IPCA inflation, the dissemination of price increases in recent months across the consumer basket continues to expand.",
        "According to production stage criteria, the IPA result for January was particularly influenced by the deceleration in the prices of gross raw materials, agricultural goods, final goods, food and fuel.",
        "The low changes in the IPA in recent months are, in part, due to the recent exchange rate appreciation and may affect positively the future evolution of consumer prices.",
        "Naturally, the intensity of this pass-through will depend on prospective demand conditions and price setters expectations regarding the future inflation path, as highlighted in previous Copom Minutes.",

        "This performance confirms the recent shift in the composition of economic activity, as growth has increasingly been sustained by the more income- and employment-sensitive sectors.",

        "The result for December and the subsequent series revisions show that industrial output increased more than expected in recent months.",
        "For January, leading and coincident indicators signal an accommodation in industrial activity.",
        "However, inventory indicators show that they remain at desirable levels, compatible with economic growth.",
        "One should expect temporary accommodation in the pace of industrial output growth, but still consistent with a scenario in which there is a continuation of the expansion begun in the second half of As noted in previous Copom Minutes, it is normal that, after the initial strong impulse at the outset of the economic recovery, the growth process tends to converge to rates more compatible with the pace of output capacity expansion.",

        "In the context of a highly volatile oil price scenario, international oil prices stand below domestic oil prices.",
        "However, given the oil price volatility observed in recent months, these developments do not mean that there will be sufficient room to reduce domestic oil prices during the year.",
        "As mentioned in prior Copom Minutes, inflation expectations for 2005 remain high, despite favorable events that could dampen inflationary pressures, such as the signs of deceleration in economic growth, exchange rate appreciation, the decline in important commodity prices, and the signaling of a more restrictive monetary stance in the last months.",
        "The exchange rate appreciation and the increase in the yield curve balanced the effects of higherthan-expected January inflation and anticipated increases in regulated prices during the year.",
        "For 2006, the forecasts also showed improvement at the margin, with the benchmark scenario forecast below the target established by the National Monetary Council for the year, and the market scenario forecast above the target.",
        "Since the beginning of the monetary policy adjustment process, inflation expectations and forecasts have improved, although the current headline and core inflation are still incompatible with the medium-term targets.",
        "The more restrictive monetary policy stance adopted since September 2004 will increase the likelihood that the deceleration of wholesale price inflation positively influences consumer price inflation.",
        "Moreover, there is the possibility that the positive seasonal effects of food prices will be registered earlier this year than in prior years.",
        "Combined, these factors may contribute to attainment of inflation rates in the first half of the year that bolster confidence in the convergence of 2005 inflation to the target path.",
        "This increase in the likelihood of inflation convergence to the target path is tied to the response of economic activity and inflation to the monetary policy stance.",
        "In the January Minutes, the Copom mentioned specific factors, among the uncertainties regarding macroeconomic projections, which could harm the convergence process.",
        "Of particular concern was the intensity of self-propagating forces in the economic cycle, tied mainly to income and employment dynamics, and the possibility of greater inflation persistence, given aggregate demand conditions.",
        "In the evaluation of the committee members, data released thus far, including signs of a break in the inflation acceleration registered in the fourth quarter, reduce the likelihood of realization of the risks mentioned in January.",
        "These risk factors should not be interpreted as evidence of the loss of monetary policy effectiveness as a result of recent credit and fiscal developments.",
        "Independent of the specific importance of these developments to current performance, it is important to highlight that every expansionary impulse requires an adequate monetary policy response, but does not necessarily represent the loss of effectiveness of conventional monetary instruments.",
        "Credit growth as a result of the introduction of new personal loan contracts is an important structural advance that, in addition to making a permanent contribution toward improving the efficiency of financial intermediation, should also increase monetary policy effectiveness in the medium run.",
        "In the opinion of the Copom members, there is no evidence to suggest that monetary policy will be unable to assure convergence to the inflation target path during the period required to consolidate this structural change.",
        "Furthermore, the monetary stance implemented in recent months takes into consideration the fiscal policy impact on aggregate demand and, ultimately, on inflation.",
        "It is undeniable that reductions in fiscal expenditures reinforce monetary policys efforts to control inflation, and that improvements in the public accounts contribute to further reductions in real interest rates in the medium run.",
        "However, again, it does not mean that the current fiscal policy stance makes conventional monetary policy instruments inefficient in the control of inflation.",
        "With a reduction in the risks of convergence of inflation to the target path, the Copom understood that the process of interest rate adjustment should be maintained at the originally projected pace.",
        "The committee members still agree that this adjustment, followed by a sufficiently long period of stable interest rates, will be sufficient to align the future path of inflation with the monetary policy objective.",
        "Although the current monetary policy decision brings the Selic interest rate close to a level that, according to the Copoms opinion, will promote inflation convergence to the target path, the Copom recognizes that it is still not possible to assume, with this decision, the conclusion of the adjustment process initiated in September.",
        "The extent of additional tightening will depend on confirmation in the data of the favorable scenario that is beginning to materialize, and on economic agents perception that interest rates will remain constant for a sufficiently long period of time at the conclusion of the process.",
        "Clearly, in the case of a reversal in the evolution of the projected inflation outlook or of an exacerbation of the other risk factors followed closely by the Copom, the monetary authority will be prepared to adjust the pace and magnitude of the interest rate adjustment process to the circumstances.",

        "Inflation has remained under control in Europe, despite the recent surge.",

        "As noted in prior Copom Minutes, it is normal that, after the initial strong impulse, the growth process converges to rates consistent with the pace of output capacity expansion.",

        "Some factors, however, represent risks to the process of inflation convergence to the target trajectory during the coming months.",
        "First, it is possible that self-propagating forces stimulate aggregate demand more than expected in the forecast exercises.",
        "The uncertainty surrounding the intensity of these forces in the Brazilian economy is similar to those related to the immediate monetary policy transmission, especially because the country did not experience sustained growth in the last years.",
        "Second, the stickiness of inflation, given current aggregate demand conditions, could also prove more intense than that estimated with data available for the Brazilian economy.",
        "The recent acceleration of core inflation and the upward revision of industrial output could evidence risks to the monetary management, or, alternatively, could only reflect the usual transmission lags between monetary policy, activity and inflation.",
        "Considering the likelihood that recent consumer price dynamics could actually represent a deterioration of the risks to meet the inflation target trajectory, the Copom examined the possibility of accelerating the pace of interest rate adjustment.",
        "However, there was consensus among the Committee members that available data would not justify such acceleration.",
        "The members of the Copom confirm their conviction that additional phases of the current process of monetary adjustment, followed by a sufficiently long period of stable interest rates, will be sufficient to align the future path of inflation with the monetary policy objective.",
        "Clearly, if the inflationary process proves resistant to the monetary stance adopted since September, or if other risk factors deteriorate, the monetary authority will be prepared to adjust the pace and magnitude of the interest rate adjustment process to the circumstances.",

        "The marginal increase in inflation expectations for the year is, however, related mainly to the higher than expected adjustment of some regulated prices, as was the case for urban bus fares, and to the less favorable international environment.",
        "Nonetheless, inflation expectations for the next twelve months and for 2006 remain stable, suggesting that the more restrictive monetary stance has prevented short-term inflationary pressures from contaminating longer-term inflation expectations.",

        "The exchange rate passthrough and the decompression of the profit margins seem to be the responsible for the high increases in the consumer price indices and yet the degree of influence of these factors in the next few months is uncertain, mainly in a context of economic recovery.",

        "In summary, a sum of factors contributes to a scenario of interest rate reduction in the coming years.",
        "The simulation exercises with the various specifications of the structural model points to inflation near the medium range target in However, the uncertainties regarding the recovery of the international economy, the improvement in the inflation indices due to a lower passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation, and the evolution of the Argentine crisis recommend that we wait for a confirmation of the more favorable scenario that starts to materialize."

        "Investment indicators improved slightly in January, after the downward trend observed in the second half of 2002 due to the uncertainties that marked the period.",
        "This behavior in the mineral extraction sector was a consequence of the normalization of activities in Brazils oil and gas fields, after prescheduled maintenance interruptions in the last two months of Regarding the evolution of the manufacturing sector, the January result confirms the signs of a slowdown in industrial activity, with the exception of the sectors closely linked to external trade.",

        "Summing up, economic activity lost momentum at the end of 2002 and in the beginning of this year, even though exports have continued to grow.",
        "There are signs that domestic demand has weakened due to the drop in real income as a consequence of higher inflation, a trend only partly attenuated by extraordinary disbursements from the FGTS.",
        "Additionally, consumer expectations have shown a reversal of the optimism seen during the governmental transition.",

        "The Copom also decided to withdraw the upward bias, which allowed the Governor to increase the Selic rate anytime between regular Copom meetings.",
        "Although there are doubts about the speed of the decline in inflation and questions regarding the extent to which the increase in inflation inertia is temporary or permanent, they will not be clarified between the monthly meetings, but over the longer term.",
        "The major segments responsible for the negative results were hypermarkets, supermarkets, food products, beverage and tobacco.",
        "These declines reflect decreases in workers real incomes due to higher prices of food and cleaning and personal hygiene products.",
        "Investment expanded again in February, mainly due to increased production and imports of capital goods.",

        "The recovery of the global economy continues to depend on a recovery of growth in the U.S.",
        "So far this year, the degree of this recovery has been unclear, as the most recent indicators were influenced by the uncertainties related to the war in Iraq.",
        "With the end of the war, consumer and business expectations may improve in the short-run, allowing some recovery in retail sales, reduction in inventories and resumption of industrial production, which may help the labor market.",
        "The stabilization in oil prices may revert inflationary pressures recently observed in the OECD economies, although it is premature to infer a trend for petroleum prices, given the recent announcement of cuts in output from OPEC members, and uncertainties about the rhythm of exports from Iraq.",
        "The increase in the value of imports was mainly due to the rise in oil prices.",
        "The significant demand for these securities allowed higher offers and the lengthening of tenures up to 15 months.",
        "Moreover, the reduction in the slope of the yield curve opened up room for placements at lower rates than those observed in the previous period.",
        "Longer term LFTs were also issued.",
        "In the same period, the BCB intervened in the money market with 1-week and 1-month repo operations, and conducted daily liquidity management operations with maturities of 2 working days.",
        "Regarding the evolution of wholesale prices, one should highlight the effects of the exchange rate appreciation and the normalization of the supply of perishable foods.",
        "In May, the positive effects of the exchange rate appreciation on inflation are likely to increase, particularly on wholesale prices, as signaled by recent previews of the IGP-M. With respect to consumer prices, tradable goods will also benefit from the exchange rate appreciation, and in conjunction with the fall of perishable food and fuel prices will contribute to the downward trend of inflation.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "Wholesale price inflation has been decreasing more than consumer price inflation.",
        "There is evidence that the dynamics of the two groups of prices have been different.",
        "At the wholesale level, the exchange rate appreciation and the normalization of the supply of perishable food have been the main factors underlying the decrease in inflation.",
        "However, the deceleration of consumer price inflation has not been as significant.",
        "Regulated prices increased by 0.34 p.p.",
        "Market price inflation declined, largely due to smaller price increases in services and items linked to the exchange rate.",
        "GDP may close the first quarter of 2003 roughly stable in comparison to the previous quarter.",
        "On the one hand, manufacturing output fell.",
        "On the other hand, the mineral extraction industry, the agricultural sector and the tradable goods sector registered positive performance.",
        "The resistance to a more rapid decline in consumer price inflation points to the existence of increased inflation persistence in the economy.",
        "The prices of important groups in the consumption basket have increased significantly, although at a decelerating rate, including beverages, canned products, cleaning and personal hygiene products and furniture and utensils.",
        "Consequently, core inflation still remains at a high level.",
        "This persistence is due to wage and price readjustments that have occurred since the beginning of the year and that have been based on the high inflation rate accumulated in the last twelve months, rather than assessments of future inflation.",
        "Also, businesses have made an effort to regain profit margins in a scenario of falling aggregated demand.",
        "This behavior resulted in a significant decrease in sales.",
        "The Copom believes that monetary policy should not ratify price and wage readjustments based on past inflation, due to the risk of perpetuating higher inflation.",
        "There are initial signs that monetary policy is curbing inflation.",
        "The Copom as well as market participants expect inflation to maintain a declining trend towards its target.",
        "Since inflation remains relatively high, it is still premature to conclude that inflation persistence is definitively decreasing and that the effect of the exchange rate appreciation on prices is significant.",
        "Thus, the Copom concludes that the decrease of inflation depends on the maintenance of its current effort.",

        "By sector, it is important to note the continuous expansion in the production of machinery and agricultural equipment, due to the increase in the income of the agricultural sector and the significant decrease in energy generating equipment.",
        "This decrease was a consequence of the high figures registered last year, when investment in this area was stimulated by the energy crisis.",
        "The data shows that the behavior of the industrial sector in March was consistent with developments that have been observed since mid-2002, with the best performance in the intermediate goods sector, relating to the expansion of exports, and the agricultural and oil extraction sectors.",

        "The results indicate that companies have been choosing short-term debt in order to recompose cash flows.",
        "In the month, fixed rate loans fell in some segments, mirroring the reduction in the slope of the yield curve as a result of the improvement in the sovereign-risk premium and the expectations of falling inflation.",
        "Regarding default rates on retail credit, there was a slight improvement in April.",
        "Business confidence in industrialized countries points to a contraction in economic activity.",
        "Regarding consumers, pessimism persists in Europe.",
        "However, there was a slight improvement in the US.",
        "In addition to the weak performance of industrialized economies, the spread of SARS is a new concern for the world economy, and growth in China and the countries of Southeast Asia may be significantly damaged.",
        "The volatility of oil prices remains high, and the downward trend in prices was partially reversed after the approval of the cut in production by OPEC countries, and the disturbance caused by a new wave of terrorist attacks.",
        "The inflation shows signs of falling in the main economies.",
        "In the US, consumer price indices in April registered the largest fall in nineteen months, fostering the perception that deflation risks are increasing.",
        "The weakening of the dollar may decrease this perception, and contribute to an improvement in the activity and a reduction of the US trade deficit.",
        "However, the appreciation of the euro increases the risks of deflation and recession in Europe.",
        "Central banks decided to keep interest rates unaltered in their last meetings.",
        "A decline in sovereign country risk, appreciation of the exchange rate, deceleration of inflation and market expectations of a larger reduction of inflation in the second half of the year contributed to this movement.",
        "Lower placement rates, as compared to the previous period, were due to the overall reduction in the dollar-linked interest rate curve.",
        "The significant demand for these securities and the movement in the domestic yield curve allowed the offer of increasing amounts, longer average tenures, and lower rates than in the previous period.",
        "In the same period, the Central Bank intervened weekly in the open market through 1-week, 2-week, and 1month repo operations, and conducted daily liquidity management operations with maturities of 2 working days.",
        "Inflation of both market and regulated prices in the IPCA slowed in May.",
        "Among tradable goods, there was a deceleration in the price increases of medicine, cleaning and personal hygiene products, furniture and utensils and electronics.",
        "In addition to electricity tariff hikes in 9 regions, urban bus and water and sewage tariffs contributed 0.08 p.p.",
        "and 0.03 p.p., respectively, to the increase in the May IPCA.",
        "Together gasoline and alcohol-based fuel contributed 0.20 p.p.",
        "to the change in the IPCA last month.",
        "It is important to highlight that even after the most recent reductions in petroleum products, domestic prices are still higher than international prices.",
        "Regarding the evolution of wholesale prices, one should highlight the effects of the exchange rate appreciation on both agricultural and industrial prices.",
        "However, the behavior of industrial prices at the wholesale level was not uniform, with a deceleration of price increases in some sectors, outright price declines in others - mainly chemicals, paper and cardboard and power lines - and higher pressures in sectors such as machinery, transportation, fabric, clothes and footwear, beverages and food products.",
        "Core measures of inflation with this index are also being influenced by the exchange rate shock last year.",
        "In June, wholesale prices will continue to reflect the exchange rate appreciation, registering additional declines as already signaled in the partial results for June inflation.",
        "Consumer price indices will come under some upward pressure from the prices of rice, milk and dairy products and clothing prices.",
        "However, this pressure will be lower than observed in May.",
        "Also, expected declines in the prices of fresh food, beef and fuel will facilitate a further deceleration of monthly inflation.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information.",
        "The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses.",
        "There are three basic factors explaining this recent behavior.",
        "First, the high inflation rates observed at the beginning of the year resulted from the delayed effects on prices of the strong exchange rate depreciation observed last year and the increase of inflation persistence, with more agents adjusting prices and wages based on past inflation.",
        "Second, the recent exchange rate appreciation has reduced pressures on companies costs and wholesale prices.",
        "Although there is still some resistance among the retail prices of tradable goods to pass-through from the recent exchange rate appreciation, consumer prices have tended to stabilize without additional readjustment pressures.",
        "Third, monetary policy has been successful in reducing inflation expectations and inflation pressures by controlling aggregate demand.",
        "Inflation persistence contributed to the continuation of high inflation in the initial months of the year.",
        "Higher inflation persistence was caused by an increase in the practice of backward-looking prices readjustment, and a corresponding decline in price readjustments based on future inflation.",
        "This behavior, aimed at improving profit margins in the initial months of the year, led to a significant decrease in sales in an environment of lower demand and a monetary policy committed to preventing price readjustments from perpetuating high inflation.",
        "Similar behavior has been observed when analyzing the trend of market prices.",
        "On the other hand, the exchange rate appreciation has contributed to a reduction of cost pressures on inflation.",
        "The maintenance of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the recent increase in international liquidity, contributed to the continuation of the exchange rate appreciation.",
        "The rollover rates for private securities and direct loans continue to increase.",
        "Economic activity continues to decelerate.",
        "The intensity and duration of this deceleration are similar to those observed in other recent periods of Brazilian history.",
        "However, due to the change in relative prices, especially regarding the prices of tradable goods compared to the prices of non-tradables, the deceleration of activity is not uniform.",
        "The sectors related to exports, including agribusiness, and the mineral extraction industry are expanding.",
        "On the other hand, the durable goods sector for internal consumers, which depends on domestic credit conditions, is the most depressed compared to the same month of last year.",
        "According to the factors explained above, monthly inflation remains on a downward trend.",
        "The decrease of 0.4 p.p.",
        "in IPCA inflation in May was strongly influenced by the 0.6 p.p.",
        "reduction in non-tradable goods prices, which resulted mainly from the normalization of the supply of perishable foods.",
        "Nevertheless, other groups also showed a reduction of inflation pressures.",
        "The decrease of the prices of gasoline and alcoholbased auto fuel was the main factor contributing to the reduction in regulated price inflation.",
        "The decline of consumer price inflation was followed by deflation in wholesale prices, both agricultural and industrial.",
        "Core inflation is also declining.",
        "Under this methodology, the readjustments of some items, which are concentrated in a few short periods of the year, are smoothed to avoid their exclusion from the core.",
        "When inflationary shocks occur, the core tends to be affected by past pressures and shows some resistance to falling.",
        "Another way to measure trimmed-mean core inflation, which avoids the influence of exchange rate shocks, is to substitute the current periods smoothed values with the corresponding values observed in the past 12 months.",
        "Both the Central Banks inflation forecasts and market inflation expectations have been converging to the inflation targets.",
        "Nonetheless, inflation in the second quarter of the year registered results compatible with those presented in the Open Letter sent by the Central Banks Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January Market inflation expectations surveyed by Gerin have also been converging to the 12-month ahead inflation targets.",
        "The Copom inflation forecast for the same period is below this figure.",
        "However, there are still risks to setting inflation on a path consistent with the target trajectory, especially with respect to the speed of disinflation.",
        "The Copom has continuously evaluated the degree of inflation persistence in recent months.",
        "One of the analytic methods consists of comparing the models that are currently used with other specifications that adopt a higher degree of persistence.",
        "It was observed that the current models forecasted May inflation with more accuracy, which may be the first hint that the degree of inflation persistence is returning to the historical average.",
        "The asymmetrical impact on prices of the exchange rates appreciation and depreciation was analyzed in the same way.",
        "The conclusion was that the models that incorporate less impact due to exchange rate appreciations, compared to exchange rate depreciations, signaled market price inflation above the one that was effective in May.",
        "Due to the recent slowdown in inflation, the Copom believes that the stance of monetary policy should ensure that the recent disinflation trend is sustained.",
        "The negative performance was generalized, and hit all the retail sectors and 24 out of Brazils 27 states.",
        "After consecutive falls in recent months, data on sales with checks and credit purchases, released by the ACSP, stabilized in May, although at a low level.",
        "Despite the negative retail sales results, the monthly FecomrcioSP survey showed a recovery in consumer confidence for the third consecutive month in June, signaling better prospects for the sector.",
        "The main investment indices showed weak performance in April, still highlighting that the difficult economic scenario and the government transition postponed investment decisions, both in the public and the private sectors.",
        "Medium and long term financing provided by the BNDES, another indicator of the evolution investment expenditures, was below the level observed in the same period last year.",
        "Both the month-on-month and year-on-year results for April should be judged with caution however.",
        "The number of working days in March 2003 was lower than normal due to the Carnival holidays.",
        "Data on manufacturing and real industrial sales released by the CNI showed a reduction in industrial activity in the first four months of the year.",
        "The fall in interest rates charged by financial institutions was driven mainly by a decline in rates on fixed-income credits, which was partially offset by an increase in rates for dollar-indexed credits.",
        "Projections for economic growth in 2003 continue to be reduced.",
        "In the US, the latest indicators reinforce the hypothesis of a slow economic recovery, and there are risks that the recovery may not be sustainable.",

        "This positive outcome is mainly the result of monetary initiatives that impeded the propagation of the shocks that occurred at the end of 2002, and to consistency in fiscal policy.",
        "These factors, together with a more favorable international environment, led to an exchange rate appreciation in the period and to a convergence of inflation expectations to the path of the targets.",
        "The significant drop of inflation illustrated by the results of the IPCA in June and the IPCA-15 in July provides evidence of the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing inflation persistence, and preventing its continuation at high levels.",
        "Additionally, these results strengthen the perception that the convergence of inflation to the targets is occurring more rapidly than had been observed up to April.",
        "These numbers benefited from several conjunctural and seasonal factors, such as declines in gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and food prices.",

        "The Copom has compared its inflation forecasts from the model currently in use with an alternative model that adopts a higher degree of inflation persistence.",
        "The inflation forecasts for the second quarter of 2003 adopting the current model were more precise, which provides more evidence that the degree of inflation persistence is converging towards its historical mean.",
        "If the recent trend of inflation persists, real interest rates should converge to lower levels in the future.",

        "Even though there is no sufficient information to a precise diagnosis about the factors that caused the surge in inflation in December and the increase in inflation expectations in the JanuaryFebruary period, some signals suggest that this trend may persist.",
        "Firstly, as already outlined, core inflation and partial inflation figures for January do not anticipate an inflation slowdown.",
        "The increase in wholesale prices was triggered by several factors, including increases in world commodity prices; higher demand for intermediate goods; and the change in relative prices that has benefited sectors more directly favored by the growth in demand, thus enabling increases in profit margins.",
        "Historical data show an important statistical correlation between those intentions and industrial wholesale prices.",
        "The recent appreciation of the real against the dollar is, undoubtedly, an important factor to be considered.",

        "If no exogenous factors trigger those reductions, it is assumed that monetary policy will be responsible for producing the compensatory effect.",

        "The volatility of industrial output neither allows the interpretation of a surprisingly positive monthly figure as a definitive evidence of acceleration in the growth trend, nor does it mean that the marginal accommodation is a clear sign that the expansion has lost momentum.",
        "In fact, August was the sixth consecutive month of growth in the seasonally adjusted industrial output series.",
        "Such a long monotonic growth had not been observed since 1994, as the presence of some cyclical fluctuations around the underlying trend is the most common behavior, even during periods of strong activity expansion.",

        "The IBGEs retail survey confirmed the expansion of personal consumption.",
        "The concern expressed in past Copom Minutes about the pace of supply growth in order to accommodate the increasing demand without triggering inflation pressures is again emphazised.",
        "Not only did the current prices increase, but also the perspectives that prices will remain in high levels for a longer period strengthened.",
        "The risks are enhanced by the likelihood that, in face of a sustained increase in oil prices, there is a reduction in the current unusual lag in international gasoline prices.",
        "As to the domestic scenario, it is still indefinite the realignment of oil by-products prices to international prices, which increases the probability that such a realignment considering that it can be postponed, but not avoided could contaminate with greater intensity the 2005 inflation rate.",
        "Besides, a mere postponement would reduce the monetary policy effectiveness, as it expands the time horizon in which private agents expect an imminent inflationary shock, of uncertain magnitude, requiring higher nominal interest rates in order to produce the same expected real interest rate.",
        "In the benchmark scenario, the Copom maintains unchanged its projections for 2004 domestic gasoline prices; for 2005, the Copom assumes the projections generated by the endogenous determination model for regulated prices.",
        "The Committee has been carefully pondering that international oil prices face a more adverse environment than the current one, but still regard it as a potential risk, though increasingly higher, for the materialization of the benchmark scenario.",
        "The Copom will soon produce disaggregate projections for gasoline prices in 2005, as well as for the other regulated prices, when it will reassess the extent to which more adverse circumstances in the oil market should be incorporated into the assumptions of the benchmark scenario.",
        "The international capital markets started to express greater concerns about the growth dynamics in the main economies.",
        "This uncertainty was triggered by the hike in oil prices, and resulted in greater market volatility, with immediate effects on the Brazilian foreign exchange market.",
        "The favorable scenario that enabled the Real appreciation since last June could be harmed in the case of a larger deterioration of oil prices and its uncertain impact over the world economy growth.",
        "This reduction is a result of the below-than-expected September inflation rate, caused by the transitory factors already discussed.",
        "The deterioration of 2005 inflation expectations has not stopped yet, despite the current favorable trend of inflation, the exchange rate appreciation, the recent fall of important commodity prices and the signaling of a monetary tightening in the last few months.",
        "Once more, the Copom emphasizes that the monetary policy adjustment is based on its own inflation scenarios, and are not conducted by inflation expectations of private agents.",
        "However, private sector expectations have an important impact on monetary policy effectiveness, as they affect the expected real interest rates corresponding to a certain nominal yield curve and, given demand conditions, they significantly influence price-makers decisions.",
        "Because of this relevance, inflation expectations are monitored by the Copom and by monetary authorities worldwide, whichever the degree of accuracy.",
        "The Copom projections for the 2004 IPCA fell, mainly due to the favorable September result.",
        "For 2005, the projections in both scenarios stand close to the values presented in the September issue of the Inflation Report.",
        "The Copom reiterates that it considers natural for the economic growth pace to spontaneously slow down, as the initial monetary impulse loses momentum and the economy becomes to be sustained on auto propagation mechanisms linked to income increases.",
        "Although some spontaneous slowdown may be in course, the available data do not suggest that it is intense enough to preserve the compatibility between the inflation targets and the productive capacity.",
        "Despite the difficulties in measuring the installed capacity of each industry, or, in aggregate terms, the potential output, it is undeniable that the idle capacity has quickly lessened in the last few months.",
        "Considering the production levels recently achieved, the monetary stance has to carefully accommodate the marginal expansion of demand.",
        "Preventing the inflation increase is also essential to perverse labor income, thus maintaining a sound and balanced recovery process.",
        "The main objective of the adjustment in monetary policy is, therefore, to ensure sustainable growth conditions.",
        "As a consequence, the Copom understands that the current circumstances recommend the continuity of the process initiated in September, of a moderate adjustment in the Over-Selic rate.",
        "Although an increase of 0.25 p.p.",
        "had been considered adequate to begin this adjustment, as to smooth the inflexion of the monetary stance and minimize its initial turbulence risks, the Committee evaluates that, at this moment, a 0.5 p.p.",
        "rise is more adequate with the magnitude and the speed required to promote the convergence of the inflation rate to the targets path.",
        "Even though the Copom assumes that the monetary adjustment will be carried out in the magnitude and the pace originally set up, the current scenario holds two potential new risks.",
        "First, the increase in oil prices, in terms of magnitude and in terms of extent.",
        "Second, the marginal deterioration of market inflation expectations for 2005, even after the adjustment in the monetary stance, is an alert of its possible downward rigidity.",
        "Fabric, clothing, shoes, furniture, electrical appliances, vehicles, motorcycles and parts, which had been showing expressive growth rates in the year, presented a decrease in the month, while super and hypermarkets sales remained high, considering the seasonally adjusted series.",

        "However, as occurred in the non-tradable items group, this increase is due to the school fees behavior.",
        "Economic indicators available so far suggest that there has been a sustained economic growth path at the beginning of the year.",
        "Due to the significant growth in the last quarter of 2003, it is likely that the GDP data in the first quarter of 2004 indicate a cooling down on economic activity.",
        "Semi and non-durable goods output presented growth for the first time since last September, suggesting that growth recorded in the other sectors of economy has been influencing this sector, which had not presented recovery so far, through the marginal increase in employment and real earnings.",
        "Quarterly moving average behavior has presented a continuous industrial output growth, although in lower rates than the ones recorded in the last quarter of For February, considering previous indicators, it is not possible to discard a fall in the industrial production, which is perfectly compatible with the usual patterns of a sustained growth recovery, with short-term oscillations around the trend.",
        "Moreover, in February there were only eighteen working days, as against twenty working days in the same month of 2003, harming the comparison against the same month in In addition, in two out of the five last years, Carnival was in March, which may affect the seasonal adjustment of the series.",

        "After three consecutive months of deterioration, inflation expectations for the first quarter of 2004 dropped, according to a survey conducted by the Investor Relations Group Gerin.",
        "As in previous meetings, the Copom also examined the projections produced according to the same methodology, and according to the same benchmark and market scenarios for the interest and exchange rates paths, taking into account the Top 5 short-term inflation expectations for March and hence, projecting inflation for the following months.",
        "In this exercise, considering the benchmark scenario, the projected inflation for 2004 is slightly above the target, and for 2005, it is bellow the target.",
        "However, the projected inflation for 2004 and 2005 are below the February results for the same exercise, due to the substitution of the lower figure effectively observed for the expected inflation of the Top 5 forecasters for the month of February, to the reduction of expected inflation by those institutions for March and to the reasons mentioned in the paragraph above, regarding the GDP performance in 2003, the reduction in the projection for the regulated prices for 2004 and the downwards improvement of the 12-months-ahead inflation expectations.",
        "According to the same methodology, the projected inflation for the market scenario is above the 2004 and 2005 targets, although lower than the ones projected in February, due to the same reasons mentioned above.",
        "The Copom also evaluated a third set of scenarios, which supposes lower inflation persistence.",
        "These scenarios consider the hypothesis under which part of the high inflation of the first quarter of the year will not impact the following quarters and that there could even be a reversion in the inflation increases that occurred in the period due to momentary unfavorable weather conditions.",
        "This hypothesis becomes more likely the more efficient the monetary policy is in exercising its coordinating role, preventing punctual inflation increases caused by supply shocks, by seasonal factors and by attempts to restore margins from contaminating inflation expectations.",
        "For this hypothesis the Copom considered that part of inflation in the first quarter was due to a seasonal shock and that other shocks of the same fashion will also affect inflation in each quarter of the year and in The magnitude of each quarterly typical shock was estimated to reproduce, in the Copom projection models, the same seasonal standard observed in the recent series of free prices.",
        "As in the exercise described in the previous paragraph, the inflation of the first quarter is the one expected by the short-term Top 5 institutions.",
        "According to this procedure, considering the benchmark scenario exchange and interest rates trajectories, the forecast inflations for 2004 and 2005 are below the targets.",
        "When market expected exchange and interest rates are considered, inflation remains above the target for 2004, although closer to the target value than in the exercise that only encompasses the expectations of the Top 5 institutions for the first quarter, and the inflation for 2005 remains unchanged.",
        "Moreover, it was consensual that the evaluation of this more favorable scenario is a result of the recent monetary policy decisions, which have been mitigating the pass-through from the rises in industrial costs to retail costs and the second order effects of inflationary surprises of January and February.",
        "The conduction of the monetary policy at the beginning of the year was decisive to revert the environment in which the leading sectors in the economic rebound could pressure prices upward, expecting that demand conditions would absorb the increases.",
        "Therefore, the risk of higher inflation diminished while the risk of unsustained economic activity remained low.",
        "It was also consensual the interpretation that the main risk for consumer inflation in the next months consists on the contamination of the increases of wholesale industrial prices to retail prices.",
        "It is important to notice that this element is not incorporated into any of the projected scenarios analyzed above, except for the limited effects on the results of the IPCA for the first quarter, since there is no perceptible signal of transmission through any other channel, such as market expectations for the IPCA during the next quarters.",
        "The experience of the last years suggests that when the industrial IPA pass-through influences the part of IPCA represented by the industrialized products, it is usually fast.",
        "In this sense, the recent results of the deceleration of consumer prices are quite encouraging, despite the acceleration of the wholesale prices.",
        "The usual high speed of this pass-through enables to foresee that the remaining uncertainties about the increase in consumer prices as a result of pressures caused by wholesale prices will soon be solved.",
        "Great part of the increase in wholesale prices in the last months can be explained by supply shocks, among which the different impacts caused by the Cofins ratio and levies throughout the productive chains and the increase in the international price of some commodities and intermediate inputs.",
        "There are still no elements allowing for a satisfactorily accurate measure of the magnitude of the potential impact of these shocks over the consumer prices, although there are preliminary indications, for example, that the effect of the Cofins may be small.",
        "Economic theory and the best monetary policy practice recommend the partial accommodation of increases in consumer prices caused by supply shocks.",
        "The Copom understands that the current circumstances do not recommend the adoption of procedures willing to accommodate the recent supply shocks.",
        "These members recommended greater caution in the conduct of the monetary policy in the short term, proposing that eventual cuts in the target for the Over-Selic rate should be left for a subsequent moment, when there may be additional evidences that the higher inflation rates of January and February might not contaminate the inflation of the following months and when the impact of the recent increases in the wholesale prices over the future dynamics of the consumer prices may not be significant.",
        "This caution would increase the probability of both a steady anchorage of the inflationary expectations and the behavior of the price-makers to consolidate a favorable level of inflation, such as the one considered by the scenarios of low inflation persistence analyzed by the Copom.",
        "However, for most part of the members of the Copom, the immediate fall of the Over-Selic rate in 0.25 p.p can be justified by the recent behavior of the price indices, the lower inflation expectation for both the short-term and the next twelve months and the low intensity of the wholesale passthrough to the retail prices.",
        "These considerations indicate that the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate in January and February was enough to increase the probability of materialization of low inflationary persistence scenarios considered by the Committee, moving away the danger that the inflation increase recorded from December to February could contaminate inflation expectations and provoke a change in the inflationary dynamics.",
        "Therefore, this easing of the monetary policy reflects the necessary caution in the administration of the risks between inflation and the continuity of the restore of the economic activity.",
        "This result reflected the decrease not only in the present but also in the future consumption intentions.",
        "However, the result of 115.8, in a scale ranging from 0 to 200, reflects an overall positive sentiment, although weaker, mainly regarding future consumption intentions.",
        "The increase in the capital goods production spread over all sectors, except for transport equipment.",

        "In the FX markets, there is a consensus about the continuity of the dollar depreciation due to the increasing U.S. current account deficit.",
        "The dollar depreciation together with the disequilibrium provoked by strong Chinese demand has been affecting commodity prices, which reached high levels in February.",
        "However, other factors have been contributing to prices increase, such as the crisis in Venezuela, the low levels of U.S. stocks of gasoline, and recently, the unpredictable effects of the Madrid events.",
        "In addition to the political scenario, other factors contributed to this movement, such as the 2003 GDP and the January industrial production results, the United States labor market data, inflation indices released showing different behavior between consumer and wholesale prices, and the lower market expectations for the next twelve months IPCA.",
        "However, despite the volatility observed, on March 16 the yield curve had already returned to a level similar to the one observed on February Comparing both dates, the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year interest rates decreased 0.06 p.p., 0.08 p.p.",

        "After a significant fall in the first half of 2003, industrial production presented strong growth in the second half of the year.",
        "An excessive monetary easing with the objective of pushing these specific sectors forward would intensify, in the short run, the recovery gaps amongst sectors, and would allow for inflationary pressures to arise from leading sectors.",
        "Volatility around the underlying output trend is normal in periods of economic recovery.",
        "This volatility does not indicate that the economic rebound process is losing steam, especially because the monetary easing that took place in the second half of 2003 has not yet fully materialized.",

        "It is justified to expect that this seasonal behavior persists and that the February inflation shows some reversion in relation to January.",
        "Preliminary evidence of an inflation deceleration can be found in the partial results of the IPC-Fipe and the weekly IPC-S. For the IPCS, however, inflation persists at a high level; for the IPC-Fipe, the reduction was more intense, and yet, due to the reasons described in paragraph 2 above, this pattern may not be the same for the IPCA.",
        "Second, inflation measured by the Industrial IPA remained high and accelerated, influenced by an increase in some commodities prices, by a higher demand for inputs and by the relative price realignment, favoring the sectors that benefited from stronger demand.",
        "Although a higher wholesale inflation will not necessarily be transmitted to consumers with the same intensity, a higher passthrough would happen as a consequence of the perception of a lenient monetary policy and of an over-optimistic scenario produced by the recovery of certain sectors.",
        "Consequently, and considering the uncertainties about the magnitude and the lags on the output gap and on inflation of the 10 p.p.",
        "reduction in the Over-Selic rate that took place from June to December, the Copom maintains the January minutes diagnosis, that there is a real likelihood that inflation deviates from the target, requiring an extra concern in monetary policymaking.",
        "The balance between the risks of inflation deviating from the target and the interruption in the economy recovery process has not changed significantly since January.",
        "Resuming monetary easing prematurely can significantly increase the risk that actual inflation deviates from the target, which could force a change in monetary stance in the medium run, with strong interest rates movements and a significant effect on economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, an unchanged OverSelic rate causes a substantial lower risk of damaging the process of economy recovery.",

        "Although tension in the oil market has lessened, there are still uncertainties regarding the expected path of the fed funds rate in the U.S.\nMarket inflation expectations deserved special attention by the members of the Copom.",
        "In a scenario of temporary shocks affecting the inflation path, it would be more reasonable to observe a sharper deterioration in inflation expectations in shorter horizons, when the first order effects are concentrated and monetary policy effectiveness is limited.",
        "The Committee members share the conviction that the magnitude of the deterioration observed for longer horizons is not compatible with the view that, in the presence of eventual supply shocks of a more permanent nature, the monetary policy will not accommodate its secondary effects.",
        "Such deterioration is also not compatible with the inflation forecasts produced by the different models used by the Copom, even if these projections take into account particularly unfavorable scenarios to the evolution of the main determinants of the recent shocks.",
        "Considering the inflation in April and May, and the non-usual increase of market-prices inflation in May, the Copom assessed with greater emphasis the inflation projections made without the assumption of low persistence.",
        "The current uncertainties concerning the external scenario have been responsible for a short-term volatility that tends to increase inflation uncertainty.",
        "As a consequence, the coordination of private agent's inflation expectations became more difficult.",

        "Considering the hypothesis that important external variables continue under pressure for a longer period, the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime could judiciously absorb the primary shocks associated with this pressure.",
        "However, it would be paramount for monetary policy to fight the second order effects of these shocks.",

        "Commodities prices fell in May, but the upward trend prevailing until the end of March has kept prices above their historical average.",
        "Oil price pressures continued up to the beginning of June, mainly as a result of political tensions in the Middle East and of high global demand.",
        "Money Market and Open Market Operations Over the past weeks, there has been high volatility in the yield curves.",
        "On the other hand, the 1-year and 2-year rates have decreased 0.16 p.p.",
        "Due to market volatility, the National Treasury did not carry out any selling auction of LTNs in the period.",
        "However, simultaneous buying and selling auctions were carried out on May 20 and 21, aiming at giving liquidity to these securities when prices presented more volatility.",
        "The BCB also carried out in this period 13 fixed rate repos falling due between 1 and 4 working days.",
        "Regarding the IPCA, the reduction of the monthly change was mainly due to the smaller impact of the school fees readjustment in the month.",
        "This readjustment was the main factor of pressure in February.",
        "Regarding regulated prices, there has recently been above-than-expected price increases in certain items.",
        "In addition to this item, recent announcements of price readjustments of electricity in Minas Gerais and Pernambuco are also above previously expected.",
        "These increases consider inflation-indexed costs, price increases due to investments in the distribution and a part of the 2003 readjustment that is being applied this year.",
        "In the first group, the rise of tradable goods prices contributed 0.27 p.p.",
        "for the IPCA monthly change, while non-tradable goods contributed with 0.22 p.p.",
        "Regarding regulated prices, the negative change was due to the reduction of fuel prices, which prevailed over the increases of water and sewage tariffs and bottled gas prices.",
        "However, the prices of rice, cattle and sugar cane remained in a downward trend.",
        "As occurred with the full IPCA, the 12-month accumulated core indices registered in March the lowest changes since the end of 2002, despite being above the full IPCA change.",

        "In contrast with the deceleration of the headline index, the various core IPCA measures calculated under the trimmed-mean method increased in March, reversing the February fall.",
        "It should be noted that increases in the measures of core inflation and inflation dispersion could be justified as a consequence of recent increases in wholesale prices, even if the pass-through remains moderate, as expected, and compatible with a favorable inflation scenario.",
        "This fall, anticipated in the March minutes, is fully consistent with usual economic recovery cycles and is related to the sharp rebound of the second half of The recovery was fast and intense, which became clear in the new industrial output series released in April by the IBGE.",

        "Although inflation in the first quarter was higher than expected, market expectations remained relatively stable.",
        "The small increase in expected inflation is mainly due to the incorporation of the January-March actual rates.",
        "The effect on expectations to 2004 was marginal, as expectations remained satisfactorily anchored.",
        "Copom considered BCBs inflation projections under the hypothesis of a low degree of persistence of the first quarter inflation, following the seasonal inflation pattern observed in the last years.",
        "The market scenario projects higher inflation rates than the benchmarked scenario because it assumes a declining trend for the interest rate, as well as a small increase of the exchange rate.",
        "The Copom evaluated that the cautious monetary stance has been essential to increase the likelihood of inflation converging to the target.",
        "Accordingly, inflation indicators must continue consistent with the low inflation-persistence hypothesis that has been considered.",
        "The monetary stance is different during crises periods, such as the one observed at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, or during times of greater macroeconomic stability, as the one recently established.",
        "Therefore, when the crisis is reverted, as the interest rate is still considerably high, interest rate cuts are larger.",
        "However, a different interest rate dynamics should take place during times of greater macroeconomic stability, when inflation convergence to the targeted path, along with sustained economic recovery, should be monitored more carefully.",
        "The Committee stresses that it is pointless to infer that the more moderate cut of interest rate corresponds to a negative evaluation about the future behavior of inflation, or that it should cause pessimism about the future path of economic activity.",
        "On the contrary, a natural result of the progressive normalization of the economic environment is precisely the fall in the average interest rate cuts.",
        "In addition to allowing further monetary easing, this procedure enables a smooth transition to a scenario of price stability with economic growth, with smaller market interest rates volatility in the medium run.",
        "The statistics concerning the output and sales in February 2004 should be analyzed with caution, once that in this year, differently from the previous year, Carnival holidays happened in February.",
        "These distortions may not be completely eliminated with the application of usual seasoning adjustment procedures and tend to diminish February 2004 results and increase those of March.",
        "The result reflects the decrease of both present and future consumption intentions.",
        "Considering categories of use, this movement was generalized, with higher intensity in the productions of durable consumption goods and capital goods, which had been increasing in the last six months.",
        "Therefore, the negative results in February reflect mostly the last months production high level.",

        "Regarding oil, pressure over prices is also a result of the increase in the tensions in Iraq.",
        "The main factors that contributed to the slowdown movement of the short part of the curve were the reduction of the Over-Selic Target and the favorable expectations of the inflation trajectory.",
        "This movement was partially reverted by the fact that the IPCA and its cores were above market expectations.",

        "The inter-harvest period was responsible for specific pressures on the prices of milk and dairy products.",
        "Potatoes, sugar, black beans, wheat flour and bread also suffered price increases, while soy oil, vegetables, carioca beans and rice prices fell.",
        "The deceleration of market prices inflation was disseminated in both food and non-food prices.",
        "Regarding regulated prices, besides gasoline, alcohol-fuel, electricity and fixed telephone prices, road tolls and urban and interstate buses fares also contributed to the rise.",
        "The IPA-DI deceleration in July reflected lower rises in both agricultural and industrial prices.",
        "This reduction was a consequence of the decrease in prices of cereals and export-oriented crops, as well as lower pressures from the prices of animals and by-products, vegetables, fruit and vegetal oils.",
        "Other segments that registered lower changes in July, compared to June, include mechanical, electrical material, leather, personal care, and tobacco.",
        "In August, consumer-prices inflation should fall, mainly due to lower regulated-prices inflation.",
        "Regarding wholesale inflation, a deceleration is also expected as anticipated by the results of the IGP-10 and the first ten-day period of the IGP-M, notwithstanding the continuity of specific adjustments due to increases in international commodity prices.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information.",
        "As to the wholesale inflation, there has been some deceleration since June, both in the agricultural and industrial segments, even though it has remained high.",
        "Although this has been the lowest rate since February 2004, it is incompatible with the medium-term inflation targets.",
        "Economic activity has continued to grow vigorously, as proved by different production, sales and employment indicators.",
        "The CNI data have continued to point out a higher growth pace for industrial sales than for industrial production.",

        "Meanwhile, the sectors more sensitive to credit conditions, that have led the economic rebound, have not yet shown any accommodation in the growth pace.",
        "On the other hand, capacity utilization in the intermediate goods industry remained flat in the period, in the range between the average and the historical peak, an interval much narrower than in other sectors.",
        "The consolidation of this trend is crucial for the economy to broaden its growth potential.",
        "At this stage, however, it is particularly difficult to project the output gap, in an environment of a sharp expansion of demand, as has been observed in the last few quarters.",
        "Evidence that the U.S. economy may be growing below what was previously expected, with weaker inflationary pressures, lessened the risk of a faster monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.",
        "As a consequence, market volatility has diminished in the last few weeks, what contributed to the maintenance of the Brazilian sovereign risk below 600 basis points.",
        "Oil prices are the main concern in the external front.",
        "The recent trend reinforces the fears that oil prices may reach and persist for a longer period of time at higher levels than the ones recently considered as the most likely scenario, even if some reversion in relation to the recent hikes occurs.",
        "This benign scenario has been sustained due to the diagnosis that part of the recent volatility in oil prices is due to speculative factors that may dissipate, even in the presence of some geopolitical risks.",
        "These risks may cause a higher-than-expected increase in gasoline prices in 2004, or a greater lag between domestic and international prices to be corrected in Moreover, regardless of the evolution of domestic gasoline prices, the increase in international oil prices is transmitted to the domestic economy, partly through the intermediate productive chains, such as the petrochemical, and also through the deterioration in inflation expectations of the private sector.",
        "The Copoms inflation projections, both in the benchmark and in the market scenarios, have slightly increased compared to last month.",
        "The Copom also assessed a third hybrid scenario, considering an unchanged Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate path expected by the market.",
        "Compared to the market scenario, inflation projections were identical for 2004 and slightly below for As in previous meetings, the Committee also analyzed the inflation projections for the next 12 months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of The projected inflation for this period, both in the benchmark and market scenarios, stood above the interval between the central inflation targets for 2004 and The strong and continuous economic rebound, which already reaches historical highs, requires extra caution in the conduct of monetary policy, aimed at preserving the balance between aggregate supply and demand.",
        "The level of capacity utilization has rapidly increased, approaching historical records in some sectors.",
        "Recent data for capital goods domestic absorption and for civil construction activity indicate that fixed capital investment is recovering.",
        "However, during periods of reversion in the economic activity cycle, in which fast expansion follow the slow and erratic growth pattern of the last few years, it is natural to have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the speed of growth of the productive capacity in sectors whose current levels of capacity utilization are already high, and also regarding the potential growth trend.",
        "In this scenario, with the fast increase in aggregate demand, it is fundamental to carefully assess the risk of an eventual narrowing of the output gap.",
        "In the previous Copoms meetings, the Committees members stressed that the maintenance of the current Over-Selic rate for a long period would consolidate a favorable inflation scenario, with the convergence of the actual inflation rate to the inflation targets.",
        "However, the monetary authority admitted that a more active policy stance could be adopted if inflation projections deviated from the targets, due to an eventual deterioration of the underlying factors that led to the increase in inflation projections.",
        "The first one is the increase in oil prices.",
        "The possibility of a higher and longer rise in oil prices than previously projected, not accompanied by an adjustment of the monetary policy, could produce second-order effects incompatible with the inflation-targeting regime.",
        "The second factor, partially a consequence of the increase in oil prices, is the deterioration of inflation expectations for 2005, which had been steady for some time.",
        "As the scenario is not consolidated yet, the Copom will be cautious to the new developments of these factors.",
        "Even if the inflationary scenario should require an adjustment of the Over-Selic rate in the future, it is important to reiterate that it should not impact the sustainable growth process of the Brazilian economy.",
        "On the contrary, monetary policy contributes to growth by fighting second-order effects of the supply shocks, and by promoting the balance between the expansion of aggregate demand and the broadening of the economys productive capacity.",
        "Moreover, sustaining inflation in a path consistent with the inflation targets is essential to preserve real earnings, fundamental for the continuous and balanced expansion of the domestic demand, and for the dissemination of the economic growth benefits to the population.",
        "The regional distribution of growth was generalized, encompassing all States in the country, except Roraima.",
        "This increase was due to improved future expectations by consumers.",
        "Out of the 23 activities surveyed, 13 registered increases in output, while out of the 4 categories, 3 expanded.",
        "Transportation material and pharmaceutical products are the only two industries that remain below the respective historical average.",
        "The FGV survey and the CNI business sentiment survey pointed out improved confidence in July.",

        "In July, leading indicators anticipate a continued expansion in industrial output.",
        "The default rate measured by the ACSP fell in July to the lowest level of the year.",
        "External Environment Recent indicators suggested some deceleration of the world economy growth, partially attributed to oil prices increases.",
        "In the U.S., the Federal Reserve decided to raise the target for the fed funds rate by 25 b.p., considering that the weaker activity level in June and July was transitory, owing primordially to the rise in energy prices, and that the economy was prepared to resume a stronger pace of expansion in the near future.",
        "The continuous increases in oil prices posed risks to global economic growth and price stability, as well as limited the recovery of asset prices.",
        "The determinant factor justifying the yield curve move was the markets interpretation about the July Copoms minutes, but international markets volatility and some internal political noises also contributed for the move.",
        "From July 21 to August 18, the spread on the 3-month and 6-month rates in relation to the Over-Selic rate increased 0.13 p.p.",
        "and 0.38 p.p., respectively, while the 1-year and the 2-year rates increased 0.56 p.p.",
        "The BCB also carried out in this period 16 fixed rate overnight repos.",
        "The higher frequency of these operations after July 28 enabled the reduction of the gap between the OverSelic rate and its target, from 0.25 p.p.",
        "In July, the net securitized domestic public debt was stable.",
        "The IPCA diffusion index has shown an increase in the number of items with positive price rises.",
        "The persistence of high core inflation and the recent behavior of the diffusion index indicate the dissemination of price increases across several sectors of the economy.",
        "In December, the IPCA should persist at a relatively high level.",
        "Further increases of fuel-alcohol prices, the readjustment of gasoline prices announced on November 26, and the urban bus fare increases in Recife and Belo Horizonte should be emphasized.",
        "Among market prices, the favorable contribution of food might be lower, mainly due to fresh products prices.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information.",
        "This acceleration was mainly due to regulated price increases, especially fuel prices.",
        "This acceleration happened despite the decline in household food prices for the third consecutive month.",
        "This wholesale price inflation continues to represent a potential pressure on consumer prices in the coming months.",
        "The intensity of the pass-through will depend on prospective demand conditions and market inflation expectations; the evidence that this transmission has not happened yet with the intensity and velocity observed in the past does not mean that the pressure has definitely vanished.",
        "IPCA core inflation continued to accelerate in November, according to the three criteria by excluding regulated prices and household food, by smoothed and by non-smoothed trimmed-means.",
        "The cores remain at levels incompatible with the medium-run inflation targets.",
        "The significant activity rebound mentioned in the Copom Minutes during the year, based on monthly indicators of industrial output, sales, and employment, was ratified by the third quarter GDP result.",
        "Industry was the sector that increased most according to both criteria.",
        "The GDP data also confirmed that growth is being supported by domestic demand.",
        "This decline, however, was lower than suggested by the behavior of leading and coincident industrial indicators.",
        "Industry has shown an already anticipated qualitative change, being stimulated progressively by the sectors that are more income sensitive.",
        "Leading and coincident indicators for November anticipate a new decline in the industrial output seasonally adjusted series.",
        "However, as discussed in previous Copom Minutes, this specific performance does not signal a reversion in the industrial output growth trend, as a strong isolated increase cannot be considered as an indicator of acceleration in production.",
        "After a sequence of growth rates as witnessed in the recent past, it is reasonable to observe some temporary accommodation, since industrial activity rates are volatile, with short-run variations around the growth trend.",
        "The variation of the number of working days makes the analysis of the monthly economic activity data even more difficult, particularly regarding industrial output.",
        "In October 2004 there were only 20 working days, compared to 23 working days in the same month of 2003 and an average of 21.5 in the last eleven years, distorting both the comparison between years and the seasonally adjusted data series.",
        "The correction of this distortion is not trivial, because the number of working days obviously affects industries that produce only on these days, though there is no direct impact for the industries with continuous production cycles.",
        "The same problem will happen in December, but inversely, because the month will have 23 working days compared to only 21 in Thus, recent monthly activity indicators will be clearer just after the release of new data in the coming months.",
        "The labor market has continued to improve significantly.",
        "According to quarterly moving averages, the sales of automobiles and motorcycles, along with supermarket sales, continued to grow, while the sales of appliances and furniture, and fabric, clothes and shoes decreased.",
        "However, appliances and furniture, and vehicles and motorcycles continue to present the highest growth rates over twelve months.",
        "Due to the significant activity expansion in recent quarters, the performance of aggregate supply in the coming quarters continues to be an important concern for the Copom.",
        "Investment performance has been promising, though the level of capacity utilization remains high.",
        "The CNI installed capacity index declined in October for the second consecutive month in seasonally adjusted terms, after reaching an historical high in August.",
        "The different output gap measures continued to narrow, even after the inclusion of the third quarter GDP data.",
        "Thus, monetary policy has to continue monitoring the additional expansion of demand.",
        "The external trade surplus has remained robust despite the increase in domestic activity.",
        "In a more favorable global environment, the Brazilian country risk premium continued to decline and the BRL appreciated against the dollar.",
        "Actually, in 2004, liquidity remained favorable, except for a short period in the second quarter, when the markets expected a change in the Feds stance.",
        "Since the end of 2003, the Copom has been working with a scenario of a low probability of abrupt movements in the U.S. fed funds rate, which actually happened.",
        "The continuity of this favorable environment will depend on new economic data for industrialized economies, especially the United States, and on international oil prices.",
        "The recent exchange rate moves represent an additional concern, since a process of disorderly adjustment, which is not likely to happen, would cause significant instability in the international financial markets.",
        "In the beginning of December, the Central Bank resumed the purchase of foreign currency.",
        "As emphasized in a Communiqu released last January, the BCB aims at increasing the countrys international reserves in the medium-run and not at attaining any quantitative target.",
        "This policy will continue to be based on liquidity conditions, and will objective not to add volatility to the exchange rate market and not to interfere in the floating exchange rate trend.",
        "This process should be understood, therefore, as an effort to rebuild international reserves in an inflationtargeting regime with a floating exchange rate.",
        "It should not be understood as the establishment of other targets, such as a ceiling or a floor to the foreign exchange rate.",
        "The BCB has also achieved, since May 2003, extremely positive results regarding the decrease of the share of the public debt linked to the exchange rate.",
        "After reaching record levels in October, international oil prices have fallen; nevertheless, they still remain at high levels.",
        "Oil price prospects remain highly uncertain, primarily due to uncertainties regarding the continuity and the magnitude of the recent price correction.",
        "In any case, the reduction in oil prices since October supports the Copom forecasting scenario, which treats the sharp oil price deterioration as a latent risk and not as a baseline scenario hypothesis.",
        "On the domestic front, the Copom projects that there will be no fuel price adjustments in If a more favorable international oil price scenario materializes, it is possible that there may actually be downward adjustments to domestic oil product prices next year.",
        "Nevertheless, this improvement could be considered relatively modest in light of the recent developments that reduced inflationary pressures for the next year, such as signs of moderation in the pace of economic growth, the exchange rate appreciation, the reduction of important international commodity prices, and unequivocal signs of a more restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "The Copom inflation projections for 2004 increased mainly due to the end-of-November adjustment in gasoline prices.",
        "Since September, the deviation between the Copom inflation projections and the inflation target has narrowed.",
        "In order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targeted path, the Copom members determined that the gradual interest rate adjustment process should continue at the originally foreseen pace.",
        "The Committee assumes that the combination of the ongoing adjustment process followed by a sufficiently long period of unchanged interest rates should significantly reduce the likelihood that the future inflation path diverges from the targets.",
        "As stressed in the November Minutes, the Committee emphasizes that the persistence of the monetary adjustment process in the originally foreseen pace and magnitude requires that there is not an exacerbation of the risk factors that the Committee has closely monitored in the recent months, and that there is not an interruption in the process of convergence of the private sector inflation expectations to the inflation targets.",
        "The Copom will be prepared to change the pace and magnitude of the monetary adjustment process if it assesses that there are risks for the inflation to deviate from the target path.",
        "Hyper and supermarket sales maintained their growth trend, while the sales of fuel and of fabric, clothing and shoes fell in the month in seasonally adjusted terms.",
        "Furniture and electrical appliances, which had been showing notable growth rates in the year, expanded again in October after falling in September.",
        "The year-on-year growth in retail sales occurred in 25 out of the 27 states in the country.",
        "The sharp jump in exports was driven by the sale of a domestically-produced oil exploration platform-ship, which remained leased in the country.",
        "Considering the quarterly moving average, industrial output recorded an historic high in October, slightly above the level recorded in September The breakdown of industrial output data showed the October decline was a result of the performance of 14 out of the 23 activities, seasonally adjusted.",
        "The most notable declines were in the sectors of food, rubber and plastic, vehicles, and perfumes.",
        "The sectors that demonstrated notable growth were oil refining and alcohol production, chemical products, machines and electrical materials and metallurgy.",
        "Regarding the use categories, capital and durable goods production recorded the most important declines, although these categories have recorded the greatest expansion along the year.",

        "Similarly to what happened in the past, the recent acceleration in industrial wholesale prices shall impact consumer inflation over the next few months.",
        "The intensity of this pass-through will depend on final demand conditions.",
        "The IPCA cores remained relatively stable, but in high levels.",

        "According to the monthly employment survey of the IBGE, the upward trend in real payroll initiated in January accelerated in June and July.",
        "However, average real earnings grew at a slower pace, reflecting the increase of jobs with relatively lower wages.",
        "Negotiations for wage readjustments in the first half of the year were very favorable to the recovery of labor income.",
        "Even with readjustments equal to past inflation, average real earnings tend to increase if future inflation declines, comparatively to past inflation.",
        "The current perspective is that negotiations in the second half of this year will be highly favorable to the recovery in labor income.",
        "The recovery in real earnings is an important source of sustainability to the expansion of the aggregate demand, and is paramount for the continuation of the economic rebound in a more balanced and disseminated way.",
        "In particular, that latest result reflects a negative performance in the pharmaceutical products sector, which is not attributable to labor income dynamics, as opposed to the positive results of several economic activities strongly dependent on income.",
        "As the industrial production surpasses historical high levels, an important concern to monetary policy is the capacity of the productive sector to accommodate the demand expansion.",
        "According to the FGV, the industry presented relatively low levels of idle capacity in July, and in some sectors, the installed capacity utilization was close to historical peaks.",
        "It is important to notice that, as the idle capacity is reduced, there is a gradual effect over the inflation dynamics, because even when production is beyond the existing limits, the marginal cost increases.",
        "Emergency measures, such as multiple shifts in production, or imports that would not be competitive in normal market conditions, may be able to avoid shortages, but would not mitigate price pressures inherent to a progressively higher level of capacity utilization.",
        "As the initial monetary impulse loses momentum, and the economic recovery process begins to be sustained on its self-propagation mechanisms, it is natural and sound that, at the margin, production and sales growth rates decelerate.",
        "It is even more natural and sound that this deceleration takes place in a situation in which growth rates have been, on average, unusually high, even for initial stages of a cyclical recovery, and the aggregate production level has overcome previous historical highs.",
        "Even though the industry growth rates have declined since May, the latest results still show a rather robust growth rate.",
        "A few recent indicators have been interpreted as evidence that a more pronounced deceleration is progressing in a spontaneous fashion, despite the fact that it is difficult to identify turning points in volatile series, such as the ones regarding the level of economic activity.",
        "The exchange rate appreciation contributed to this result, as nominal exports revenues in Brazilian _Reais decreased.",
        "Inversely, other important coincident indicators still grew in August, as in the case of vehicles and steel production.",
        "In spite of being plausible that some spontaneous accommodation is in fact in course or on the way, there is no data confirming beforehand an accommodation trend intense enough to rule out any concern about a potential gap between supply and demand, as well as about its effects over the inflation dynamics, given the current level of production.",
        "Recent data suggests that fixed capital investment is recovering in an encouraging way.",
        "The historical series of gross fixed capital formation shows, naturally, high degree of correlation with installed capacity utilization and, with some lags, with the sovereign risk.",
        "The performance of these leading indicators confirms that there is room for expansion in fixed capital investment in the next months.",
        "Although investment has been particularly promising since the beginning of the current growth cycle, the pace of output recovery has also been more intense than usual, which gives room to the uncertainties concerning the speed at which the output gap is closing.",
        "Recent data indicate that the growth pace of the U.S. economy has slowed down, while inflation has remained subdued.",
        "As a consequence, a more intense hike in U.S. interest rates has become less likely.",
        "In contrast to the tension in the second quarter of the year, international financial markets have remained calm.",
        "International oil prices, on the other hand, continue to be a source of concern.",
        "Even though the prices have fallen from the historical records of August, oil prices remain high and very much sensitive to any threat to the larger exporters supply capacity.",
        "It is important to emphasize, though, that the existing lag between domestic and international gasoline prices is being temporarily mitigated by a deviation in the international price of gasoline from that of the crude oil.",
        "As mentioned in the August Copoms Minutes, the inflationary risk associated to oil is not only restrained to domestic gasoline prices, but also encompasses other oil intensive products.",
        "Although the deterioration of expectations has been triggered by the exchange rate depreciation of the second quarter and reinforced by the concerns about oil prices, the reversion of this trend will depend not only on the recent exchange rate appreciation and an eventual more favorable scenario for oil prices but also on other developments, such as the domestic demand conditions and the inflation results along the incoming months.",
        "The market scenario projects inflation rates above the ones of the benchmark scenario thus, above the inflation target because it assumes that there will be a slight reduction in the Over-Selic rate in 2005, and some exchange rate depreciation throughout the projection horizon.",
        "Copoms estimates indicate that inflationary inertia would have an impact of 0.9 p.p.",
        "The Copom understands that the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime allows for the inertia not to be fully fought in a single year, as a way to promote a smoother transition to the inflation targets in the medium run.",
        "In particular, the system of adjusted targets allowed for, besides the anticipated decision to partially accommodate the inertia inherited from the previous year, new adjustments throughout the year by the incorporation of the primary effect of certain shocks.",
        "The increased stability of Brazil allows for the monetary conduct to be guided in 2005 by a predetermined objective for inflation, restricted to the central target set by the CMN plus the partial accommodation of the inflationary inertia.",
        "The establishment of such an objective at this moment is due to the fact that the monetary policy has its effects over economic activity and inflation within some lags, and therefore, requires adjustment with the due anticipation to obtain the desired effects.",
        "The fact that the monetary policy will have as an objective an inflation rate that is above the central target even before the beginning of the year suggests that the new shocks that may affect the inflation dynamics should be treated asymmetrically.",
        "The Copom members agreed that, if the current monetary stance were maintained unchanged, the strong economic expansion would not spontaneously accommodate to a pace consistent with the convergence of inflation to its path.",
        "The inflation projections by the Committee confirm the increasing risk that inflation could deviate from its targets.",
        "The underlying inflation trend captured by the several core measures is relatively steady at levels that are inconsistent with the targets.",
        "Additional risks to inflation are the deterioration of market inflation expectations, the very indefinite outlook in the global oil market, and the potential pressure of the increase in wholesale industrial inflation, in an environment that favors the re-composition of profit margins, including the ones stemming from wages readjustments that tend to increase average real earnings.",
        "The Copom members consensually concluded that the best stance was to initiate a process of moderate adjustment in the monetary policy instrument.",
        "Due to the existing time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over the economy, central banks have necessarily to act in a preventive way, before contemporary data attests that inflation is out of control or that there are excessive demand pressures.",
        "In fact, when considering the prospective scenario for the economy throughout a longer period, the monetary stance aims at avoiding that those risks do materialize.",
        "If current data already confirmed an inflation rate out of control or excessive demand pressures, the monetary policy response would have to be different from the one now considered by the Committee.",
        "In this sense, the monetary adjustment main and final objective is to provide conditions for the long run sustainable growth.",
        "Another consensual agreement was the evaluation that the adjustment should come in a gradual way, differently from the shock treatment recommended to crisis episodes faced by Brazil in the past.",
        "Five members of the Copom concluded that a 0.25 percentage point increase in the OverSelic rate would be adequate to initiate the adjustment process, making it as smooth as possible, and minimizing the initial turbulence risks.",
        "The other three members voted for an increase of 0.5 p.p., which, according to their evaluation, would better signal the magnitude of the overall adjustment required to bring inflation back to the targets path, and would better correspond to the optimal speed of implementation of this adjustment process.",
        "The regional distribution of growth was generalized, encompassing all States in the country, except for Roraima.",
        "All groups encompassing the retail sector posted year-on-year growth rates in June, more noticeably in the sector of furniture and electrical appliances, which grew in a much higher pace than the aggregate retail group.",
        "Regarding fixed capital investment, the indicators show deceleration in July, without characterizing, though, change in the expansion trend.",
        "Out of the 23 activities surveyed, 16 registered increases in output, while out of the 4 categories, 2 expanded.",
        "External Environment Recent indicators suggest that world economic growth is building up in the third quarter, after some deceleration in the previous quarter.",
        "In the U.S., wholesale sales, civil construction expenditure and capacity utilization grew month-on-month in July.",
        "In August, industrial output grew and unemployment rate declined, while retail sales fell.",
        "In Germany, industrial output and manufacturing orders increased in July, after decreases in the previous month.",
        "In Japan, industrial capital goods expenditure increased in the second quarter, while in China, despite the growth deceleration measures, industrial output grew again in August.",
        "Regarding foreign trade, there are signs of significant growth.",
        "On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, the deficit in goods and services increased in the same month.",
        "Regarding business expectations, there was generalized slowdown in the main economies in August.",
        "However, in the U.S., expectations are favorable, reflecting the economic momentum.",
        "Consumer prices indicators decreased in the main economies in July, alleviating the risks of inflation acceleration.",
        "Wholesale prices in the U.S. decreased in August, as a consequence of the slowdown in the prices of oil, food and vehicles.",
        "On the other hand, in China, wholesale inflation increased in August.",
        "In the international financial markets, the volatility reduced and assets appreciated.",
        "Regarding the commodity markets, there was slight retraction in the prices of food products, and a new increase in metal prices.",
        "Oil prices have fallen in the last weeks, but the market has remained volatile and lacking a clear trend, still representing a risk to price stability and to the global economic growth.",
        "The determinant factor underlying the yield curve move was the markets interpretation of the August Copoms Minutes.",
        "From August 18 to September 15, the spread on the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year rates in relation to the Over-Selic rate increased by 0.47 p.p., by 0.28 p.p.",
        "and by 0.17 p.p., respectively, while the 2-year and the 3year rates decreased by 0.01 p.p.",

        "The BCB also carried out in this period 15 fixed rate overnight repos, fourteen of which with a one-working-day tenure and one with a three-working-day tenure.",
        "The frequent overnight operations have enabled the reduction of the gap between the Over-Selic rate and its target, from 0.13 p.p.",
        "This reversal reflected the supply increase due to the harvest period.",
        "Among other pressures, electricity prices, pasteurized milk, clothes and bottled cooking gas were the main contributors for the IPCA change.",
        "In contrast, among items with price decreases, the most important ones were meat, gasoline, fuel alcohol and rice.",
        "Concerning regulated prices, the most significant contribution came from the rise of electricity prices in six state capitals and urban buses fares in Curitiba and Porto Alegre, besides the increase of bottled cooking gas prices.",
        "These increases prevailed over the negative variations in the prices of fuel alcohol and gasoline, though in lower magnitude than the contribution registered in March.",
        "Increasing commodity prices were the main cause of pressure on industrial wholesale prices.",
        "Fuel, sugar, medicine and agricultural machinery presented the highest price changes.",
        "All measures of IPCA core inflation declined in April.",
        "In May, consumer inflation should still be affected by medicine, health insurance and clothes prices, as well as by the adjustment in electricity prices in various state capitals and the recovery of fuel alcohol prices.",
        "Moreover, an unexpected turnaround in the downward trend of food prices has been noticed in the first weeks of the month, as shown in the partial IPC-S and IPC-Fipe results.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information.",
        "This figure is endogenously determined, taking into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change; e.\nHowever, general price indices have recorded higher rates.",
        "Industrial wholesale inflation has continued to increase, though the pass-through to consumer inflation has remained lower than usual.",
        "Core consumer inflation in April also declined compared to March.",
        "Certainly, the Aprils IPCA result does not imply that inflation is accommodating at a lower level.",
        "Still, it is an evidence of the seasonal relief that had already been incorporated to the Copoms forecasting exercises.",
        "The IPCA behavior has been consistent with the Copoms assessment and projections, under a hypothesis of low inflation persistence in the first quarter of the year.",
        "Economic activity has sustained the recovery trend since the second half of 2003, as confirmed by several indicators.",
        "According to the industrial survey, all regions showed a positive performance, except Rio de Janeiro.",
        "The improvement in activity can also be depicted from the Fecomercio-SP consumer sentiment survey.",
        "Consumer confidence improved in May to a level similar to January and February the highest since the survey began, in March Labor market indicators, which usually react with a lag in recovery cycles, have also improved.",
        "In the first four months of 2004, 535 thousand jobs were created, the best performance since For comparison, during last year 645 thousand jobs were created.",
        "It is important to notice that the activity rebound continued during the first quarter of 2004, despite the widespread apprehension that the Copoms decision to keep unchanged the Over-Selic rate in January and February could have halted the process.",
        "Such concerns were probably enhanced by the negative industrial output figures for January and February.",
        "However, variables directly linked to demand, such as retail and industrial sales, together with industrial output for March, confirmed that the recovery process had not lost momentum.",
        "Several indicators released since then have indicated that the expectational effects of the Copom decision in January and February, as anticipated by the Committee, were successful in influencing the inflation dynamics in the shortrun, without damaging the cyclical rebound that was already spread out.",
        "Brazilian external accounts have continued posting expressive positive results.",
        "First quarter data indicate that exports growth is mainly a result of higher quantities.",
        "Although some reallocation of investment portfolios had already been anticipated, the move was more abrupt than expected.",
        "The short-term instability impacted several currencies, as well as emerging markets risk premiums.",
        "However, this greater instability does not characterize a crisis, due to both its temporary nature and the sound fundaments of the Brazilian economy.",
        "Brazil is in a much better situation to react to external events than it was in the past, given the substantial fiscal and external adjustments it has achieved.",
        "The Brazilian government has been giving solid proof of fiscal responsibility, as noted in the recent decision about the minimum wage readjustment.",
        "Moreover, economic activity indicators, including the ones referring to the labor market, have been providing unquestionable evidence of the Brazilian sustained economic recovery, diminishing concerns that have fuelled volatility in the last weeks.",
        "If this trend results from higher demand perspectives, and not from exogenous supply constraints, it will find natural limits in its own effects over the world economic growth.",
        "Given the recent record levels, the most likely scenario for the next months is some accommodation in prices.",
        "The Copom has been explicitly including in its projections an increase in domestic gasoline prices.",
        "If oil prices remain high in the medium-term, characterizing a supply shock of a more permanent fashion, it will be necessary to revaluate this projection and its likely primary and secondary inflationary impacts.",
        "In addition to the increase in oil prices and to the uncertainty related to the US monetary stance, there has been a certain concern regarding the possibility of a slowdown in China, a country responsible for a significant share of Brazilian exports growth.",
        "There are also indirect effects, due to the reduction of Brazilian exports prices.",
        "Thus, there are reasons to believe that the Brazilian exports performance wont be strongly affected by a possible reduction in the pace of the Chinese economic growth.",
        "Market inflation expectations increased, reflecting an environment of greater uncertainty.",
        "However, the increase was small and expectations remained properly anchored.",
        "As in previous meetings, the Copom examined chiefly the inflation outlook under the hypothesis of a low degree of persistence of the first quarter inflation.",
        "This hypothesis is based on a seasonal relief in market prices inflation in the second and third quarters, as observed in previous years.",
        "For 2005, the market scenario projects higher inflation than the benchmark one, because the former supposes a declining interest rate path and a slightly depreciated exchange rate.",
        "The significant adjustment of the current account, the reduction of the FX-linked debt, the adjustment of the consolidated public sector accounts, the combination of floating exchange rate with inflation targeting, the economic activity rebound in the last quarters and the credibility gains in macroeconomic management help to absorb the consequences of the external shock.",
        "Even in less favorable scenarios than the most likely ones analyzed by the Copom, it is possible to be optimistic about economic growth with price stability prospects in the medium-term.",
        "In an inflation targeting regime, the Central Bank policy-making is based on the assessment of different scenarios for the most important variables affecting inflation dynamics.",
        "The uncertainties about the external scenario have been responsible for a short-term volatility that increased the uncertainty about future inflation behavior.",
        "As a consequence, both the assessment of alternative scenarios by the monetary authority and the coordination of private agent's expectations become more difficult.",
        "In this environment, the volatility triggered by risk factors that should not prevail in the medium-term, when the external scenario will be cleared, could affect inflation expectations for a longer period.",
        "Three members of the Copom considered relatively low the risk of a contagion of inflation expectations by the short-term volatility and voted for a decrease of 25 basis points in the OverSelic rate.",
        "However, six members considered that this risk could increase substantially if the monetary policy did not take into account the even remote possibility that some changes in the external scenario might be permanent.",
        "Therefore, these six members understood that the most adequate decision would be to keep the Over-Selic rate unchanged.",
        "The production and sales data for March 2004 should be carefully analyzed, as the carnival holiday in 2004 was in February.",
        "This effect has different impacts among the sectors and can distort the monthly and annual comparisons of production and sales.",
        "Such distortions are not completely eliminated by usual seasonally adjusted methods.",
        "This result was better than the ones released by regional Trade Federations.",
        "However, it is important to notice that the methodology and the geographic coverage of these surveys are rather distinct.",
        "The Fecomercio-SP survey pointed to a recovery of consumer confidence in May, after three consecutive monthly falls.",
        "This result reflected, mostly, the improvement in expectations of consumers with earnings up to ten minimum wages, while consumers with higher earnings were more cautious in assessing the current and future economic scenario.",
        "This increase was widespread, encompassing eighteen out of the twentythree activities, and three out of the four use categories.",
        "Considering the quarterly moving average, output remained unchanged from February to March, after a decline at the beginning of the year.",
        "According to the FGV survey, business sentiment improved in regard to both demand and employment, considering a 3-month horizon.",
        "In the first four months of the year, 535 thousand jobs were created, the highest number ever registered for this period of the year.",
        "The result was due to declines of 0.5 p.p.",
        "Non-performing credit to companies increased 0.1 p.p.",
        "In Germany, GDP growth presented the highest figure since the first quarter of 2001, boosted by exports.",
        "In the U.S., labor market data showed new jobs creation, reduction of the unemployment rate and fall of unemployment claims.",
        "Other economic indicators point to the sustainability of GDP growth, such as the expansion of industrial orders, industrial production, installed capacity and productivity.",
        "In the U.S., business sentiment in the services sector improved in April, while those from the industrial sector remained stable.",
        "In Europe, business sentiment also improved.",
        "In Japan, the Shoko Chukin index, for small and medium corporations, remained above the optimistic level, in spite of having slowed down in April.",
        "Consumer sentiment improved in the US and Japan, and remained stable in Europe.",
        "The Bank of England raised the repo rate by 25 basis points on May In the US, inflationary pressures were moderate in April, in spite of the vigorous economic growth.",
        "In China, consumer inflation rose again in April, increasing the concern of monetary authorities with respect to the inflation effects of the significant economic growth.",
        "Global markets suffered with high volatility in the past weeks, anticipating the effects of the expected increase in the US interest rates and the measures adopted by the Chinese government to decelerate economic growth.",
        "US Treasuries yields increased, a trend followed by the Treasuries of Japan and Europe.",
        "Emerging markets bonds fell, with generalized increases in country risk indicators, currency depreciations against the US dollar and sharp falls in stock exchanges indices.",
        "In the FX market, the US dollar appreciated against other hard currencies, in spite of high US fiscal and trade deficits.",
        "Apart from oil, commodity prices fell after peaking in March, even though current levels are still well above the historical averages.",
        "Oil prices, on the contrary, increased in the past weeks, mainly as a result of political tensions in the Middle East, of heated world demand, and of the fact that refineries are operating close to capacity in a period of high seasonal consumption of gasoline in the US.",
        "The market perception of a tighter U.S. monetary policy triggered a movement of portfolio reallocations, affecting emerging markets' assets and, particularly, Brazils assets.",
        "Domestic interest rates rose significantly in the period, and the futures yield curve reverted the downward slope that had been observed since April From April 14 to May 19, the 3-month, 1-year and 2-year rates increased to 0.09 p.p.",
        "from 0.46 p.p., to 2.23 p.p.",
        "from 0.68 p.p., and to 3.67 p.p.",
        "from 0.17 p.p., respectively.",
        "The BCB did not carry out auctions to rollover securities and Fx swaps maturing in the period.",
        "No bidding was accepted on the auction of May 4, and the auctions scheduled for the coming two weeks were canceled, given market volatility.",
        "The BCB maintained in its open market operations the weekly post-fixed repo operations, with tenure of two weeks, the fixed operations, with tenure of three months, as well as the 2-workingday liquidity management operations.",
        "The BCB also carried out in this period 7 fixed rate repos falling due between 1 and 2 working days.",
        "Inflation should accelerate further in November, as a consequence of, among other factors, the second installment of the readjustment in fixed-line telephone services determined by the Supreme Judicial Court and the increases in fuel-alcohol prices and urban bus tariffs in Belo Horizonte.",
        "The favorable contribution of fresh food prices to inflation may be smaller in November than in October.",
        "Assessment of Inflation Trends The inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information.",
        "This acceleration occurred despite the fall in food prices for the second consecutive month.",
        "Regulated prices were pressured by fuel prices, especially fuel-alcohol.",
        "The acceleration of the industrial-IPA practically offset the fall of the agriculture-IPA.",
        "The Copom will continue to monitor the potential transmission of wholesale inflation to consumer inflation in the coming months.",
        "The intensity of the pass-through will basically depend on future demand conditions and on the market inflation expectations.",
        "According to the three methodologies used by the Copom, IPCA core inflation increased in October.",
        "The upsurge was more significant for the core excluding food and regulated prices and for the core under the non-smoothed trimmed mean, which had decelerated in September.",
        "As stressed in the October Copom minutes, the September core results did not reflect the reversion in the underlying inflation trend but the persisting volatility in these measures.",
        "Therefore, the cores have persisted in levels incompatible with the inflation targets.",
        "However, this specific outcome does not indicate that industrial output is reverting the growth trend, as isolated positive performances do not indisputably indicate acceleration in the growth rhythm.",
        "After the uninterrupted growth from March to August, some accommodation is expected because industrial activity is volatile, with short-term oscillations around the growth trend.",
        "Methods aimed at diminishing this volatility, such as the three-month moving average of the seasonally adjusted series, show a continuous output expansion since February, although at lower positive rates in recent months.",
        "In addition to converging to a more moderate growth pace, growth dynamics have continued to disseminate.",
        "In the recent past, the relative importance of the industries more sensitive to income has increased, disregard of the activities more sensitive to credit, which leaded the initial stages of the recovery process.",
        "The activity rebound in the last five quarters has continued to positively affect the labor market.",
        "Furniture and electrical appliances, and vehicles and motorcycles continued to lead the retail expansion, supported by credit conditions.",
        "However, similarly to what has happened to industry, less credit-sensitive segments, such as clothing, and super and hypermarkets, have gained momentum.",
        "Considering the activity expansion since the second half of 2003, a critical concern of the Copom is the performance of aggregate supply.",
        "Final consumer goods and intermediate goods, which had already been at high capacity levels, experienced additional increases, while capital goods slightly decreased.",
        "Among industrial sectors, mechanics, electrical and communications materials and food products not only increased capacity utilization levels throughout the year, but also reached historical highs.",
        "In contrast, CNI monthly data indicated a slight decrease in capacity utilization in September, in seasonally adjusted terms, after having peaked in August.",
        "As stressed in past Copom minutes, fixed capital investment is highly correlated with capacity utilization and, notwithstanding the longer lag, with the sovereign risk.",
        "However, the sustainability of this benign scenario will depend on new data regarding the performance of the OECD economies, especially the US, and the evolution of international crude oil prices.",
        "International capital markets expect the Federal Reserve to continue the gradual tightening, although recent activity and inflation data are inconclusive about the current economic trend and, as a consequence, the future monetary stance.",
        "After historical records in October, crude oil prices have fallen.",
        "Expectations about oil prices, currently centered on the magnitude and continuity of the recent decrease in prices, remain uncertain.",
        "Nevertheless, this trend validates the Copom forecasting scenario, where high oil prices were treated more as a latent risk and not as a baseline hypothesis.",
        "For 2005, the Committee has continued to work with aggregate projections for regulated prices, generated by an endogenous determination model.",
        "A preliminary disaggregate analysis confirms, in general terms, the models aggregate projection, assuming domestic gasoline prices maintain their historical correlation with international oil prices.",
        "For 2005, the inflation projections in both the benchmark and the market scenarios have decreased, compared to the Octobers estimates.",
        "These factors have not yet been able to substantially alter the future inflation prospects, despite the recent change in the monetary stance.",
        "For this reason, the Copom decided to maintain the rise of the Over-Selic rate, as to ensure the convergence of the inflation rate to the targets path.",
        "This adjustment in the Over-Selic rate will prevent more drastic adjustments in the future, in order to disinflate the economy, which could seriously damage the growth cycle.",
        "Furthermore, the sustainability of the economic rebound initiated in 2003 depends on the convergence of inflation to the target path, supporting the components of domestic demand more dependent on labor income.",
        "In other words, the monetary policy adjustment process aims at reducing output volatility and at providing long-term sustainability to economic growth.",
        "As mentioned in the October Copom Minutes, the Committee emphasizes that the maintenance of the monetary adjustment in the magnitude and in the pace initially designed, requires that the risk factors do not exacerbate.",
        "Among other aspects, it is important for the recent scenario of international oil prices not to deteriorate and for the rigidity of inflation expectations to reverse.",
        "If the Copom assesses an enhanced risk of inflation deviating from the target path, it will be prepared to alter the pace and the magnitude of the monetary adjustment process initiated in September.",
        "Construction indicators were stable in September, after six consecutive months of expansion.",
        "Industrial output, measured by the IBGE, remained stable in September, in seasonally adjusted terms, after growing from March to August.",
        "Among the use categories, semi and nondurable goods led the performance of industry.",
        "Despite the October negative performance, those leading indicators have grown notably in the year, reaching record highs.",
        "Job creation was led by manufacturing, followed by construction and services.",
        "Data have also continued to indicate that employment has increased at a higher pace outside large metropolitan areas.",
        "The fall in the unemployment rate reflected the effects of the activity rebound on the labor market.",
        "Since then, oil prices have declined, posing less risks to global economic growth.",
        "The stock exchanges reacted favorably to the fall in oil prices.",
        "In mid-June, the volatility of the 2- and 10-year treasuries diminished, as it became more clear the Federal Reserve strategy of gradual tightening.",
        "Since then, Treasury yields have been driven by new economic indicators and geopolitical developments in Iraq.",
        "The purchase of U.S. securities by Asian central banks has helped to smooth the movements in the yield curve.",
        "The third quarter GDP data confirmed the U.S. economic expansion.",
        "Besides the increase in volumes, important export products, such as steel products, oil, gasoline, pork, coffee, sugar, cotton and tobacco have registered price increases.",
        "The longer end of the yield curve was influenced by the fall of oil prices, the decline in country risk, the BRL appreciation, operations in the derivatives market and expectations that monetary policy will enable a quicker convergence of the inflation rate to the target path.",
        "Between October 20 and November 17, the 1-month, 6-month and 1-year interest rates increased by 0.71 p.p., 0.49 p.p.",
        "and 0.20 p.p., respectively, while the 2-year and the 3-year rates decreased by 0.12 p.p.",
        "The BCB also carried out 17 repos in the period, fifteen of which were overnight borrowings, one with a two-working-day tenure and another with an overnight lending."
