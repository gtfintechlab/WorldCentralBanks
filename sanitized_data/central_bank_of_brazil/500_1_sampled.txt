Signs of additional stimulus by monetary authorities of some developed economies contributed to stabilize financial markets and to create a relatively benign environment for emerging economies in the short term
Regarding credit to individuals, an increase in concessions is expected, boosted by the retreat in delinquency and in the household banking debt service, in the case of consumer credit; and by the competition, in the case of the housing segment
The Committee then started debating the future signaling of the conduct of monetary policy
The emerging economies, although yet in a recovery cycle after the 1997 crisis and 1998, tend to suffer the impacts of a loss of dynamism in world trade and of the higher risk aversion of investors, associated with a larger degree of world uncertainty
Furthermore, the war in Ukraine impacts the supply of natural gas, thus bringing additional uncertainty to the European economic scenario, whereas, in China, the deterioration of the real estate sector, coupled with the policy to fight Covid-19, negatively impact the countrys growth prospects
The index behavior reflected, with greater intensity, lower optimism regarding the coming months
The Committee maintained the expectation of a recovery in activity in the second half of the year, although less intense and more concentrated in the services sector
However, in some emerging countries, exchange-rate depreciation prevents further price reductions and limits the actions of their central banks
On the other hand, in economies where inflation rates are at high levels relative to their respective targets, the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more limited
The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, on the benchmark scenario, based on the 360day swap rates estimates a 173 bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 106 bps in the last quarter of The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information
International evidence, ratified by the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk premium, both for private and public funding, and to the shortening of planning horizons, both for households and corporate
Wholesale prices in the U.S. decreased in August, as a consequence of the slowdown in the prices of oil, food and vehicles
In the month, there was no spot intervention in the domestic exchange market
The net public sector debt closed at R 527.2 billion in the month of March, corresponding to 47 of GDP
Regarding monetary policy, mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances and, in specific cases, non-conventional monetary policy initiatives
As in the previous month, the BCB decided not to rollover the FX debt and swaps maturing on February 11th
The Copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables
Copoms position is that the current real rate of interest is not neutral or, in other words, it is above the real long-term equilibrium rate for the Brazilian economy
Regarding wholesale inflation, a deceleration is also expected as anticipated by the results of the IGP-10 and the first ten-day period of the IGP-M, notwithstanding the continuity of specific adjustments due to increases in international commodity prices
Inversely, other important coincident indicators still grew in August, as in the case of vehicles and steel production
Similarly, the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in April, with the positive result of 50.3 thousand jobs
If those shocks prove to be more persistent or larger than anticipated, the Committee will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening cycle
The residential properties prices continue increasing, which, combined with the high prices of the stocks, has resulted in an increase in household wealth
Other Copom members argued that the evolution of some inflation components that are more sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary policy continue to indicate a pause, at the margin
It also bears emphasizing that, in a given period, the fiscal impulse is equivalent to the change of the structural surplus compared to the observed in the previous period
Despite the reduction of systemic risk perception, since mid-March, such difficulties could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in the quality of credit, which would reinforce the already evident trend to financial contraction, increasing the risk of slowdown intensification
However, it bears highlighting oil prices volatility, a result of low predictability of some global demand components, of dependency of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and of geopolitical complexity that is typical to the sector
The evolution of wholesale price indices, on the other hand, basically reflected the passthrough of the exchange rate
The short-term rates increased influenced by the disclosure of activity data suggesting consistent recovery of the Brazilian economy and expectations of inflation above the targeted path
The overall average tenure on credit operations reached 94 months in July, representing increases of 0.4 month, month-on-month, and 13.8 months, year-over-year
For semi- and non-durable consumer goods, the seasonally adjusted quarterly moving average series have posted the highest output level since August 2003, when these sectors resumed growth
The Committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of international commodities prices
The Committee noticed a persistent dynamism in the labor market, with real wage gains in recent months
The Copom understands that the maintenance of monetary stability is a necessary condition so that the relative prices system continues to signal efficiently the adjustments requested for ongoing consumption and production patterns in the economy
These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets
The strategy of rolling exchange securities as they mature continued in the period under analysis
Even though inflation is under control, there are growing uncertainties with respect to how long this trend will continue, despite high productivity gains
Inflation has remained at moderate levels in the US and in the Euro Zone, and in Japan, deflation is still recorded
There has been an adjustment in the extent and speed of the monetary policy tightening cycle in some advanced countries, which has led to a further tightening of financial conditions
Prices In August, the adjustment of the administered prices continued to exert pressure on the main inflation indices, albeit at a lower intensity, thus contributing to lower monthly changes as compared to July
The BCB maintained in its open market operations the 3-month fixed and the 2-week indexed repurchase operations, as well as the daily liquidity management operations, with tenor of two working days
The inflation high was caused by depreciation of the euro and increases in international petroleum prices
In the seasonally adjusted statistical series, production and imports of capital goods expanded by 2.3 and 14 in January, respectively, as against 2.7 and -11.3 in the preceding month
Following the July and August supply shocks when inflation neared three percentage points in the two month period, the September and October results point to a rapid downturn and an accumulated rate of just 0.4 percentage points in the period
Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration
Based on new information, the Committee judges that those conditions no longer hold, as inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are sufficiently close to the inflation target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy
NBCE were offered on three occasions for purposes of rolling maturing exchange securities
In short, the set of available data indicates a heated labor market, although with some signs of moderation at the margin
Investment expansion and imports growth have contributed to retard this process, limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained growth
They evaluated that, despite the partial reduction in governmental emergency transfer programs, the economic recovery has been better than expected
Some industrial categories which manufacture intermediate goods are operating close to their full installed capacity
Oil prices, a systematic source of international uncertainty, not only remained at historically high levels but also continued highly volatile
The lower growth rate of the PEA in the recent past has contributed to stability, at low levels, of the unemployment rates, despite the moderation in the pace of job creation
In contrast, the central bank of Indonesia increased its basic interest rate
Disbursements to the manufacturing sector expanded by 4.7 in the year and 10.5 in the 12-month period ended in the month of March
They assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable levels, and that inflation projections indicate a convergence of inflation to target over the course of 2019 and This path is consistent with inflation expectations, which remain anchored
Out of the ten sectors surveyed, eight sectors performed positively month-on-month in November
Defaults in the private financial system closed December at 4.3 and have declined steadily from a May level of 5.4
The existence of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors suggests that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion can be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions, added up to imports penetration increase
Regarding regulated prices, the negative change was due to the reduction of fuel prices, which prevailed over the increases of water and sewage tariffs and bottled gas prices
In Japan, the Tankan indicator increased for the fifth consecutive month, registering a record high since In Europe, business confidence remained flat, although consumer confidence increased
However, the Brazilian economy remains sound and shows greater resilience to face the international markets turmoil
For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity
The US economic activity, for instance, has shown signs of stabilization in household consumption and in the housing market
Recent indicators show a worse composition
The recent behavior of international petroleum prices, despite the production cuts announced by OPEC, suggests a weakening of the upward price trend started two years ago
The Committee evaluates that the global inflationary scenario is still challenging
In emerging economies, in general, monetary policy bias is expansionist
including those of fiscal nature, presents itself as both a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing room for the beginning of a process of gradual and disinflationary process
Since inflation remains relatively high, it is still premature to conclude that inflation persistence is definitively decreasing and that the effect of the exchange rate appreciation on prices is significant
Parallel to this, since fuel increases occurred in the second half of July, part of the impact will still be felt in terms of August inflation
In this context, the assessment of purchase managers, expressed by the global PMI, fell for the fourth consecutive month, reaching 50.3 points in June, the lowest level of the last three years
These considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate demand, the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative prices, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the last months of 2008 and in The Copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive capacity
The most recent data indicate that although investment has been contributing to soften the trend of increasing capacity utilization rates, it has not been sufficient to stop this process
Some members of the Committee emphasized that there was an increase in longer-term expectations in much of the emerging countries, reflecting the magnitude and persistence of the global shocks still underway
High unemployment rates in Europe, coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties, are translated into investments decline and low growth
In line with the positive developments in labor market, and with the expansion of credit, retail sales continue to record positive performance
For those members, the resilience of activity and the strength of the labor market suggest lower elasticity of the output gap to the monetary policy, which could lead to an even slower disinflation process
Recent changes in relative prices, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation targets, without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken place
Unemployment held steady at 4.0
The Committee believes that the disinflation dynamics is still characterized by a process with two distinct stages
In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating considerably, inflationary pressures have reduced fast
The PMI indicator for the industrial sector indicates contraction of the Brazilian production in April
However, the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain fragile, with uncertainty regarding growth and deflationary risks in major developed economies
LFT placements with a total value of R 13.5 billion were held on four different occasions, while redemptions added up to R 18.5 billion
For the Committee, supported on positive data recently released, the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have remained
The combination of such that the economy continued to show signs of factors recommended waiting until the next Regarding the global outlook, the Committee path for regulated prices and its effects on the members pointed out the risks associated with the prospective scenario for inflation
Money Market and Open Market Operations Over the past weeks, there has been high volatility in the yield curves
The manufacturing industry showed positive balance of 74.6 thousand jobs, the seventh consecutive month of expansion and the best result of the series for the month
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations decreased in October, reaching 456 days, down from 458 days in September
The labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin
The Committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and transfers, with negative repercussions over households confidence and consumption
On its turn, the Japanese economy cannot overcome deflation and recovers at a slow pace, led by exports
Retail sales sustained positive, though decreasing, rates when compared to those of the same period of the previous year
At this stage, however, it is particularly difficult to project the output gap, in an environment of a sharp expansion of demand, as has been observed in the last few quarters
The Committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment
Notwithstanding this risk, the Copom members considered that the The Copom assessed that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks on both sides
High unemployment rates for a long period, coupled with the implementation of fiscal adjustments, the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature economies
The risks are likely to persist as long as a tight labor market is observed in several advanced economies
Despite the dominant opinion still seems to point out to a transitory, but possibly intense deceleration, the negative assessments have become more disseminated
Tradable prices contributed with 0.12 p.p., mainly due to increases in the prices of sugar and new and second-hand cars
In general, the recent evolution of these indices signals reduction of the pressures stemming from wholesale prices over consumer prices
The effects of these stimuli, however, are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial crisis, by those referring to the significant worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the monetary policy stance change
In March, inflation measured by the main price indices will continue to fall although it will remain at high levels compared to the average for this month in previous years
GDP growth was adjusted according to recent data released by IBGE
The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process
The Committee considers that, in part, such regulatory changes should materialize as an element of aggregate demand constraint through the credit channel, as well as by the reduction of incentives to the adoption of strategies such as the simple broadening of contract tenures, among others
This has so far relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy
However, during periods of disinflation, nominal interest rates are expected to fall gradually, and therefore forecasts for relatively long time horizons based on constant nominal interest rates tend to overestimate the downward trajectory of inflation
Risks around the global scenario have increased
In December, the manufacturing PMI grew to 55.2, the highest value since July 2006, when it had recorded 55.In China, economic activity remains sound, with exports growing in a steady way, boosted by the high in the sales destined the to Euro Zone
Due to the intrinsic uncertainty and the very nature of this variable, the Committee reinforced that the neutral rate is not a variable to be updated at a high frequency and that it is not expected to register abrupt movements either, except in exceptional cases
With respect to the labor market, data indicate a trend toward recovery with no significant pressure on costs
The Copom also thinks that the persistence of a significant mismatch between the growth paces of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary dynamics, but evaluates that the expected trajectories of domestic consumption and investment have become more uncertain
Investment indicators have expanded in recent months, particularly under capital goods output
This importance tends to broaden as the recovery of employment and real payroll lead to higher consumption
On this subject, some members evaluated the possibility of incorporating some increase in the neutral interest rate, towards the movement observed in longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey
In the first two, these papers were negotiated with terms of four years, while the third offer was placed with a five year term
The IBGE released data for Q1 2009 GDP
Industrial output was 8.4 higher than in February 1999, while new housing starts expanded by 2.4, utilizing the same basis of comparison
Further increases of fuel-alcohol prices, the readjustment of gasoline prices announced on November 26, and the urban bus fare increases in Recife and Belo Horizonte should be emphasized
In short, evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing the last months, showing a reduction in the idle margin of the industry, accompanied by the resume of investments
Out of this total, there was the creation of 61.5 11 thousand jobs in the services sector, 42.2 thousand jobs in civil construction, 37.5 thousand jobs in manufacturing industry and 12.3 thousand jobs in the agricultural and livestock sector; while 36.3 thousand jobs in commerce were eliminated
On the other hand, the Copom highlights that the significant monetary policy easing process that has been implemented since January, will have cumulative effects over the economy and will be evidenced after some time lag
The Committee believes that the best contribution of monetary policy continues to be in combating inflationary pressures and smoothing out economic fluctuations
The production of agricultural equipment in the last few years has improved with the continuous expansion in grain crops, as well as other agricultural products, a _Information for unrestricted disclosure
Regarding the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a faster pace, with data confirming the acceleration of a process of distension in this market
Despite the restrictive monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that the cycle of monetary easing is already being transmitted to the credit market
Regarding metal commodities, we highlight the advance in the price of tin and decline in the price of iron ore
In the first quarter, foreign sales expanded by 1.7 and imports by 10.9 in relation to the same period of 1999,  as the foreign trade sector has shown increasingly clearer signs of improvement since February
Consumer price indices will come under some upward pressure from the prices of rice, milk and dairy products and clothing prices
CNI indicators showed smooth recovery of industrial activity in May
However, for the Committee, after a necessary period of adjustments, which has been more intense and longer than anticipated, as companies and households confidence strengthen, the activity pace tends to intensify
The BCB also conducted very short-term operations, in 27 opportunities as a borrower and 5 as a lender of resources, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days
The Committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depend on the strengthening of companies and households confidence
It was noted that, if these movements are persistent, the resulting inflationary impacts may be significant and will be duly incorporated by the Committee
In the period extending from May 24 to June 19, the monetary impact of definitive operations with Banco Central securities was contraction of R 0.9 billion, while operations for which the National Treasury is liable had an expansionary impact of R 1.9 billion
In short, recent data indicate that, although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization rates, the maturation of investment projects has not been sufficient, until now, to significantly limit existing mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand
In the same period, the BCB conducted 29 borrowing overnight repo operations
The prices of some commodities and Brazilian assets remained relatively stable and, overall, prospects for external funding for the Brazilian economy remain favorable
In short, available information suggests some persistence of inflation, which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector and, in the short run, the realignment process of regulated prices
All Committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable way
The dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial conditions, favored, among other factors, by the policies of official banks
Once the central scenario had been presented, simulations were made of the different economic models based on alternative scenarios
Therefore, the strategy adopted by the Copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in 2010 and in the next years, which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly corrected
In fact, pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging economies, many of which are in the midst of monetary tightening cycles
For the prospective scenario, Copom discussed more thoroughly the determinants of services inflation
This intensification of the disinflation process relies on an adequate global environment
In the beginning of December, the Central Bank resumed the purchase of foreign currency
Hence, the Committee concluded that possible new interest rates reductions would demand The Copom members debated on the level of caution and additional gradualism
In emerging economies from Southeast Asia, that are more dependent upon exports, local central banks have performed cuts in their policy rates in an attempt to mitigate the impact that the negative expectations about the worldwide economy have over their local industrial production
The options to raise the base interest rates by 0.25 p.p
Although fiscal and monetary stimuli have limited the risks of a deeper activity contraction, the dominant expectation still indicates a more consistent recovery only from 2009 on
The reason underlying this conclusion is that improvement in the climate of confidence in the economy also encourages greater participation of the labor force
The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus, but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small
The shocks identified are practically the same as those delineated at the previous Copom meeting
In this context, the reduction of inflationary pressures continues to require the commitment and determination of central banks with the control of inflation through a more prolonged tightening of financial conditions
There are solid evidence of a smaller inflation inertia in the Brazilian economy in recent years
Nuci also grew 1.4 p.p
Thus, in the case of a negative shock, action should be taken to let the deviation from target be only temporary
In this environment, there have been signs of reduction in risk aversion, but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to reversals
On the other hand, capacity utilization in the intermediate goods industry remained flat in the period, in the range between the average and the historical peak, an interval much narrower than in other sectors
Overall, the Committee assessed that the updated activity projections are in fact stronger for the year
GDP may close the first quarter of 2003 roughly stable in comparison to the previous quarter
For housing credits, despite the demand at levels higher than those observed from July to September 2012, the expected approval of new lines tends to be similar to the previous quarter
In this environment, there are signs, albeit incipient, of reduction in risk aversion, but the return of confidence remains fragile, due to the susceptibility of the markets to the flow of economic and non-economic news
Reflecting the cooling of the domestic industrial growth, imports of raw material _Information for unrestricted disclosure
In the short run, inflation should reflect significant temporary upward pressures stemming from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price changes
For fuels and lubricant, the import reduction, due to the contraction in economic growth, might be mitigated by the necessity to substitute electric energy for energy generated from oil by products
The Committee will monitor the different measures of exchange-rate pass-through to both inflation and underlying inflation
Regarding the external component of aggregate demand, the scenario of greater global growth, combined with the depreciation of the BRL, contributes to make this component more favorable to the Brazilian economy growth
The main risks continue to relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy
The Copom reaffirms that, in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process underway, the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and GDP growth rates continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential
In the that the approval and implementation of reforms end, the understanding prevailed that the focus on notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the best possible decision, given the set of the Brazilian economy are fundamental for the information available at the time, results, over time, sustainability of the environment of low and stable in greater credibility for monetary policy
In relation to February, industrial production fell by 1 and the pace of annual growth declined to 4.7, as against 8.4 in the previous month
Finally, pressures persist in volatile components such as food and fuel prices and especially electricity fares, due to factors including the exchange rate, commodity prices, and adverse weather conditions
In other words, neither of these scenario for the sensitivity of services inflation to factors is a necessary nor sufficient condition for an the economic activity
Moreover, formal jobs creation remains at strong levels and there is still a high proportion of voluntary layoffs
Among the factors underpinning this movement, it bears highlighting the disclosure of still more pressured current inflation indices, including the various core measures, the maintenance of inflation projections at high levels and expectations of agents regarding the start of the 12 monetary tightening cycle by the Central Bank
Regarding the global economy, the data already Short-term inflation seems to be cooling after Julys available for the 2020Q2 GDP did not surprise, but it sharp increase
Viewed over a twelve-month horizon, growth in the general price index - 10 IGP-10, general price index - market IGP-M and general price index - domestic supply IGP-DI closed at February levels of 18.03, 16.78 and 14.96, respectively, as compared to December results of 20.09, 20.1 and 19.98, in the same order
The current conditions of world growth have negatively impacted Brazilian exports as to what demand and prices are concerned
However, it considers that the high level of inflation in twelve months and the inflation expectations distant of the objectives of the inflation targeting regime do not allow monetary policy easing
In terms of the trajectory of consumer inflation over 2023, it should be noted that a relevant drop is expected in the twelve-month inflation during this second quarter, due to the base effect of the previous year
Such easing is also noticeable in Latin America, where the central banks in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil and Peru have continued the cycle of interest rate reduction
As a result, the Copom members concluded that the current scenario ceased to prescribe an extraordinary degree of stimulus, and that the Copom should begin a process of partial normalization of the policy rate
At this moment, the Copoms baseline scenario indicates that a partial normalization of the policy rate remains appropriate to keep some degree of monetary stimulus during the economic recovery
In fact, this process of delay on the normalization of monetary policy has been verified in the major part of mature and emerging economies
The volatility of international oil prices has worsened
In important emerging economies, however, the activity pace has not matched the expectations, despite the resilience of domestic demand
Short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation Returning to the domestic economy, recent persistence
The process of rebalancing the consumption basket, and, consequently, relative prices, between goods and services continues, with moderation in the consumption of goods in favor of greater demand in the services segment
This assessment is supported by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, despite at a moderate pace, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin
It is necessary to monitor possible impacts of higher uncertainty on the prospective path of inflation
The recovery in the Euro Area is uncertain, besides being slow and uneven across its economies, partly due to the fiscal consolidation and the difficulties experienced by the credit market
The Copom members then debated the level of economic slack
The Committee judges that the current scenario demands patience and serenity in the conduct of monetary policy
The BoE increased it assets acquisition program by 75 billion, to 275 billion, and the BoJ extended the deadline to the adhesion and the effective period of easing of eligibility conditions for the participation in the program of funds provision to the institutions located in calamitous areas
They concluded that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, is the best way to keep inflation on path towards the targets
The Committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current scenario, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions
Monetary Policy Guidelines Positive expectations regarding the Brazils economic performance in 2001 and 2002 contributed to the appreciation of the Real as well as to the reduction in Brazils risk
Regarding metal commodities, it bears highlighting the advance in the price of iron ore and the decline in the price of aluminum
Despite the negative retail sales results, the monthly FecomrcioSP survey showed a recovery in consumer confidence for the third consecutive month in June, signaling better prospects for the sector
This reduction, however, can be attenuated by the substitution of domestic supply by imported goods
This way, contrasting to what had happened in recent times, the net redemption of competitive debt was not significant
The low predictability of the asymmetric rebound of global economy, the dependence of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and the geopolitical complexity of the sector add uncertainty to oil prices forecasts
Even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since mid-2007, the Committee believes, according to information available at the moment, that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflationary scenario, evaluation corroborated by the recent upgrade to investment grade of Brazilian sovereign debt bonds
However, a reduction in the participation rate was observed
Industrial sales growth surpassed industrial production growth for the third consecutive month
By remaining ready to act as the balance of risks to inflation dynamics so requests, the Committee believes that it is, in fact, helping to sustain economic growth, which requires stability, predictability and consequent extension of the planning horizon for businesses and families, as well as to protect the substantial increases in real income of workers observed in recent years
The Copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit expansion, which had already been observed and tends to persist
They concluded in favor of signaling, conditionally, that if the outlook evolves according to the Copoms baseline scenario, and due to the stage of the easing cycle, a moderate reduction in the robust balance of payments, low inflation recovery of the economy acts in the opposite environment, anchored expectations and prospect of direction, by gradually pushing inflation towards economic recovery
However, available information scenario suggests that the impact of this drop in confidence on economic activity has been The uncertainty regarding the evolution of limited so far
In the first public offer, three year papers were offered, moving to four year securities in the remaining offers
In this regard, the Committee will continue to monitor, on the one hand, the process of withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus in advanced economies and, on the other hand, the Chinese reopening process
The Committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over time
The performance of retail activity reflects consumer perceptions
Data from CNI and from the Federation of Industries of So Paulo State Fiesp confirm a continuous expansion in the level of employment and in the real payroll in the manufacturing industry
In particular, they highlighted possible implications of the current scenario for the sensitivity of inflation especially in the service sector - to the level of economic slack, as well as for inflation dynamics in particular its inertial component
One group was in favor of a more parsimonious interest rate reduction
In the case of the secondary market, the National Treasury held two LTN purchase auctions with the objective of lessening the concentration of redemption volumes
These developments can be attributed to fiscal concerns in mature economies, notably in Europe
Regarding inflation, the Committee members mentioned results that printed above expectations in the short term, and the increase in projections for In this sense, they reasoned that the ongoing disinflation process has been evolving at a speed that is below the one pursued by the Committee
Copom assesses that there is a possibility of reversion, even if partial, of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency
On three different opportunities, two year NBCE were offered
A reduction in the slope of the term interest rate came along with a lower exchange rate pressure and a drop in Brazils risk
However, the projected inflation for 2004 and 2005 are below the February results for the same exercise, due to the substitution of the lower figure effectively observed for the expected inflation of the Top 5 forecasters for the month of February, to the reduction of expected inflation by those institutions for March and to the reasons mentioned in the paragraph above, regarding the GDP performance in 2003, the reduction in the projection for the regulated prices for 2004 and the downwards improvement of the 12-months-ahead inflation expectations
Utilizing Teledata figures, based on information gathered in 10 different cities, the default rate closed at 2.1, as against 2.4 in April 1999
Relatively to investments in the country, the index which takes into account domestic absorption of capital goods and production of inputs to the civil construction declined at the end of the first half of 2001, even though indices accumulated in 2001 still show growth
The Copom evaluates that emerging local inflationary pressures are more likely to represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory, because the heated demand can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation
Finally, in the balance of risks, besides the factors already mentioned, the Committee evaluates that the probability of the most extreme scenarios for the public debt trajectory has reduced, but also noted that there was no relevant change in the inflation projections since expectations did not change significantly
Business confidence remained positive, favoring the increase in output
Inflation remains at low levels in the advanced economies; and, in the emerging ones, it stands at high levels
The Copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has increased, because the heated demand and market of factors, in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some sectors, can increase the pass-through of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation
Regarding the factors market, as anticipated by previous Minutes, the Copom highlights that the narrow idleness margin in the labor market has eased at the margin, with some data indicating the start of a process of distension in this market
This process is supported not only by traditional sources of credit, but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial institutions
On the other hand, the Copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the long-term trend, in other words, it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices pressures
This movement is already seen, to some extent, and is already partially incorporated in the longer-term inflation expectations extracted from the Focus survey, as well as in the prices of several domestic assets
The weaker performance of these economies has reflected in the descending trajectory of price indices, which have also been responding to lower oil prices
Once it had been incorporated into the different forecasting estimates available to Copom, the new information contained in more recent price indicators resulted in a downward revision of the expected 2000 inflation figures
A scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rate increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus
In this sense, lower volatility in the exchange rate tends to minimize such a defensive behavior
Agricultural commodity prices reversed their downward trajectory in February, due to worse than expected harvests
Copom sustained its usual governance of incorporating the policies already sanctioned by law, but it acknowledges that the implementation of the proposed fiscal package could reduce the upside inflation risk
Despite the continuous fall in agriculture prices, industrial prices showed sharp increase in the period
Specifically, the US economy seems to have entered a process of economic stagnation since the last quarter of 2007, and still suffers the impact of the crisis in the real estate sector, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, in combination with higher oil prices, affects consumer confidence, contributing importantly to depress consumption
The Committee hightlights that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation, as well as in its composition, impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections
Copom recalls that there is no mechanical relationship between the conduct of the U.S. monetary policy and the determination of the domestic policy interest rate, and that it will focus on the transmission mechanisms from the external environment to the domestic inflationary dynamics
Nonetheless, despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil prices, the main scenario adopted by the Copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of However, it bears highlighting that, regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, or through the transportation costs for industry, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations
Regarding credit to individuals, the analysis indicates stability in the pace of credit approval destined to consumption and slight reduction to housing credit
Price increases are more widespread and also include items more associated with core inflation
The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, mainly, Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment
A more accentuated reduction in capacity utilization may be reflecting the lagged reaction of employment to the pace of economic activity and the effect of the energy crisis
Indicators and information available after the temporary halt in the transportation sector that occurred at the end of May 2018 point to the continuation of economy recovery of the Brazilian economy
in durable consumer goods, 1.6 p.p
The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last years
It represents the fourth consecutive monthly increase, and the recent recovery was mainly favored by the greater optimism of consumers regarding the future of economy
Consumer credit, that was displaying growing rates until October, recorded stability in November
The BCB decided not to rollover the FX debt and swaps maturing in January and in the beginning of February
Considering industrial segments, only pharmaceuticals and veterinary products expanded, 3.6 p.p., year-over-year
The scenario marked by a sound U.S. economy and resilient inflation permeates the debate on the sources, challenges, and uncertainties for the future disinflationary process in that country
Therefore, evidence suggests that the utilization rates have accommodated at high levels, and that the maintenance of the reduced idleness margin is the result of the recent economic activity expansion, still not totally offset by the maturity of completed and ongoing investment projects
Some measures of underlying inflation were considered to be at comfortable levels while others at low levels
Other monetary policy instruments are only complementary
In emerging economies, in general, the monetary policy bias is expansionist, which combines, in some cases, with other countercyclical policies
For example, there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to long-term equilibrium and, therefore, the effects of demand pressures and the high level of utilization of the factors on the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool down
In the FX markets, there is a consensus about the continuity of the dollar depreciation due to the increasing U.S. current account deficits
Approximately 58 of the revenues of the two sales were liquidated through the use of securitized credits for which the National Treasury was liable
All members concluded that such sizable, one-off and unusual fluctuations do not have relevant implications for the conduct of monetary policy
As with activity, the Committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic sectors
Nevertheless, other groups also showed a reduction of inflation pressures
Similarly, prices of international agricultural commodities and domestic food prices, which also contributed to disinflation throughout 2023, no longer suggest downside pressures with the same intensity in the next quarters
In April, employment in the manufacturing sector increased, while real payroll registered a slight decrease, although it kept in an upward trend
The Fed recognized that, although the interbank market functioning has improved, there are relevant difficulties in other markets, and credit conditions became more restrictive, in general
Labor markets in the industrialized economies continue to weaken with unemployment rates at high levels
On Regarding current inflation, the Committee the other hand, the process is long and involves members mentioned the favorable results in the uncertainties
The final impact on those markets will be greater the longer the higher interest rates last, which could lead to reallocations in the debt rollover process
Additionally, the Committee believes that this improvement in the perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity pace, both domestic and external, in this and in the upcoming semesters
Prospective assessment of inflation trends  An evaluation of the inflation outlook required identification of shocks with potential for generating impacts on future price level trajectories
The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, based on the 360-day swap rates, on the baseline scenario, estimates 103 bps and 5 bps spreads for the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, respectively
However, most of the committee members judged that this interpretation still seems premature and needs further corroboration by data
In relation to the macroeconomic environment considered in the December Inflation Report, the major difference is elimination of the doubts that had generated considerable wariness within highly computerized sectors of the economy as regards transition to the new century
The perception of economic slack for an extended period, along with the communication of central banks of major economies, creates an environment of liquidity and return of capital flows, favorable to emerging economies
The recovery, at the margin, in the dynamism of industrial production, led by production of durable goods, although more widespread than before, reflects, to a great extension, tax exemption measures and also some easing in credit conditions
Compared to July 2011, the rate decreased 0.9 p.p
The global outlook remains challenging, with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this year
The Committee perceives the need to maintain a still contractionary monetary policy in the relevant horizon to consolidate the inflation convergence to the target and the anchoring of expectations
It shall be stressed that the yen has shown appreciating trend vis-a-vis the American dollar inasmuch as the perspectives for longer deceleration in US become more evident
There is no mechanical relationship, however, between the global outlook and monetary policy
The Committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector in expansionist position
The outlook remains uncertain, however, and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth persist
between inflation expectations calculated by the Focus survey and the projections produced by the Monetary Policy Committee for the current year
On its turn, exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the BRL
The current lack of liquidity conditions and further deterioration of growth prospects are set to be the most likely scenario for the short and medium term, which contributes for the global financial system to remain under severe stress
This drop in the projection continues to be a consequence of the exchange rate appreciation observed in recent months
Notably, it might contribute to additional Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA reductions of inflation expectations and components that are most sensitive to the inflation in other sectors of the economy
Consumption and credit indicators confirm the outlook for strong improvement in the level of activity over the course of 2000 but do not constitute a source of inflationary pressures
Similar behavior has been observed when analyzing the trend of market prices
For 2014, in both scenarios, the inflation forecast is slightly above the midpoint inflation target
International liquidity and markets stability remain tied to macroeconomic conditions in the industrialized countries, especially the United States, and to the possible response of the Feds monetary policy to these economic developments
Despite the tight monetary conditions, Copom emphasized that a transmission of the monetary policy cycle expected by the market to the current rates of new credit grants is already taking place, leading, in particular, to greater dynamism in the capital market in the recent period
According to the market scenario, 2014 IPCA inflation forecast decreased, but is above the midpoint inflation target
The strong demand in the last months has had an impact on the trade balance with imports growing at a faster pace than exports
Industrial output increased by 3.1 in December and 4.4 in January, when compared to the same months of 1998 and 1999
It is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial prices
The deceleration in the US economy, the financial and capital markets swings and the effects of commodities prices rises increased the risk of deceleration in global economy
These distortions may not be completely eliminated with the application of usual seasoning adjustment procedures and tend to diminish February 2004 results and increase those of March
Finally, some members argued that the eventual There are risks that are inherent to the conduct end of the benign period for emerging economies monetary policy so that inflation projections, they may constitute both a risk and an opportunity
The baseline scenario for inflation and economic activity did not differ substantially from what was projected
This was mainly due to unfavorable performance of food prices
Out of the items related to the current situation, demand level, mainly domestic, and current situation of business continue to present favorable evaluation
As the initial monetary impulse loses momentum, and the economic recovery process begins to be sustained on its self-propagation mechanisms, it is natural and sound that, at the margin, production and sales growth rates decelerate
They discussed the risks respectively
The risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments, but show significant easing at the margin
Nevertheless, they believe estimate of its extension, a possible acceleration of that the Brazilian economy nowadays shows greater the pace is equivalent to greater frontloading of the capacity to respond to occasional negative cycle
Another possibility, albeit with lower impact on short-term changes, would be a higher neutral interest rate
From January to May, the trade balance registered a surplus of US 601 million, reducing the accumulated 12 month deficit to US 132 million
Notwithstanding expectations of lesser primary surpluses in the final months of the year, 1999 fiscal performance has been quite satisfactory and easily surpassed the targets defined in the economic program agreed upon with the IMF
With respect to the rate of exchange, the process of valuation of the nations currency that began in December was confirmed in average terms in the first half of January
Depending on the magnitude of such effects, the risks to the Brazilian economy stemming from future developments of the United States economy may offset each other
The Copom evaluates that, at the start of the year, inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply shocks, as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments
and 0.08 p.p., respectively, while the 2-year rate decreased 0.13 p.p
On the other hand, the Committee notices that the significant monetary policy easing, implemented from January to July, will have cumulative effects over the economy, which will be evidenced with a time lag
The Committee has been carefully pondering that international oil prices face a more adverse environment than the current one, but still regard it as a potential risk, though increasingly higher, for the materialization of the benchmark scenario
In fact, 305 thousand jobs were created in April and 962 thousand in the year through April
The forecast for 2005 remained unaltered
The Copom evaluates that the loss of strength on domestic demand should result in reduction of inflationary pressures
Conversely, important products in the consumer basket registered new price falls in August, including rice, black beans and soy oil
External shocks should be tackled only in the The Committee reiterates that economic secondary impact they may have on prospective conditions prescribe accommodative monetary inflation
In the absence of inflationary pressures, the basic interest rates remained steady in the central economies, except for the United Kingdom, where there was an increase of 25 b.p of the Bank of Englands repo rate
Prospectively, it is plausible to affirm that the announcement by Chinese authorities of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities prices
The most recent current crisis it moved to all countries, along with the readings of price indices showed significant pandemic
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates, increased in October for the second consecutive month, reaching 377 days
This low level of inertia was noted in the wake of the final quarter of 1999 and would now seem to be repeating itself, even though the economy as a whole is clearly in a stronger growth trajectory
In Argentina, the government has seek to revert negative expectations regarding the overall economy, while the countrys aggregate demand and industrial output has remained at low levels
The accumulated 12-month rates closed at 6.95, 8.04, and 7.86 in the month of February, viewed against corresponding December figures of 8.64, 9.12, and 8.94
These surveys also perceived a better prospect in terms of domestic demand
In December, this ratio had closed at 2.9
Copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information The Copoms inflation projections in the scenario and indicators
This is the only way to retain the disinflation gains obtained during 2003, not endorsing price increases in the sectors that benefited from the rebound in demand to contaminate overall inflation
This figure results from a model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation and the IGP change; e. However, general price indices have shown relatively higher rates
This is not unexpected, considering the relatively small share of the external sector on the Brazilian GDP
This difference can be explained by the low volume of public offerings and also the interest rate variation in the month
The second scenario The Committee also discussed the conditionalities assumes continuity of the strength exhibited in recent that would prescribe stimulative monetary policy
For the Committee, the trend for global activity shows more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant horizon
The Copom evaluates that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this year, compared to 2013, as well that, in the medium term, important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and demand
This applies to the favorable food supply shock and to the positive dynamics in prices of industrial goods, but also to potential inflationary relative price adjustments
Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the accumulated impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken
These auctions were used to fully rollover principal and interest payments due in maturing instruments in April19
The BCB also borrowed money through 30 overnight repo operations and conducted daily, at the end of day, two-working-day-tenure liquidity management operations
Regionally, 9 out of 27 Federation units reached positive results in July
Oil prices have fallen in the last weeks, but the market has remained volatile and lacking a clear trend, still representing a risk to price stability and to the global economic growth
This favors the continuity of adequate external financing of the current account balance, even in the context of lower direct investment flows
The IPC-DI acceleration in December was mainly influenced by the higher increases in the prices of food group, whose contribution to the monthly index increased from 0.13 p.p
This reflects the impact of both the international scenario and the energy crisis on expectations and domestic economy
Three selling offers of fixed income securities, with five-month tenure, were placed between June 20th and July 17th
They assessed that those economy is essential to the reduction of its structural measures are at appropriate levels, and that inflation interest rate
Rollover rates continue to recover, although they are at a reduced level, which contributed to negative FX flows in the first days of March
On the other hand, the deceleration of global economy has generated downturn pressures over wholesale prices, despite the exchange rate adjustment
While imports of fuels and lubricants expanded as a result of price growth, foreign purchases of raw materials were pressured by growth in the volume of imports
It is monetary authorities of some developed worth noting that the same does not occur under produced downward revisions in growth forecasts under the reference and market scenarios point to for the United Kingdom and the Euro Zone
The latter figure reflects growth of 0.4 in the production of consumer durables and 2.9 in semidurable and nondurable consumer goods
This highly adverse price shock has shown that it will be with us for some time to come and the probability of new highs will increase as winter in the northern hemisphere approaches
These elements contribute to the debate on the nature of inflationary pressures and, potentially, on the pace of monetary easing to be adopted by advanced economies
The evolution of price indices does not evidence existence of inflation pressures, enabling interest rate reduction
By sector, it is important to note the continuous expansion in the production of machinery and agricultural equipment, due to the increase in the income of the agricultural sector and the significant decrease in energy generating equipment
This percentage reflects the variations in the labor market after the minimum wage adjustment in May
In the period from December 19 and January 15, the Central Bank fully rolled the maturing exchange securities, including updated principal and final interests
above the observed in the same period of 2006 and 1.2 p.p
In the global economy, a scenario of low growth prospects in important advanced economies prevail, notably in the Euro Zone, and volatility indicators have responded to the prospects of monetary policy change in the US
The average tenure on non-earmarked credit operations, used as reference for interest rates reached 452 days, up from 448 days in June
The volume of capital goods imports declined by 7, based on information available up to April
Therefore, this easing of the monetary policy reflects the necessary caution in the administration of the risks between inflation and the continuity of the restore of the economic activity
In the same period, the BCB conducted 35 overnight repo operations, borrowing
In particular, some members assessed that some uncertainty persists among agents about overcoming fiscal challenges, evidenced in primary balance expectations that diverge from the targets set by the government, and that this may also be reflected in unanchored inflation expectations for longer maturities
With the substantial fall in the prices of oil and agricultural commodities, and the increase of unemployment, the inflationary process already records turning points in the majority of mature economies
For the next quarters, the continuity of the current expansion cycle of retail sales is expected, and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income growth, credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high levels
A slower normalization constitutes a downward risk to these projections
The Copom analyzed service price inflation and its components
After a long period of expansion, domestic demand has started to exert a contractionist influence over economic activity, despite the persistence of incentive factors, such as income growth
Besides, the lower liquidity of the sovereign securities markets increases risk perception and demand monitoring
Additionally, it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy actions, enabling them to affect in a more long-lasting manner the dynamics of 4 headline inflation in the future
In eleven out of the nineteen segments of the manufacturing industry, the Nuci presented positive performance month-on-month
They all agreed that there are signs consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run
November figures are expected to reveal a similar result with no significant pressures on production costs
On its turn, important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent quarters, and should contribute to consolidating the resumption of activity and hence, to reduce the residual idleness margin of productive factors
For September, the leading and coincident indicators available point to the continuity of the industrial production expansion cycle, which will be favored by the several stimulus factors that influence economic activity, including the monetary easing already implemented
These shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of new information
On the other hand, the increase of geopolitical tensions in Syria and Egypt translated into upward pressure for the oil prices
In the Euro Area, where the resumption of activity continues contained, the most recent data evidenced that consumer spending has not shown significant recovery yet and economic activity in the region continues to be driven mainly by the external sector
A stronger deceleration in the United States economy tends to generate a more favorable trend for interest rates and petroleum prices
The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may impose risks to the inflationary trajectory is limited
The Copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate, which, according to the Committees assessment, are largely permanent developments
These risks become more intense as the depreciation starts to be perceived as permanent and the demand recovers
Since December, the foreign sector and, more precisely, the trade balance has performed well and one can expect strong improvement in export operations
The improved prospects for the domestic economy accentuated the demand for fixed rate securities
Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debt at historically high levels
The Copom asserts that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the Couto Berriel
The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, with smaller and gradually increasing weight, The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level
According to the baseline scenario, which uses the interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and the exchange rate evolving according to the purchasing power parity, the inflation projections are above the target for 2022 and around the target for As for the balance of risks, the Committee pondered that the risk of a deanchoring of longer-term expectations, derived from developments in the fiscal scenario, points to an upward bias for the projections of its baseline scenario
The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are preserved
Other members drew attention to the disinflation in services prices already observed
On the one hand, manufacturing output fell
Data have also continued to indicate that employment has increased at a higher pace outside large metropolitan areas
Leading and coincident indicators anticipate a new increase in industrial output in February
Also, businesses have made an effort to regain profit margins in a scenario of falling aggregated demand
The labor market is starting to adjust, albeit gradually, to this environment, which shall exert additional pressure to the real wage bill, already affected by the impact from administered price adjustments
Economic activity continues to expand, but at a slower pace and more in line with supply conditions, so as not to result in significant inflationary pressures
Exports of sectors with higher capacity utilization level, such as metallurgy and paper and pulp, fell compared to June 2000, offset by increased exports of meat and soybeans
The Committee emphasized that the appropriate level of monetary tightening is also dependent on the prevailing fiscal framework
Basic interest rates fell in the United States and in Europe, and Argentina successfully completed a debt swap operation
The Copom evaluates that the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity - less intense than previously anticipated - is essentially due to limitations regarding the supply side
External Environment After the beginning of the war in Iraq, uncertainties on the external front subdued with indications that the war would be short and that there would be no significant damage to Iraqi oil fields
Notwithstanding, industrial surveys indicate reduction in employment in this sector
emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the The Copom reiterates its view that the continuity of evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian on inflation projections and expectations
The Copom evaluates that the loss of domestic demand dynamism should result in the reduction of inflationary pressures
These estimates naturally involve uncertainty and will continue to be reassessed by the Committee over time
Between June 7th and July 19th, one- three- six-month and one- and three-year rates increased by 0.62 p.p., 0.47 p.p., 0.21 p.p., 0.03 p.p
On January 31, the National Treasury held two NTN-C uniform price auctions
This movement was mainly caused by the uncertainty regarding both economic and political impacts, in the medium term, of the energy crisis and the election process next year
The Copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and GDP rates have converged; and that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this year, compared to However, according to the Committees view, the activity tends to go into recovery trend next year
Finally, the Committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing productivity, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvement of the business environment
The Committee unanimously decided to interrupt the easing cycle, highlighting that the uncertain global scenario and the domestic scenario, marked by resilient economic activity, an increase in its own inflation projections and deanchored expectations, require greater caution
Devaluation of the euro and sharp oil price increases are the factors that have created the greatest pressure on prices
However, a significant risk still prevails related, particularly, to the possibility of concession of high nominal wages increases, with negative impacts over inflation
In this context, even considering that, at the moment, the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate decision, the Committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different stance, by adjusting the monetary policy instruments, in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets path
No significant change occurred in the prospective scenario for the output gap, but a deeper debate took place about the effects of a possible greater-than- projected credit tightening on economic activity
The Committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline inflation, facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary authority, as well as help the process of coordination of economic agents expectations, mainly price setters
The volatility that has marked the major asset markets of the industrial countries obviously generates repercussions that affect perceptions of country risk and, consequently, the exchange rate trajectory
The main factor driving the liquidity contraction in the period was the net revenues of the Government
The nations surplus position in trade operations with Mexico, the United Kingdom and Chile increased further, while the deficit in operations with Venezuela also grew, in this case as a consequence of higher outlays on crude oil
rise in the adjusted inflation target for 2003, according to the methodology described in the Open Letter of the Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil to the Ministry of Finance of January 21, However, the Copom considers it premature to modify the adjusted target at this time due to the high volatility of international oil prices, and believes it is preferable to wait for more information about the adjustments that could affect regulated prices
Therefore, the Committee concluded that the appropriate degree of monetary tightening is significantly more contractionary than that used in the baseline scenario
For the Committee, all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence although, due to the 7 economic cycles themselves, specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the Brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and liquidity
The Committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices, such as in food and possible adjustments of electric power tariffs and fuel prices, will be symmetric, that is to say, monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply shocks
The December IPCA reflected pressures on both market and regulated prices
It is through such second-round effects and enhance Copoms communications
The National Confederation of Industry CNI registered growth in industrial employment since October, while the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo has perceived this trend since September
The US economy recorded, in July, the first monthly advance in industrial production since October 2008, and production of the Euro Zone has been showing stability since last April
The BCB also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working days
In this context, after a period of aggressive monetary policy easing, in several countries, monetary policy continues a phase of stability, whereas those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis and recover more quickly and intensely tend to adopt more restrictive monetary policy stance
above the level registered in the same month of 2006, while the average installed capacity utilization rate in the year stood 1.8 p.p., 1.7 p.p
Core inflation remained at moderate levels in the US, Euro Area and Japan, considering the relatively moderate prospects for the activity level in these regions
The Committee also stresses that monetary policy should continue being contractionary for sufficient time at a level that consolidates both the disinflation process and the anchoring of expectations around the targets
The recovery of semi and non-durable goods production, albeit less intense, have increased in tandem with the gradual improvement of domestic demand
The 62.4 result, in a scale ranging from 0 to 100, reflected greater optimism of businessmen in relation to both current conditions and next six months expectations
The Committee understands that, for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing cycle, the pace of easing depends on the stage of the cycle, without necessarily reflecting changes in the Committees baseline scenario or in the balance of risks
In seasonally adjusted terms, the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 p.p
The inflation rate increase in the short-term, caused by either seasonal factors or financial assets prices volatility, should not contaminate private expectations for longer periods
These conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and by inflation expectations anchored around the the structural interest rate of the economy, with the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy widespread benefits for society
At the external scenario, the possibility of Europes debt crisis deepening, the release of weaker economic indicators in Europe, US and China and the retreat of the North American treasuries rates have also contributed to the reduction of the future rates
Nonetheless, there is a significant risk factor in the external scenario
Between January 19 and March 9, one-, three-, and six-month rates decreased by 143 bps, 154 bps and 148 bps, respectively
The largest individual impact was of 0.07 percentage point from readjustments of electric energy tariffs
The Copom discussed the limitations on the use of this instrument in The Committee then assessed the appropriate emerging countries
Furthermore, the Copom emphasizes that the outlook for the upcoming semesters indicates moderation in the prices dynamics of some real and financial assets
After a brief contraction, domestic demand has recovered, largely thanks to the effects of stimulus factors, such as income growth and credit resumption
The Committee also notes that, according to the main scenario adopted, the inflation rate stands around the target in In short, the Copom considers that, at the present moment, the risks for the inflation trajectory remain limited
The economic activity in Japan, on its turn, shows signs of consistent expansion, led by exports, especially to Asia
Industrial output continued on a growth trajectory in the first four months of the year, registering accumulated growth of 4.03 in the 12 month period ended in June
Regarding monetary policy, advanced economies have persisted with strongly accommodative stances
Despite the recent reduction, driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high
For the Committee, these effects, the programs of public services concession, the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of businessmens confidence create prospects for investment intensification
Moreover, the Committee evaluates that, in the medium term, important changes should take place in the aggregate supply and demand composition
Particularly, monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices, partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global scale, do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to worse expectations
For 2014, the inflation forecast is around the midpoint inflation target in both scenarios
Business and consumer expectations decreased in September
in the IE and 0.4 p.p
On April 17, the median expectations of inflation as measured by the IPCA and collected through the daily Banco Central survey were still above the inflation target for 2000 6.48, as compared to a target of 6
had been considered adequate to begin this adjustment, as to smooth the inflexion of the monetary stance and minimize its initial turbulence risks, the Committee evaluates that, at this moment, a 0.5 p.p
Nevertheless, developments have so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of possible changes in economic policy in some large economies, notably in the United States
The members of the Committee also discussed the extent of the exchange rate pass-through in the Brazilian economy
In February, based on seasonally adjusted data, formal employment expanded by 0.4, with creation of 119.4 thousand jobs in the two-month period
The performance of consumer prices in the month of February demonstrated that the seasonal pressures generated by in natura foodstuffs and education outlays evident in the previous month had been dissipated
In such environment, the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that short-term uncertainties contaminate longer time horizons
This premium is dynamic and tends to be relevant monetary policy horizon, which currently larger in Brazil, given the countrys relative fiscal includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, This fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective information on inflation would be considered fiscal path
IPCA core inflation continued to accelerate in November, according to the three criteria by excluding regulated prices and household food, by smoothed and by non-smoothed trimmed-means
These elements and quasi fiscal developments are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be taken, aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets path
The members of the Copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to anchored inflation expectations and prospects of The members of the Committee also discussed the economic recovery
In this regard, the Committee believes that continued monitoring of these factors is necessary to assess whether the maintenance of interest rate rates for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure inflation convergence
At the São Paulo Consumer Protection Service SPC, the net default rate came to 7.2 in January, as compared to 8.5 in December
This increase was due to improved future expectations by consumers
Regarding inflation, as expected in the second stage of disinflation, the speed of disinflation is slowing down, requiring serenity and moderation in the conduct of monetary policy
It should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors, as suggested in some industrial surveys, indicates that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be greatly associated to productive capacity restrictions
In fact, the Icea remained above the IEC for the eighth consecutive month
By the way, despite the weakness of investment, which reflects, largely, the increased uncertainties and the slow recovery of confidence, domestic demand will continue to be driven by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently implemented, as well as by the moderate expansion of credit supply, both for individuals and corporate
The Committee will continue to reassess relative price shocks in an inflation targeting regime the estimates of this rate over time
The transportation group was the main responsible for deceleration of the index in June, with a contribution of 0.24 p.p., compared to -0.12 p.p
The Copom members debated on the level of economic slack
The BRL exchange rate has shown volatility in the period, reflecting the various changes in the domestic and international scenarios
The US consumer confidence increased in June to 101.9, after remaining nearly unchanged at 93.1 in the previous month
Regarding clothing, the recently seen pressures are expected to reverse due to early winter sales
Considering the hypothesis that important external variables continue under pressure for a longer period, the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime could judiciously absorb the primary shocks associated with this pressure
The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, an already anticipated trend, and which is in line with assessments present in previous Inflation Reports and Copom Minutes
Consequently, neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts yet, nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely materialized
The temporary halt in the transportation The Copoms inflation projections in the scenario sector in May, however, makes it more difficult to with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted assess the recent evolution of economic activity
The Committee recalled that the incorporation of scenarios and exogenous variables, such as fiscal dynamics or the external scenario, takes place through their impact on the prospective dynamics of inflation, with no mechanical relationship with the determination of the interest rate
On the other hand, in China, wholesale inflation increased in August
The Copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost, which, according to the Committees assessment, are largely permanent developments, have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest rates, including the neutral rate
In another dimension, as illustrated by actions that were implemented, the Committee 5 considers as opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit operations
