In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand
These cost factors are not expected to cause significant spillovers to the broader price trends, given the stable domestic demand conditions
The international economic and financial conditions have deteriorated much more significantly in the recent period
The overnight policy rate will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70
The pace and strength of the recovery, however, remain subject to downside risks emanating from both domestic and external factors
In 2005, the economy is still expected to grow at close to its potential despite a more challenging international environment
Private consumption will be supported by growth in income and employment, and measures implemented by the Government
In the advanced economies, growth has been modest and uneven
The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively
In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to ongoing global developments
External factors, namely shifting expectations of major economies monetary policy paths and ongoing geopolitical tensions, have led to heightened volatility in both capital flows and exchange rates across the region, including the ringgit
In Asia, growth continues to be supported by domestic demand and a gradual improvement in intra-regional trade
Going forward, the growth momentum is expected to continue in 2014, amid better performance in the external sector
While households are expected to continue adjusting to the GST in the immediate future, overall spending will be supported by continued wage growth and stable labour market conditions
While headline inflation has remained low in the recent period, it is projected to rise in the coming months as the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy lapses
While these positive developments are expected to continue going into 2010, the recovery is likely to be gradual and uneven, with the outlook remaining uncertain once the effects of the policy support begin to diminish
However, the absence of external price pressures and more moderate demand conditions are expected to mitigate the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation
Tighter global financial conditions and elevated political and policy uncertainty could lead to financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook
This is also supported by the favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer and business sentiments, low inflation and conducive credit conditions
Household spending continues to be supported by stable employment conditions and income growth
The global economy continues to improve at a moderate pace
Domestic headline inflation has increased to 2.4 in January 2011
Tourist arrivals have continued to rise, further lifting the tourism-related sectors
The recovery of the global economy is continuing, although the growth performance differs markedly across regions
Going forward, growth will remain anchored by domestic demand with additional support from the improved external environment
Prices are expected to rise at a gradual pace in the coming months, in line with the continued improvement in domestic economic conditions, and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices
Headline inflation is projected to peak in 3Q 2022 before moderating thereafter, due to dissipating base effects and in line with the expected easing of global commodity prices
Recent adjustments in the financial markets, though short-lived, indicate that volatility may reemerge
In this environment, the Asian economies are benefiting from stronger external demand amid sustained domestic activity
As projected, headline inflation peaked in 3Q 2022, while underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, has averaged 2.9 up to November 2022
Further normalisation to the degree of monetary policy accommodation would be informed by the evolving conditions and their implications to the domestic inflation and growth outlook
This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices
With some excess capacity in the economy, the strength of domestic demand is not expected to result in inflationary conditions
Both macro and micro prudential measures as well as supervisory oversight have resulted in more prudent lending standards and contained speculative activities in the property market
Looking ahead, the recovery in global growth performance has, however, become vulnerable to increased downside risks
Investment activity and private consumption have remained firm
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by robust domestic demand
However, the recovery in the services sector has been slower
Global energy and food prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year from their already high levels
Prices are expected to increase at a modest pace in the coming months, driven primarily by rising global commodity and food prices
Growth prospects should improve in 2021 with the expected containment of the pandemic
Looking ahead, the weaker external environment could, however, impact the overall growth prospects
In the major advanced economies, recovery remains gradual and uneven
The advanced economies continue to record modest growth
The degree of impact to the economy is highly dependent on the stringency and duration of containment measures
There are strong upside risks to global inflation due to sustained high food and energy prices
The sharp slowdown in global demand, the significant fall in commodity prices and the substantial decline in equity prices have exerted greater downward pressure on the growth prospects of regional economies
Improvements in exports have supported economic growth during the quarter while domestic demand remained firm
Looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by sustained private sector economic activity and further reinforced by public sector spending
Inflation continued to decline at a slower rate in October
Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support to growth
Overall, the economy is projected to expand within expectations in 2016, and to remain on a steady growth path in 2017
In emerging economies, while domestic demand remains an important source of growth, exports are affected by weak external demand
These positive developments are expected to continue into 2010, with growth in the domestic economy expected to continue to be supported by existing policy measures and the growing confidence in the private sector
Global trade has picked up significantly
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation1, remained stable at 1.6 in March 2019
Inflation is expected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors
The annual average headline inflation will be low in 2018
Headline and core inflation remain modest, averaging 1.8 year-to-date
Recent external and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets
Global growth, however, remains weighed down by persistent core inflation and higher interest rates
Inflation has been gradually rising due to disruptions in supply following adverse weather conditions and higher domestic costs
Headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year mainly reflecting the waning effect of global cost factors
The global economic recovery has continued in the first quarter of the year, but the growth has been highly uneven across regions
Despite the challenging environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 3.1 in 2021
Growth has become more entrenched and synchronised across regions
The latest indicators point towards sustained strength in economic activity driven by resilient domestic expenditure and higher export activity
Global growth prospects have also become more susceptible to increased downside risks in light of possible repercussions from the EU referendum in the United Kingdom
Looking ahead, inflation is expected to edge up driven by domestic cost factors
Sizeable fiscal and monetary stimulus in several major economies continue to support the recovery momentum
Inflation is expected to turn positive in the coming months, as domestic economic conditions strengthen
Investment activity is projected to be underpinned by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, particularly in the export-oriented industries, driven by favourable demand and efforts to enhance automation
In the domestic economy, a broad set of indicators suggests robust expansion in the fourth quarter of 2012
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from a slower momentum in major economies, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, an escalation of geopolitical tensions, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions
In October, the inflation rate eased further to 3.1
Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom
The MPC will also remain vigilant to the risks of destabilising financial imbalances
The outlook for growth continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly with respect to developments surrounding the pandemic
Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices
Private consumption will continue to be underpinned by stable employment and wage growth, while private investment will be supported by on-going multi-year projects in both export- and domestic-oriented industries
These factors more than offset the support from positive labour market conditions, and the full reopening of economies and international borders
Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued given the projections of weaker domestic growth prospects and labour market conditions
Nevertheless, greater weakness in the external environment is expected to affect regional growth prospects
Inflationary expectations are also well-contained
The current elevated inflation rate reflects the effects of the fuel and other administered price adjustments made earlier this year
Risks to the growth outlook have abated slightly, but remain tilted to the downside, primarily due to uncertainty over the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and effectiveness of the vaccination programmes
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, remains moderate
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent
For the Malaysian economy, the fourth quarter advance estimates for GDP affirmed that the overall growth for 2023 expanded within expectations
The MPC will continue to carefully assess the external developments and their implications on the Malaysian economy
However, in line with the relaxation of restrictions, latest high frequency indicators show that economic activity has recovered from the trough in July
For Malaysia, domestic demand continues to be the main driver of growth
In Asia, the better external environment provides further support to growth amid continued expansion in domestic demand
Domestic headline inflation has continued to increase, rising to 3 in March to average 2.8 for the first quarter of 2011
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2015
While the recent re-imposition of containment measures in select locations will affect economic activity in the short term, the impact will be less severe as almost all economic sectors are allowed to operate
Nonetheless, growth for the year 2020 is expected to be within the earlier forecasted range
Malaysias economic fundamentals are strongly anchored
In particular, continued aggressive adjustments in US interest rates and expectations of a higher terminal rate in the US, have contributed to a persistently strong US dollar environment
While domestic conditions remain favourable, uncertainties have emerged in the external environment arising from sustained high energy prices, geopolitical risks and possible moderation of global growth
The extent of upward pressures to inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls, fuel subsidies, and the prevailing spare capacity in the economy
A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs
Private investment is also projected to strengthen, underpinned by the improving outlook for the domestic economy and further expansion of new growth industries
Average headline inflation is likely to be negative this year, primarily reflecting the substantially lower global oil prices
The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings
Household and capital spending will continue to be driven by stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors such as manufacturing and services
In the recent months, global economic and financial conditions have deteriorated following the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the significant policy uncertainties
The various policy support packages will alleviate some of the financial burdens of households and businesses
Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, financial market volatility has increased substantially in the recent period as markets reassessed the direction of policy
Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged at 2.8
On balance, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand being the key driver of growth
The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter
The transition to endemicity on 1 April 2022 would strengthen economic activity, in line with further easing of restrictions and the reopening of international borders
International financial markets could also be subject to greater volatility going forward
Greater volatility in the international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from further escalation of geopolitical tensions, heightened volatility in global financial markets and slower growth momentum in major economies
Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, supported by improving incomes and overall labour market conditions, new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors
The Malaysian economy continued to expand in the first half of 2018, supported by private sector activity with additional impetus from net exports
However, there is now clearer evidence of the slowing growth in the major economies
As in the previous month, the decline largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008, and the easing pressure on food prices
In the Asian region, sustained domestic demand is projected to continue to support economic growth
Demand driven inflation remains contained
Global trade is expected to strengthen as the global tech upcycle gains momentum
The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments amid risks from prolonged supply-related disruptions
Despite the recent moderation in economic activity due to the Omicron-driven COVID-19 resurgences, the overall recovery trajectory remains on track
The expedited roll-out of mass vaccination programmes, together with ongoing policy support, are expected to lift global growth prospects going forward
The impact of the rapid decline in global demand on trade, production and investment activities in the Asian region has intensified
However, headline inflation is expected to remain low
For 2016, headline inflation is expected to be higher, to peak in the first quarter and moderating thereafter
Stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending
Tourist arrivals and spending are expected to improve further
Despite the signs of slowing global growth, commodity and food prices have continued to increase
Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, heightened volatility of financial markets and negative developments in the prices of key commodities
The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path
While growth has slowed in most of Asia, the region continues to record positive growth that is being supported by domestic demand
The growth has been supported by continued expansion in domestic private demand as well as robust external demand for Malaysia s exports
The downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased significantly
Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013
Given this improved economic outlook, the MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards normalising monetary conditions and preventing the risk of financial imbalances that could undermine the economic recovery process
For 2017 as a whole, headline inflation is expected to be at the upper end of the forecast range
Looking ahead, while the external sector performance is likely to be weighed down by slower global growth and trade tensions, economic growth will be supported by domestic demand
Food price inflation has, however, continued to increase
The ringgit exchange rate will reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede
Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018, but at a more moderate pace relative to the previous year
Economic activity in most major advanced economies is slower amid greater policy uncertainty while conditions in the international financial markets continue to be volatile
Inflation remains elevated in a number of countries, driven by both supply and demand factors
Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth
Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012
Downside risks to growth have increased following greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts
The Malaysian economy has performed well during the first half of 2006, sustained by robust domestic demand and strong global economic growth
The global economy continues to expand albeit moderately, supported by domestic demand amid improvement in trade activity
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5 and 1.5 for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy
The cost-driven inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions
Private consumption will be underpinned by stable income growth and favourable labour market conditions
In the advanced economies, the broad-based increase in investment amid the steady growth in consumption is raising growth prospects
The MPC will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth
Going forward, economic activity is expected to improve with domestic demand remaining the key driver of growth
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2014
Average headline inflation year-to-date is 0.3
While the growth outlook is subject to downside risks stemming from weaker-than-expected external demand and larger and protracted declines in commodity production, upside risks mainly emanate from stronger-than-expected tourism activity, a stronger recovery from the EE downcycle, and faster implementation of existing and new projects
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments, and will continue to monitor incoming data to inform the assessment on the outlook of domestic inflation and growth
In the region, while growth has moderated amid weaker external demand, domestic activity remains robust
Moving forward, the more challenging external environment has, however, increased the downside risks to the domestic economy
The growth of the Malaysian economy in the first quarter was within expectations
While the Malaysian economy is affected by these global developments, domestic demand has continued to support economic growth
While the macro and micro prudential measures have had a moderating impact on the growth of household indebtedness, the current monetary and financial conditions could lead to a broader build up in economic and financial imbalances
The ringgit is currently undervalued, given Malaysias economic fundamentals and growth prospects
Given that the Malaysian banking system remains fundamentally sound, the Banks efforts will continue to be directed towards ensuring access to credit to all sectors of the economy, and that the reduction in interest rates would be reflected in lower borrowing costs
Looking ahead, global growth will be supported by the emerging economies and the recovery in the advanced economies
At the same time, the MPC will also continue to monitor for risks of destabilising financial imbalances
The MPC will continue to assess the impact of the cumulative OPR adjustments, given the lag effects of monetary policy on the economy
Upside risk to inflation would be dependent on the extent of spillover effects of domestic policy measures, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments
Prices will gradually increase during the year, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices
Investment activity and prospects continue to be supported by the realisation of multi-year projects
The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and remains highly subject to any changes to domestic policy including on subsidies and price controls, financial market developments, as well as global commodity prices
Given these developments, the assessment going forward is for the global recovery to proceed at a more moderate pace
While these external developments may result in a moderation in the pace of growth of the Malaysian economy, moving forward, the overall growth will continue to be supported by the robust domestic economic activity
The export sector is expected to continue to support growth in an environment of greater resilience of the world economy to higher oil prices and amidst expectations for a moderation in global demand for IT products
Overall investment activity is expected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors
Looking ahead, global growth is expected to be sustained by positive labour market conditions, moderating inflation and less restrictive monetary policy
For Malaysia, the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the introduction of targeted containment measures has affected the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter of 2020
Looking ahead, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand remaining as the key driver of growth
Heightened market volatility, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh down on growth in the advanced economies
Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs
At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains supportive of the economy
The large decline in external demand has already led to a contraction in exports and a moderation in the pace of private investment activity
Investment activity is mainly led by the domestic-oriented industries, the commodity sector and the public sector
Nevertheless, global economic and financial conditions remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiments and heightened volatility in the international financial markets
The risks to the Malaysian economy are primarily from the external sector
For the Malaysian economy, the re-imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases had dampened the growth momentum
The change largely reflects the lapse of the impact from the adjustment to retail fuel prices in 2008
At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent
Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with support from various policy measures to raise disposable income
The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum
Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, market uncertainties on the direction of policy have resulted in substantial volatility in global financial markets
For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020
The economic impact from the recent increase in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant is expected to be considerably less severe than previous waves in the absence of stringent restrictions
The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments and policy measures to alleviate the cost burden of the public
The global recovery has continued in the second quarter, supported by robust and broad-based growth in most emerging economies, in particular Asia , and a moderate recovery in the advanced economies
The global economic expansion remains moderate
The projected improvement in the domestic economy is expected to be further supported by a gradual recovery in global growth conditions
While this will pose a risk to the Malaysian growth outlook, the strength of domestic fundamentals will have a mitigating role in reducing the impact
Labour market conditions have also improved in many countries
Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by conducive labour market conditions
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively
The contraction in global demand and trade, combined with the reduction in global commodity prices, has affected the export earnings of many of the regional economies, including Malaysia
Global headline and core inflation edged downwards in recent months but continue to be above average
Going forward, domestic demand will still remain the key driver of growth
Upside risks to inflation could however emerge in the event of supply disruptions that results in higher global prices for commodities
While the moderating trends will affect the overall growth prospect, the Malaysian economy is still projected to remain on a steady growth path
For 2016, inflation is expected to be higher compared to 2015, given the adjustments in administered prices and the weaker ringgit exchange rate
For the Malaysian economy, latest developments point towards further expansion in economic activity in the first quarter of 2023 after the strong performance in 2022
Consumer spending is expected to remain robust and private investment is expected to be sustained as companies expand capacity
In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market
For Malaysia, the strong growth performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be anchored by private sector spending
Liquidity remains ample, augmented by liquidity injections by Bank Negara Malaysia
Going forward, the economy is expected to expand further in 2010, with growth being supported by strengthening domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and further improvements in external demand
The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals
In particular, aggressive adjustments in US interest rates have contributed to a strong US dollar environment
The impact of subsidy adjustments on consumption spending is expected to be contained by targeted financial assistance
For the Malaysian economy, economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months
The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 600 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting
Private consumption is, however, expected to moderate as households continue adjusting to the higher cost of living amidst an uncertain economic environment
In Asia, growth has been sustained by improvements in export performance amid moderating domestic economic activity
Together, these measures will cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and support the improvement in economic activity
Investment activity and prospects have also improved, underpinned by the realisation of multi-year projects and positive growth outlook
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators are in line with expectations, suggesting moderate expansion of economic activity for the third quarter
The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery
Consequently, the Bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term, the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity
The growth of financing to the private sector has improved, consistent with the pace of economic activity
Underlying inflation is expected to remain broadly stable, reflecting the continued expansion in economic activity and the absence of strong demand pressures
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 75 basis points to 2.50 percent with immediate effect
For 2021, growth will be within the projected range of 3 - 4
The strong imports of capital goods, manufacturing investment approvals and foreign direct investment inflows are indicators of sustained investment activity
Nevertheless, the trend of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain
The price pressures being experienced by the global economy are expected to persist over the medium term, arising from higher food, fuel and commodity prices
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average below 1.0 for the year
The intensification of global trade tensions could affect sentiments and weigh on trade, investment and consumption
In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to have peaked in 3Q 2022 and is expected to moderate thereafter, albeit remaining elevated
The MPC is not on any pre-set course, which means that monetary policy decisions will continue to depend on evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth
On the external front, global growth is expected to continue to support the growth of the Malaysian economy
The outlook, however, is subject to global commodity price developments
Looking ahead, structural issues and geopolitical developments will continue to constrain growth of the global economy despite the highly accommodative monetary conditions
The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 600 p.m. on the same day as the Monetary Policy Committee meeting
While inflationary pressures are not expected to intensify, the rate of inflation is expected to remain in the region of the current levels for some time
Substantial policy stimuli introduced by many economies, coupled with the gradual easing of containment measures globally, would partially mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19
Private consumption and investment activity also continued to sustain domestic demand amid a slower pace in public sector spending
Additionally, the reopening of international borders since 1 April 2022 would facilitate the recovery in tourism-related sectors
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative
The growth would be driven mainly by domestic demand, fuelled by private sector consumption and investment, with the public sector playing a strong supportive role
In the MPCs assessment, while inflation remains a concern, the increased uncertainties on the global and domestic economic growth prospects and their potential consequences could have a moderating impact on inflation
The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has continued to stabilise
In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by sustained domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid the weaker external environment
At the current OPR level, the monetary policy stance remains supportive of the economy and is consistent with the current assessment of inflation and growth prospects
The latest available data from the major industrial economies indicate a moderation of economic activity in these countries
Bank Negara Malaysia today announced that the Overnight Policy Rate OPR is raised by 30 basis points to 3 percent
For Malaysia, supply disruptions in the mining and agriculture sectors led to more moderate growth in the second quarter of 2018
The global economic expansion remains moderate, with divergent growth momentum across economies in the first quarter of 2015
Exports and industrial production have declined steeply, while private investment activities have slowed down in recent months as businesses scaled back their spending
Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely the evolving developments and will undertake the appropriate policy response to avoid a severe economic downturn
As in other regional countries, Malaysias export growth has, however, slowed in recent months
Positive developments in manufacturing production, financing activity, external trade and labour market conditions reaffirm the assessment that the economic recovery is gaining strength
The global economic activity is showing signs of improvement, albeit at an uneven pace

Amid continued strength in global demand, supply chain disruptions, higher commodity prices and labour shortages, inflation has also risen
The global economy continues to experience modest growth
Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies
Looking ahead, growth is expected to gain further momentum in 2022
The latest indicators have continued to signal further improvements in the international economic and financial conditions
However, shifts in global liquidity have resulted in significant capital flows into the emerging economies, in particular, into the Asian region, and have brought with it risks to macroeconomic and financial stability
The future thrust of monetary policy will depend on further information on the relative dominance of either risk going forward
Global commodity and energy prices are projected to remain elevated during the year, with inflation in major trading partners also expected to rise further
Global economic conditions have weakened in the recent period
In the MPCs assessment, there remain continued uncertainties emanating from the global economic and financial environment
Banking system liquidity remains ample
Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely and assess the evolving developments in setting future monetary and financial policies
On the external front, while export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, manufactured exports will continue to benefit from the improvement in economic activity in several advanced economies and the sustained growth in Asia
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators and supply disruptions in commodity-related sectors point to moderate expansion of economic activity in the fourth quarter
Coming off a strong performance in 2022, growth in 2023 is expected to moderate amid a slower global economy
Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged 2.3, and is projected to average between 2.0 and 3.0 for 2021

Domestic demand is expected to moderate, reflecting the public sector consolidation and some moderation in private consumption
Banking system liquidity remains sufficient
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments to inform the assessment on the domestic inflation and growth trajectories going into 2025
Several regional economies have reported positive growth in the third quarter, indicating that recovery in the region is ongoing
Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and from regional demand
Meanwhile, upside risks to growth mainly emanate from greater spillover from the tech upcycle, more robust tourism activity, and faster implementation of investment projects
Some weakening in the international economic conditions could affect export growth
Going forward, growth is expected to remain anchored by firm private sector expenditure
Nevertheless, upward pressure on prices would be partly contained by existing price controls and the continued spare capacity in the economy
Moving forward, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
The ringgit currently does not reflect Malaysias economic fundamentals and growth prospects
In the Malaysian economy, the expansion in domestic activity was supported by improvements in exports
Tourist spending is expected to continue to increase
Overall, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path
In Asia, growth will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand
Headline inflation moderated to 3.9 in May, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices during the month
Weaker international oil and commodity prices and global competition, combined with a moderate environment of wage and price increases in the domestic economy sustained the downward trend in inflation
The Malaysian economy is therefore expected to sustain steady growth over the medium term
The adverse global developments have already affected the Malaysian economy, as evidenced by the slowdown in export performance and lower equity prices
Private consumption will be supported by stable employment conditions, income growth and public sector measures
As expected, both headline and core inflation have moderated, mainly due to easing cost pressures
The region is also being affected by global inflationary pressures arising from the higher commodity and food prices
Uncertainties in the global economy, the policy environment and geopolitical developments may, however, result in bouts of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets
Investment activity would be supported by continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects
The impact of the consumption tax policy on headline inflation in 2019 will start to lapse towards the end of the year
These global developments have prompted authorities to provide significant liquidity support to the financial system, undertake financial sector resolution measures, as well as fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to support economic growth
While the growth outlook is subject to some downside risks stemming from weaker-than-expected global growth, upside risks mainly emanate from domestic factors such as stronger-than-expected tourism activity and faster implementation of projects
Nevertheless, the pace of recovery will be uneven across sectors, with economic activity in some industries remaining below pre-pandemic levels, and a slower improvement in the labour market
Growth momentum has been lifted by stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy as firms invest in productive capacity, raise wages and hire more workers
Risks to growth are tilted to the downside, primarily from potential escalation of trade tensions and commodity-related shocks
Malaysias favourable economic prospects and domestic structural reforms, complemented by ongoing initiatives to encourage flows, will continue to provide enduring support to the ringgit
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity
With this decision, the MPC has withdrawn the monetary stimulus intended to address the COVID-19 crisis in promoting economic recovery
Nevertheless, given the modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices are likely to be contained
Over the medium term, domestic structural reforms will provide more enduring support to the ringgit
Although pressures in the international financial markets have receded following the recent policy announcements to address the European crisis, a number of important policy issues remain unresolved and continue to unsettle financial markets
The global growth momentum has continued to be modest
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2010
Going forward, growth is expected to strengthen further, supported by domestic demand and continued improvement in external demand, particularly from the regional economies
Additional policy support, particularly in the US, is expected to lift growth further
Further progress in the financial sector resolution has also been made in several advanced economies, the success of which is a key precondition for the stabilisation of economic and financial conditions
Consequently, several central banks are expected to adjust their monetary policy settings at a faster pace to reduce inflationary pressures
Overall, there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic environment over the policy horizon
Growth will remain driven by domestic demand
Nevertheless, volatility in the international financial markets has increased following concerns over the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in several advanced economies
The positive growth performance is expected to be sustained, driven by both domestic and external demand
In the MPCs assessment, there continue to be uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Looking ahead, the baseline estimate is for global growth to improve slightly in 2017
The cumulative impact of previous price adjustments will cause inflation to peak in the third quarter of 2005, and to moderate thereafter
The robust expansion in investment activity would be sustained by the progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the higher realisation of approved investments, as well as the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans
The Malaysian economy expanded by 7.6 in the first quarter of 2004
The Malaysian economy has continued to perform well during the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong domestic demand

Global headline and core inflation edged downwards in recent months with prospects of monetary easing in some countries in the second half of the year
The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Both headline and core inflation averaged 1.8 in the first five months of the year
At the same time, the MPC also recognizes the need to ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build up of financial imbalances that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time
Headline inflation is likely to turn negative in some months and remain low in the first half of 2019 before trending upwards as these transitory effects lapse
The global economy registered a stronger than expected recovery in the first quarter, underpinned by favourable growth performance in emerging market economies and some of the advanced economies
Going into 2024, inflation is expected to remain modest
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2020
The Malaysian economy has been adversely impacted by these global developments
Moving forward, monetary policy would remain accommodative to ensure that the economic recovery is well entrenched
Inflation in 2024 is expected to remain moderate, broadly reflecting stable demand conditions and contained cost pressures
The MPC will ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable economic growth amid price stability
The ringgit continues to be primarily driven by external factors, namely expectations of major economies monetary policy paths and ongoing geopolitical tensions
Globally, financial markets have remained stable
However, this will be transitory as headline inflation is projected to moderate thereafter as this base effect dissipates
This normalisation of monetary conditions also aims to mitigate the risk of broader economic and financial imbalances that could undermine the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The financial sector remains sound, with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers
Global energy and commodity prices are also likely to be contained given the weak global conditions
Headline inflation increased to 0.2 in March 2019 February -0.4, due mainly to the less negative transport inflation at -3.0 February -6.8
Going forward, the economic outlook for Malaysia remains favourable
In 2024, inflation is expected to remain modest, broadly reflecting stable cost and demand conditions
Monetary policy will continue to balance the risks to inflation and growth
The growth outlook will be further supported with greater certainty in domestic policy in the coming months
The MPC will also continue to monitor the risks of destabilising financial imbalances
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average between 2.0 - 3.0 in 2022 as demand continues to improve amid the high-cost environment
1 Core inflation is computed by excluding price-volatile and price-administered items
Domestic investment activity which has been robust will continue to be led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects
At its meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysias Monetary Policy Committee MPC decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate OPR unchanged at 3.50 percent
For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018
The Malaysian economy continued on a steady growth path, with real gross domestic product increasing by 5.8 in the third quarter
To further reduce the cost of intermediation, the MPC also decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Requirement SRR from 4 to 3.5, with effect from 1 December 2008
The recovery in the global economy is progressing amidst continued policy support and improvements in financial conditions
While domestic headline inflation rose towards the end of 2010, it has remained low at 2.2
Since our August Monetary Policy Statement, indicators now show that the economy is stronger, and economic activity is expected to gain momentum going into next year
The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more synchronised across countries
In the MPCs assessment, there are increased uncertainties to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Financial conditions remain supportive of growth
The MPC will also continue to assess risks of destabilising financial imbalances
Consequently, central banks are expected to continue adjusting their monetary policy settings, some at a faster pace, to reduce inflationary pressures
The pace of recovery, however, varies across countries
Going forward, indicators point to continued growth, underpinned by support from private sector spending
The MPC remains vigilant to cost factors, including those arising from financial market developments, that could affect the inflation outlook
The future stance of monetary policy would therefore depend on Bank Negara Malaysias assessment of new information regarding the domestic and international environment and their implications on the Malaysian economy
Despite the global financial turmoil, domestic credit conditions have remained favourable as demand for financing continues to be supported by the ample liquidity in the financial system
In the domestic economy, the pace of recovery is gaining momentum
Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and regional demand
The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite periods of volatility primarily due to global developments
This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions including from further stress in the banking sector
Domestic economic activity, however, remains strong
In this challenging environment, the Malaysian economy is expected to expand at a more moderate pace in 2016 after registering a 5 percent growth in 2015
For 2019, domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth
For the regional economies, after registering strong economic expansion in the first half of the year, the slower pace of export growth will have some impact on economic performance
In confronting this more difficult environment, the Malaysian economy will benefit from having diversified sources of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, manageable level of external debt, and a well-capitalised banking system and developed capital markets that provide continued access to financing
Going forward, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors
Emerging economies, however, are recording a stronger recovery
The global growth momentum has moderated in recent months
Financial conditions also remain supportive
Labour market conditions and income prospects remain positive, with unemployment and underemployment declining further
In the region, the recovery continues, although the pace of economic growth has moderated arising from a weakening of external demand
It also excludes the estimated direct impact of tax policy changes
While some uncertainty still remains, the broad underlying trend towards lower inflationary pressures is expected to continue into 2007
The progress of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme will also lift sentiments and contribute towards recovery in economic activity
Furthermore, in the event that global growth is lower than currently projected, it would have a mitigating effect on global prices
Several major economies have begun relaxing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the gradual resumption of economic activity
Global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets
The decline in consumer prices, however, is expected to be temporary
Investment activity is also projected to remain robust, led by capital spending by the private sector, particularly in the mining, manufacturing and services sectors
For the Malaysian economy, the advance GDP estimate points to an improvement in economic activity in the third quarter
However, downside risks to growth remain
The impact of these cost factors is, however, expected to be mitigated by the continued low energy and commodity prices and the generally subdued global inflation
Going forward, exports are expected to be supported by the global tech upcycle, continued strength in non-EE goods and higher tourist spending
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained
At its meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysias Monetary Policy Committee decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate OPR unchanged at 3.50 percent
This is expected to be partially offset by the overall lower global commodity and energy prices
The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments to inform the assessment on the domestic inflation and growth trajectories
The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments, arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions, as well as domestic policy measures on administered prices
For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued strength in exports and private sector activity
The Malaysian economy grew within expectations in the first quarter of the year, supported by both domestic and external factors
Downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, higher risk aversion in global financial markets amid more aggressive monetary policy tightening in major economies, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and re-emergence of significant supply chain disruptions
Measures under Budget 2024 will also provide additional impetus to economic activity
The global economy continues to expand albeit with some divergence across economies while global trade sustained its growth momentum
The global economy continues to expand moderately
The MPC recognises that there are downside risks in the global economic and financial environment and is closely monitoring and assessing their implications on domestic price stability and growth
Looking ahead, global growth is expected to be sustained, as headwinds from tight monetary policy and reduced fiscal support will be cushioned by positive labour market conditions and moderating inflation
Since March 2020, Bank Negara Malaysia has provided additional liquidity of approximately RM42 billion into the domestic financial markets, via various tools including outright purchase of government securities, reverse repos and the reduction in Statutory Reserve Requirement
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.00 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively
The expansion of the Malaysian economy continues to be well supported by strong underlying fundamentals
Investment activity would be supported by the ongoing progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans, as well as the higher realisation of approved investments
Bank Negara Malaysias monetary operations continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity
While the Malaysian economy is affected by the global developments, domestic demand has continued to support growth, driven by firm consumption and investment activity
The inflation rate is expected to edge upwards in the next few months, before moderating in the later part of 2005
In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year
Underlying inflation, however, is expected to remain relatively subdued in 2022
The MPC views the latest data on key international and domestic economic variables as being supportive of its assessment that going forward, the risks to inflation are on the upside, while the risks to growth are on the downside
The growth trajectory is projected to improve from the second quarter onwards
While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the pace of recovery has continued at a modest and uneven pace
Exports and retail spending indicators affirm the positive growth momentum, supported by the transition to endemicity
Going forward, unresolved trade tensions remain a key source of risk, affecting global trade and investment activities
This is consistent with the monetary policy stance of supporting a steady growth path amid price stability
The growth would be mainly private sector driven, with the public sector having a strong supportive role
Based on this assessment, the current level of the OPR is consistent with the medium term outlook for growth and inflation
In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014
The fiscal stimulus packages, alongside monetary and financial measures, will continue to underpin the improving economic outlook
The Malaysian economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2017
Looking ahead, despite the varying impacts of the significantly lower oil prices on economies, the overall global economy is expected to benefit from this development
Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and volatility in global financial markets
Going forward, these domestic drivers of growth, alongside stable labour market and wage growth, are expected to remain supportive of economic activity
While the risks of destabilising financial imbalances are contained, the MPC will monitor these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects
Domestic inflation edged higher in June and July mainly on account of increases in food and energy prices
In the advanced economies, growth will continue to be mainly driven by positive labour market conditions and policy support
While domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth, there are some signs of tightening of financial conditions
The adjustment to the OPR is intended for the degree of monetary accommodativeness to remain consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy
Global trade is showing strong growth momentum
In the advanced economies, rising wages and policy support will provide further impetus to growth
The meeting also approved the schedule of Monetary Policy Committee meetings for 2008
Domestic demand therefore remains the main driver of growth
The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy
Mitigating factors that would prevent inflationary pressures from building up include growing productivity and capacity expansion, as well as a lack of significant general demand pressures
Going forward, the Bank will maintain its focus on the medium term outlook for inflation and growth, and will carefully assess global and domestic developments in setting the stance of monetary policy
The overall outlook remains subject to downside risks, primarily due to the risk of further resurgence of COVID-19 infections which could lead to weaker business, employment and income conditions
These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy
The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments
Given the improvement in economic activity amid lingering cost pressures, underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to trend higher to average between 2.0 - 3.0 in 2022
This will continue to pose headwinds to the global growth outlook
This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The recovery in the global economy continues to gather pace, supported by continued expansionary economic policies, improved financial conditions and a strong rebound in several emerging economies
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate OPR at 3
With improving domestic economic conditions, and as price pressures and inflationary expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support to economic activity
The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically
For 2018, the global economy is projected to experience sustained growth
The prospects are for the economy to expand within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year and 4 to 5 percent in 2016
The overnight policy rate OPR will therefore remain unchanged at its current level of 2.70
The MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards further normalisation of monetary conditions
In line with earlier assessments, the average headline inflation is expected to be negative in 2020 due mainly to the substantially lower global oil prices
Global economic expansion continues, albeit at a more moderate pace, across major advanced and emerging market economies in the first quarter of the year
However, the MPC will be monitoring these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects
Domestic headline inflation increased to 3.3 in May on account of higher food and fuel prices
The labour market is further lifted by a lower unemployment rate, higher labour participation and better income prospects
The risk to domestic price stability is now substantially reduced
Inflation during the first four months of 2007 averaged 2.4 and has continued its downward trend
Due to the revised schedule of international meetings, the September MPC meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday 10 September and Friday 11 September 2015, from Wednesday 2 September and Thursday 3 September 2015
The external sector will continue to be constrained by weak external environment
Inflation is expected to be contained in 2007 due to lower import prices and expansion of domestic capacity
In the emerging economies, growth is projected to be supported by sustained domestic activity and stronger external demand
Given the uncertainties associated with both the inflation and economic outlook, particularly in relation to the impact of high oil prices, the balance of these risks will be closely monitored in setting the future course of monetary policy
The MPCs assessment is that the risks to inflation are on the upside
In the advanced economies, diminishing labour market slack and additional policy support will provide further impetus to growth
Going forward, inflation is, however, expected to remain above its long-run average due to the higher domestic cost factors
While export growth will be affected by the lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve
Looking ahead, while global growth is expected to continue, the outlook is vulnerable to downside risks arising from the prevailing fragilities that are both cyclical and structural, excessive leverage, the sharp declines in commodity prices and the rising geopolitical risks
On the demand side, growth remained supported by private sector activity with further impetus from net exports
BNM will continue to manage risks arising from heightened financial market volatility
Growth will be underpinned by the firm expansion of domestic demand
However, global growth continues to be supported by improvements in labour market conditions, and the full reopening of most economies and international borders
Growth in the advanced economies during this period has remained modest
The ringgit, along with most emerging market currencies, has experienced sharp adjustments and significant volatility due to continuing uncertainties in global economic and policy environment, and geopolitical developments
The sharply adverse global developments have resulted in steep declines in Malaysias exports and industrial production, which have in turn affected private sector activity and labour market conditions
Support from the external sector is expected to soften, in tandem with the moderating global growth momentum
Furthermore, while exports of electrical and electronic products have contracted, net exports have remained firm, supported by stronger exports of commodities and resource-based manufactured goods
The Malaysian financial system remains strong and the monetary transmission process is functioning to deliver the impact of the policy stimulus to the economy
While export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve
The overnight policy rate OPR will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70
