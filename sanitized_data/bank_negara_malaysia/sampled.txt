Global inflation has, however, increased on account of rising energy and commodity prices
Domestic demand will continue to be the anchor of growth, supported by private consumption and investment and reinforced by public sector spending and investment activity
Moving forward, headline inflation is expected to peak in early 2016 and it will moderate for the remainder of the year
While domestic demand remains resilient, there are indications of slower private sector activity amid some softening in the labour market conditions and a more challenging business environment
This is supported by the sustained implementation of fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy and continued access to financing
However, these have been partly offset by the impact from rising cost pressures, the military conflict in Ukraine and strict containment measures in China
Following a strong outturn in the first quarter of the year, the Malaysian economy expanded at a more moderate pace in recent months as exports were weighed down by slower external demand, as expected
Going forward, downside risks to growth, however, have risen amid greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts
For Malaysia, the stronger economic growth performance in the second quarter of 2019 was underpinned by the resilience of private spending amid broad-based expansion in key economic sectors
Investment is being led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas industry and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects
Going forward, the domestic economy is expected to sustain a steady growth
These developments are affecting growth in the rest of the world
The current level of the OPR is consistent with the medium term outlook for growth and inflation
The MPC will continue to monitor the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2025
Domestic demand, however, is expected to moderate, reflecting the ongoing public sector consolidation and a slower growth in private consumption
Going forward, the degree of monetary accommodation may need to be adjusted to ensure that the risks arising from the accumulation of these imbalances would not undermine the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
There remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets
The assessment is for a slower global growth with a more protracted and significant slowdown in a number of the developed economies and some moderation in growth in the emerging economies
The prospects are for domestic demand to remain as the key driver of growth
Headline inflation declined in January and is expected to remain low in the first quarter of 2015
Headline inflation continued to moderate, but core inflation has persisted above historical averages
Going forward, the lower cost pressures and the slowdown in demand are expected to exert a greater dampening influence on inflation
While the global economy continues to expand, the recovery in the advanced economies has not been as strong as earlier expected and the growth in the emerging economies has slowed
While the liquidity in the financial system has been manageable, going forward, additional policy tools such as the statutory reserve requirement and macroprudential lending measures may be considered to avoid the risks of macroeconomic and financial imbalances
Labour conditions in the advanced economies remain firm, while domestic demand continues to support growth in Asia
Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside due to external and domestic factors
While growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest
Consequently, as the effect of the increase in retail petroleum prices lapses, inflation has moderated to 1.5 in March
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively
However, downside risks to growth continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation1 remained stable at 1.5 in January 2019 reflecting sustained demand conditions
This will be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability
Economic indicators in the large industrial countries are increasingly indicating heightened downside risks to the prospects for global growth
Under these circumstances, the urgent implementation of policy measures will be key towards ensuring that the Malaysian economy continues to experience positive growth in 2009
Meanwhile, inflation decelerated to 3.5 percent in March, and is expected to moderate further amid subdued demand conditions and lower external price pressures
The assessment is therefore for the economic growth to remain within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent
The global economy has strengthened further, with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across regions
However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil prices
The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.75 percent and 3.25 percent respectively
Although external factors, including rising global commodity and food prices, may exert some additional upward pressure on domestic prices, overall inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2010
Investment activity will be supported by the domestic-oriented industries, the commodity sector and the public sector
Investment activity is projected to remain resilient, with broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors cushioning the lower oil and gas-related investment activity
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 50 basis points to 2.00 percent
These factors more than offset the support from positive labour market conditions, and the full reopening of most economies and international borders
Although the global recovery is expected to continue going forward, downside risks have increased, arising from the potential for higher energy and commodity prices, possible supply disruptions following developments in Japan, and the heightened volatility in capital flows to emerging economies
On the external side, the global economy is expected to show continued growth in 2005, despite some moderation in that growth rate
In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial markets
This suggests that the global economic recovery will likely remain uneven in the near-term
On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2019
With the growth of domestic demand being sustained, the more positive contribution from the external sector will lead to a better performance of the Malaysian economy
Financial markets have also been relatively calm in the recent period
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from further escalation of geopolitical tensions, volatility in global financial markets, and slower growth momentum in major economies
Industrial activity and global trade have picked up
The change in the OPR is intended to align monetary conditions to the current environment
Risks to the domestic growth outlook are relatively balanced
At its meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysias Monetary Policy Committee MPC decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate OPR unchanged at 3.50 percent
The overnight policy rate will continue to remain unchanged at the current level of 2.70
In the immediate term, the economy faces downside risks stemming from heightened trade tensions, prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors and some domestic policy uncertainty
For the year as a whole, average headline and core inflation are expected to remain within the earlier projected ranges and are unlikely to exceed 3
Risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside due to external and domestic factors
Despite the challenging global and domestic environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 4.2 in 2016
These have partly cushioned the impact of the military conflict in Ukraine and the strict containment measures in China
In the advanced economies, rising income and policy support, particularly in the US, will continue to drive growth
Measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted economic activity across most economies
Global financial market conditions are likely to be susceptible to policy and market developments
These conditions are expected to continue with the slowing of global growth
Headline inflation for 2018 is projected to be lower than earlier forecast taking into consideration the impact of recent policy measures on domestic cost factors
Headline inflation averaged at 1.0 in 2018
Growth will also be supported by higher production from existing and new manufacturing facilities, particularly in the EE and primary-related sub-sectors, as well as oil and gas facilities
Global headline and core inflation continued to edge downwards in recent months with some central banks commencing monetary policy easing
Domestic consumer price inflation in Malaysia increased to 3 percent in April 2008 and is primarily being driven by higher food prices
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent respectively
Nevertheless, risks to inflation could emerge arising from supply disruptions that would result in higher food and commodity prices
The recent escalation of trade tensions point to weaker global trade going forward, with increasing signs of spillovers to domestic economic activity in a number of countries
In most of Asia, while there has been a moderation in growth, domestic demand continues to support economic activity
Overall, both headline and core inflation for 2023 are within expectations, averaging for the year at 2.5 and 3.0, respectively
Private consumption will be supported by sustained employment and income growth, while the favourable outlook in the domestic-oriented sectors and the expansion of new growth industries will provide support for continued private investment activity
Financial markets continue to face intermittent volatility amid rising trade tensions
Public sector spending, however, is likely to weigh on growth, amid continued reprioritisation of expenditure by the Government
Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and information and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth
Recent data have shown inflation edging up, reflecting adjustments to rising costs resulting from higher input prices
Financial conditions have improved, although risk aversion remains elevated
On the global front, while the monetary policy stance is likely to remain tight in the near term, the tightening cycle has peaked for most central banks
Investment activity is projected to be sustained by implementation of ongoing infrastructure projects and capacity expansion by firms
Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued amid spare capacity in the economy
Favourable labour market conditions in some countries continue to support consumption activity
Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to continue on a moderate recovery path
Inflation is expected to be at the lower end of the 2 to 3 range for 2016 and to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation
For Malaysia, latest indicators suggest that the domestic economy continued to register favourable performance in the first quarter
On the external front, the expected improvement in exports will provide some support to growth
Domestic investment activity will however continue, led by private sector capital spending and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects
For the emerging economies, while growth is slower, the economies continue to be the key contributor to global growth
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is projected to remain moderate amid stable demand conditions
Bank Negara Malaysias monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity
These factors will continue to underpin the growth momentum going into 2024
This trend is expected to be maintained in the fourth quarter
These investments, supported by higher capital imports, will raise exports and expand the productive capacity of the economy
Notwithstanding the heightened financial market volatility, the domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth
In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy
However, the recovery trajectory in some economies could be disrupted by a re-tightening of containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences
At this stage the risks are assessed to be about balanced, and consequently, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy
In Asia, growth is expected to be driven by domestic activity and stronger external demand
Investment activity would be supported by continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects, and implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.25 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively
The external sector is expected to record a modest improvement and provide additional support to the economy
These contractionary factors have been exacerbated by the protracted turmoil in the international financial markets
Going forward, the advanced economies are expected to register a slower pace of growth than earlier anticipated
While private consumption is expected to moderate, it will remain supported by the steady rise in income and employment, and the additional disposable income from the lower oil prices
Export performance also improved, reflecting firm regional demand and the normalisation of trade flows from supply chain disruptions
Under these conditions, sustaining domestic demand is key to ensuring that growth in 2009 remains positive
Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to manage risks of heightened volatility, including to provide liquidity, to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market
The global economy is expanding at a more moderate pace, with the slowdown becoming more synchronised across both the advanced and emerging economies
Domestic financial conditions also remain conducive to financial intermediation, with no signs of excessive tightening affecting consumption and investment activities
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR to 3.25 percent
In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to peak in the first quarter of 2016 and to moderate thereafter
Inflation in Malaysia has edged upwards but its level has remained low
However, this outlook continues to be highly dependent on the implementation of domestic policy on subsidies and price controls, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments
Further progress of multi-year infrastructure projects will support investment activity
However, at below two percent, the current inflation rate is among the lowest in the region
Headline inflation is projected to be higher in 2017, reflecting primarily the pass-through impact of the increase in global oil prices on domestic retail fuel prices
Going forward, the global growth outlook will continue to face headwinds from tighter financial conditions amid elevated inflation in major economies and the domestic challenges in China
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively
Headline inflation has averaged 3.4 for the period January-November 2022
Budget 2025 measures will provide additional support to growth
It also excludes the estimated direct impact of consumption tax policy changes
Headline inflation is expected to moderate in 2012
1This has been the practice since January 2010 following the coming into force of the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009
Risks to the global growth outlook arise mainly from political and policy uncertainties in the major economies, geopolitical and financial market developments, and volatility of commodity prices
These conditions have continued into the second quarter
The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable growth amid price stability
Overall, the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second-round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends
However, competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass-through to consumer prices
With the domestic growth on a firmer footing, the MPC decided to begin reducing the degree of monetary accommodation
These factors are likely to have a transitory effect and inflation is expected to moderate and remain manageable for the rest of the year
Investment activity would be supported by the ongoing progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans, as well as the higher realisation of investments
Global economic conditions have weakened significantly
While global headline and core inflation continued to edge downwards in recent months, the pace for disinflation has slowed in some advanced economies
The global economy continues to recover, although the growth performance differs markedly across the regions
Looking ahead, domestic demand will continue to be the key driver of growth, with an additional lift from exports as global growth improves
While inflation is expected to rise during the year, the expectation is for it to remain modest
Economic activity in the advanced and emerging economies has continued to improve
Regional economies have also recorded a sharp economic slowdown in the first quarter
Going forward, domestic demand will remain as a key driver of growth
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively
In North America, there have been tentative signs of improvements in the economy
While domestic demand in the emerging economies remains an important source of growth, the prolonged weakness in the external environment has begun to affect domestic economic activity in these economies
Moving forward, while the stance of monetary policy is expected to remain supportive of growth, the degree of monetary accommodation may be reviewed given the sustained growth in the economy and risks to inflation
Although the tightening in global financial conditions has eased somewhat, heightened policy uncertainties could lead to sharp financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook
Growing productivity and capacity expansions are also playing a role in mitigating inflationary pressures
The domestic economy has since improved significantly and is now on a path of recovery
Capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects will also support investment activity
Headline inflation moderated to 1.1 in July
Inflation has edged up, mainly on account of higher energy prices and other costs
The growth outlook is subject to downside risks from weaker-than-expected external demand and larger declines in commodity production
The current heightened financial market volatility and uncertainties also pose additional downside risks to global growth
The Statutory Reserve Requirement SRR is also reduced from 3.5 percent to 2 percent, effective from 1 February 2009
Global economic conditions remain weak with global growth projected to be negative for the year
The future stance of monetary policy would be determined by Bank Negara Malaysia s assessment of new data and information and their implications on the medium-term prospects for price stability and economic growth
Supply factors continue to be the key determinant affecting consumer prices with global commodity and energy prices projected to remain elevated
Consumer spending is expected to remain robust and private investment is expected to be sustained as companies upgrade and expand capacity to meet growing demand
Bank Negara Malaysias monetary operations have ensured that there is sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets
For the Malaysian economy, the latest indicators point towards sustained strength in economic activity in the second quarter of 2024, driven by resilient domestic expenditure and better export performance
The ringgit has continued to stabilise
While economic activity in the advanced economies has generally improved, growth in these economies is still expected to remain modest
Tourist arrivals are expected to continue rising, further lifting tourism-related activities
The Malaysian economy has been affected by these developments
Given the medium term outlook for inflation and economic growth, the current level of the policy rate remains appropriate
Nevertheless, in line with modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices are expected to be contained
Consequently, the downside risks to global growth have increased
While the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the lower earnings in the commodity sector are expected to have some impact on private consumption, household spending will continue to be supported by the steady increase in income and employment
Given the strength of the global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee may consider reviewing the current degree of monetary accommodation
In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to average within the projected range of between 2.0 and 3.0 for 2021, having averaged 2.3 year-to-date
Moving into 2023, headline and core inflation are expected to remain elevated amid both demand and cost pressures, as well as any changes to domestic policy measures
Growth was lifted by stronger domestic demand with additional impetus from exports
The Movement Control Order, while necessary to contain the spread of the virus, has also constrained production capacity and spending
External demand, however, was affected by the slower global growth
The deterioration in the world economy during the first quarter was worse than expected as the global financial turmoil became more prolonged
These include the prospect of further outbreaks of the pandemic leading to re-impositions of containment measures, more persistent weakness in labour market conditions, and a weaker-than-expected recovery in global growth
For Malaysia, economic activity contracted sharply in the second quarter of the year, due to measures introduced to contain the pandemic globally and domestically
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate OPR at 1.75 percent
The current stance of monetary policy remains supportive of growth
Nevertheless, the inflation outlook remains highly subject to the implementation of further domestic policy measures
The ringgit exchange rate is being affected by global factors that are affecting many emerging and commodity producing economies
The decline in prices largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices
Domestic headline inflation was 3.4 in September on account of the slower increase in the transport category
The recent announcements by the Government have provided more clarity on fiscal and economic development policies
In addition, fiscal and financial measures will continue to cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and provide support to economic activity
Private consumption will continue to be an important driver of growth, supported by sustained employment and income growth
Risks to the inflation outlook remain highly subject to the degree of persistence in core inflation, changes to domestic policy on subsidies and price controls, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments
The strength of the recovery remains varied across countries mainly corresponding to their vaccination coverage, relaxation of containment measures and degree of policy support
Investment activity would be supported by continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects, and implementation of catalytic initiatives under the recently announced national master plans
International financial markets have also become more volatile following increased concerns over developments in Europe and continued policy uncertainties in several major advanced countries
The current level of the policy rate remains consistent with the medium term outlook of relatively low and stable inflation and sustainable economic growth
The robust expansion in investment activity would be sustained by the progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans, as well as the higher realisation of approved investments
The economic recovery in the major advanced economies has remained modest
The global economy is expected to continue to experience slow growth
This growth prospect however, could be affected by the heightened external risks
As expected, headline inflation trended lower in recent months on account of moderating cost factors
This reflects the lapse in the impact of consumption tax policy changes, the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and policy measures in place to contain food prices
These developments point to sustained momentum in global growth
The current assessment is that the domestic economy is expected to improve in the second half of 2009, supported by stabilisation in global economic conditions and the larger impetus from the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures
The Malaysian economy had performed well in 2007 and continues to maintain a steady momentum
The global economic and financial conditions registered some improvements since the previous MPC meeting
In Asia, persistent weakness in the external sector has weighed on growth, although domestic demand remains supportive
However, the large and volatile shifts in global liquidity are leading to a build up of liquidity in the domestic financial system
Overall domestic financial conditions have remained relatively stable since the previous MPC meeting
Consequently, inflation is projected to be lower at 2  3 percent in 2016, compared to an earlier projection of 2.5  3.5 percent, and continue to remain stable in 2017
Domestic headline inflation moderated in September to 1.8
However, upside risks to inflation could emerge should supply disruptions result in higher global prices for commodities
While inflation may increase in 2013, it is expected to remain modest given the excess capacity in the economy
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent
This will be driven by the expansion in global demand and higher private sector expenditure amid improvements in the labour market and continued policy support
While the growth of private investment has moderated due to lower investment by the oil and gas industry and commodities sector, overall investment activity will remain supported by the implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors
However, the balance of risks to the outlook has tilted to the downside
These risks could also reignite financial market volatility
In the Malaysian economy, while the external sector is affected by global developments, domestic demand has continued to provide support to growth
The growth momentum is expected to be sustained into the fourth quarter
Meanwhile, most emerging economies, particularly in Asia, continue to be affected by significant shifts in global liquidity, which have increased the risks to macroeconomic and financial stability
For most central banks, the monetary policy stance is likely to remain tight
In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid a slowdown in trade activity
The major advanced economies are experiencing a deepening economic contraction, while the regional economies are experiencing a rapid slowdown
The future thrust of monetary policy would depend on new information and our assessment of the change in the balance of risks to the medium term outlook for inflation and growth
In addition, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and current account surplus of the balance of payments
Domestic demand would be sustained by the private sector as the public sector consolidates its fiscal position
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2017
For the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid the continued moderation in external demand
Of significance, Malaysia is entering this challenging period from a position of strength given the diversified sources of growth of the economy, low unemployment level, manageable level of external indebtedness, and a well-capitalised banking system
Going forward, while recent trends suggest a turnaround in exports, the contribution of the external sector to overall growth is expected to be modest
The impact of domestic demand factors on inflation is expected to be contained, in line with stable domestic demand conditions
Despite the slowing investment activity in the oil and gas industry, investment is being supported by infrastructure development projects and capital spending by the manufacturing and services sectors
High food price inflation, largely due to supply disruptions, continues to remain a concern
The financial system remains sound with financial institutions operating with ample liquidity buffers
Economic activity in major advanced economies has improved but remains moderate
The strength of domestic demand is expected to sustain growth going into 2008
Latest economic data suggests that the recovery is uneven while downside risks to global growth prospects remain
Private consumption will be supported by income growth and stable employment conditions while investment will be led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas industry and the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent
The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from further escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and volatility in global financial markets
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth
The cumulative 125 basis points reduction in the OPR this year will continue to provide stimulus to the economy
Global and regional growth is expected to remain favourable in 2007
Importantly, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and surplus in the current account of the balance of payments
Further measures will be introduced by the Bank to ensure continuous access to credit as well as to minimise the impact of the economic downturn on specific affected groups
In the advanced economies, growth has slowed by more than expected following continued weakness in the labour market and the fading impact of the temporary boost to economic activity provided by the inventory build up and the policy stimulus
The implementation of financial market development measures has provided stability to the domestic foreign exchange market
These growth prospects are underpinned by strengthened domestic demand and a supportive external environment
In particular, regional economies expanded strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the growth momentum is expected to be sustained
While core inflation in advanced economies is slowing down, it remains above historical averages
Nevertheless, the expectation is for underlying inflation to remain relatively stable, amid the more moderate demand conditions
Going into 2022, the growth momentum is expected to improve, supported by expansion in global demand, higher private sector expenditure in line with the resumption of economic activity and continued policy support
Headline inflation increased to 4.3 in the first quarter of the year, in line with the MPCs expectations
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity and exports
In addition, the lower international oil prices and moderating inflation in our trade partner economies are also expected to contribute to an environment of more stable domestic consumer prices
Such risks may arise from a weaker-than-expected global growth, a worsening in supply chain disruptions, and the emergence of severe and vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants of concern
Economic activity in the advanced economies has shown broader signs of stabilisation, supported by the impact of policy measures implemented and an improvement in consumer sentiment and business confidence
While further upward price adjustments may occur, overall inflation is still expected to be contained
Global growth remains weighed down by persistently elevated inflation and higher interest rates, with several major economies experiencing slowing growth momentum
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, an escalation of geopolitical tensions, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions
Leading indicators, however, point to a softening of the near term global economic outlook, with considerable downside risks remaining primarily from prolonged trade tensions
Going forward and continuing into 2019, headline inflation is expected to edge upwards taking into consideration the impact of policy measures on domestic cost factors
Global growth has moderated in the recent months as growth in the advanced economies slowed by more than expected following the greater policy uncertainties, worsening of confidence and heightened financial market volatilities, amidst continued weaknesses in labour market conditions
Going forward, inflation is expected to be affected by higher domestic costs
The assessment is therefore that inflation is expected to moderate substantially in the second-half of 2009
Downside risks to the global outlook remain, especially if a resurgence of the pandemic necessitates the reintroduction of containment measures
For the region, growth is expected to be sustained by robust domestic demand, increased investment activity and intra-regional trade
Economic activity in the advanced economies is being weighed down by heightened market volatility and lower confidence, amid rising policy uncertainties
Going forward, the more favourable global growth prospects will lead to sustained export performance and generate positive spillovers to the domestic economy
After incorporating the potential impact of subsidy rationalisation, headline and core inflation are projected to average between 2.0 - 3.5 and 2.0 - 3.0 for the year respectively
With more businesses allowed to operate under the Conditional Movement Control Order, economic activity is projected to gradually improve
The global economy continues to experience slow growth
Global trade is also affected by rotation of spending from goods to services, and the ongoing electrical and electronics EE downcycle
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators show that economic activity strengthened further in the third quarter, driven primarily by robust domestic demand
The continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects will support investment activity
The baseline projection remains within the range of 4.3 - 4.8
These developments may increase the risk to the outlook for inflation
Looking ahead, private consumption will be supported by the income growth and stable employment conditions
The robust economic growth was supported by stronger expansion in private sector demand, both consumption and investment demand, and more buoyant export growth arising from sustained expansion in global economic activity
Although private consumption is expected to moderate as households adjust to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax GST, consumption expenditure will be supported by the steady rise in incomes and employment
Looking ahead, the narrowing interest rate differentials between Malaysia and the advanced economies is positive for the ringgit
In the major advanced economies, broader signs of improvement have emerged
Despite the increased volatility in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, these developments are not expected to derail Malaysias growth
Looking ahead, this trend is expected to continue
For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher given the impact of the implementation of the GST
At the current level, the monetary policy stance is slightly accommodative and remains supportive of the economy
The sustained expansion in domestic aggregate demand is expected to continue to be reinforced by strong performance of the export sector
Headline inflation is expected to moderate in 2012 with improved domestic supply and stable demand conditions
The risks of a broad-based and persistent decline in prices are assessed to be limited as economic activity resumes and demand conditions improve
This is likely to lead to slower global growth in the months ahead
An increasing number of indicators now signal an easing of inflationary pressures
The increase in inflation, however, is from a low level and will be mitigated by a stable external price environment, expansion in domestic capacity and moderate domestic demand pressures
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR to 2.75 percent
Headline inflation, therefore, is expected to moderate in 2012
For the Malaysian economy, better-than-expected economic activity in the first quarter of 2021 continued into April, as reflected by latest indicators, particularly on exports, retail spending and labour market conditions
Downside risks to this outlook, however, continue to persist
In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to temporarily spike in the second quarter of 2021, due particularly to the lower base from the low domestic retail fuel prices in the corresponding quarter of 2020
Overall growth continues to be underpinned by domestic demand
While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the recovery has been modest and uneven
The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting1
Investment activity is projected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors
Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures
On the external front, Malaysias diversified exports will partly mitigate the impact of softening global demand
At its Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, the MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate OPR at 3.25 percent
For Malaysia, economic activity weakened in the third quarter, amid the imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases
The Malaysian economy expanded strongly by 8.7 in 2022 driven by the recovery in private and public sector spending following the full reopening of the economy
The global economic recovery has strengthened further, supported by improvements in manufacturing and services activity
Investment will be sustained by infrastructure projects and higher capital investment in the manufacturing and services sectors
The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity
Trade tensions have also risen in the recent period
While the re-imposition of containment measures will affect growth in the first quarter, the impact is expected to be less severe than that experienced in the second quarter of 2020
At the current OPR level, the monetary policy stance is slightly accommodative and remains supportive of the economy
There are further signs of recovery in the electrical and electronics EE sector, but global trade remains soft partly due to the continued shift in spending from goods to services, and ongoing trade restrictions
The assessment is that with the current low interest rates and with the fiscal stimulus gaining traction, the prevailing policy measures are sufficient to provide support to economic activity
The current stance of monetary policy will therefore be maintained to support growth
In the advanced economies, growth will remain underpinned by strong labour market conditions and policy support
While the advanced economies continue to register modest growth, most emerging economies have experienced strong growth
The global economy continues to expand
Global growth moderated in the first quarter with several key economies affected by weather-related and policy-induced factors
The impact of these measures will however take some time to be fully realised
While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there is ample liquidity in the domestic financial system and there has been normal functioning of the financial markets
The strength of the recovery in the major advanced economies has yet to gain momentum
This is consistent with the MPCs view that the unprecedented conditions that necessitated a historically low OPR have continued to recede
This deceleration is expected to continue with the weaker demand conditions and lower imported inflation
At this current level of the OPR, the MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate in sustaining economic growth with price stability
Overall, the economy is expected to register higher growth in 2017
Pressures from global commodity prices are also likely to be contained given the moderate global growth prospects
However, there are downside risks to growth from heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors
The performance of the Malaysian economy in the first-half of 2008 has been driven by robust domestic demand and reinforced by favourable export performance
In most of Asia, growth has been sustained by the continued expansion in domestic demand
Sustained employment conditions and income growth is expected to provide support to private consumption, while private investment is projected to strengthen amidst the improved investment environment
Going forward, the global economic and the international financial conditions are expected to continue to remain volatile and uncertain
Going forward, the overall growth momentum is expected to be sustained
This will complement the robust growth in both domestic consumption and investment that is expected to be sustained for the rest of the year
In the MPCs assessment, there continues to be considerable uncertainties in the global economic and financial environment
The expectations of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment in the US, and increased concerns over the escalation of geopolitical tensions have contributed to a persistently strong US dollar
However, the pace of recovery will be uneven across sectors, with economic activity in some industries remaining below pre-pandemic levels, and a slower improvement in the labour market
Private consumption will be supported by favourable income and labour market conditions
Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy going forward will be determined by new data and information, and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth
In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to average negative this year given the substantially lower global oil prices
Monetary policy easing in several major economies has eased global financial conditions, but uncertainty from the prolonged trade disputes and geopolitical developments could lead to excessive financial market volatility
The Monetary Policy Statement will be released at 6 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting
Financial conditions also remain supportive of growth
The baseline projection is for the Malaysian economy to grow within the projected range of 4.3 - 4.8
Investment activity, although moderating, will be supported by on-going infrastructure investments and capital expenditure in the manufacturing and services sectors
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2016
The overnight policy rate OPR will remain unchanged at its current level of 2.70
The current assessment is that the accumulated monetary policy initiatives and measures to enhance access to financing are sufficient to provide support to domestic demand
For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher, but to be below its historical average
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity
Economies with better progress in their vaccination programmes have eased containment measures, enabling a continued recovery in domestic activity
The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting
After evaluating the evidence on the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy
While the downside risks to global growth have increased significantly, concerns about inflation have subsided as commodity and energy prices declined, and as slower growth sets in
For the Malaysian economy, the latest indicators point towards sustained strength in economic activity driven by resilient domestic expenditure and higher export activity
In this environment, international financial markets have remained relatively stable
On the external front, exports are projected to provide an additional lift to growth, albeit to a lesser extent, due to moderating global growth momentum
Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued and within expectations
Continued employment and wage growth, as well as policy measures, will continue to support household spending
For Malaysia, economic activity has been supported by the continued growth in domestic demand and exports
Going forward, the expectation remains that the domestic economy will improve in the second half of 2009 and into 2010, following a recovery in domestic demand amidst stabilisation of the global economy
Nevertheless, the global economy continues to be weighed down by elevated cost pressures and higher interest rates
Overall, the balance of risks to the global growth outlook remains tilted to the downside
Private consumption will remain the largest driver of growth, supported by continued improvements in income and overall labour market conditions
Private consumption will be underpinned by continued wage and employment growth, with an additional lift from higher household spending due to the tax holiday
While a number of economies have put in place stimulus measures to manage the downturn, their impact on the economy has yet to take effect
Average headline inflation in 2019 will be low
Global growth, however, remains weighed down by persistently elevated core inflation and higher interest rates
In Asia, the better external environment is supporting growth amid continued expansion in domestic demand
The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose by 1 in the first four months of 2004
Meanwhile, global price pressures have been increasing, due largely to high global energy, food and commodity prices
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point to further improvement in exports and continued expansion in private sector investment spending
Nevertheless, upside risks to inflation could emerge arising from the risk of supply disruptions and the possible financialisation in commodity markets, which would result in higher energy and commodity prices
While core inflation has also moderated, it remains elevated relative to the long-term average amid lingering demand and cost factors
Looking ahead, the strong growth momentum is expected to continue in 2018, sustained by the stronger global growth and positive spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy
Commodity and food prices have continued their upward trend, and this is contributing to higher global inflation
Headline inflation is projected to average between 2.2 - 3.2 in 2022
Going forward, downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions
In this environment, global inflation has begun to recede and this downward trend is expected to continue
Meanwhile, upside risks to growth mainly emanate from greater spillover from the tech upcycle, more robust tourism activity and faster implementation of existing and new projects
There are early signs of improvement in Chinas growth, though its property market remained weak
The global economic expansion continues, although with signs of moderating momentum
Risks to the global growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, with trade tensions continuing to be a key source of downside risk
Volatility in the international financial markets has also risen
However, the projected trajectory of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on the future trend in global oil prices which remains highly uncertain
Going forward, global growth will remain highly uneven across regions, with increased downside risks
For Malaysia, the latest high-frequency indicators show that economic activity rebounded in the fourth quarter, in line with the relaxation of containment measures
Downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, higher risk aversion in global financial markets amid more aggressive monetary policy tightening in major economies, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions
In this environment, however, domestic liquidity continues to be sufficient and the financial system remains sound with healthy growth in financing
The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be accommodative and supportive of the economy
Domestic financial markets have remained resilient despite non-resident portfolio outflows
While the monthly headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility in global oil prices, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions
Going forward, exports are expected to be further lifted by the global tech upcycle given Malaysias position in the semiconductor supply chain, as well as continued strength in non-EE goods
The reduction in the OPR provides additional policy stimulus to accelerate the pace of economic recovery
In 2019, inflation is expected to average moderately higher
Looking forward, inflation in 2024 is expected to remain moderate, broadly reflecting stable demand conditions and contained cost pressures
Tightening financial conditions and heightened volatility in financial markets, coupled with country-specific factors ranging from heightened political and policy uncertainty and elevated debt levels, could further weigh on growth prospects
The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and remains highly subject to any changes to domestic policy on subsidies and price controls, as well as global commodity price developments
The international economic and financial environment has deteriorated sharply in the recent quarter
Of note, the Governments intention to review price controls and subsidies in 2024 will affect the outlook for inflation and demand conditions
These developments have raised uncertainties on the potential impact on the international financial system and the global economic activity
Considerable uncertainties remain due to heightened concerns over the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the expected diminishing effects of fiscal policy support
While the prospects of monetary easing in the major economies have somewhat eased global financial conditions, heightened policy uncertainty could lead to excessive financial market volatility
The financial system continues to be sound, with improved liquidity in the domestic financial system, continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets, and financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers
The broad appreciation of the ringgit in the past year better reflects the economic fundamentals
As expected, both headline and core inflation continued to moderate in the fourth quarter, mainly due to lower cost pressures amid stabilising demand conditions
With the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for fuel, the outlook for headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility of oil prices
Consequently, headline inflation increased to 4.3 in September, arising from higher global prices of refined oil caused by disruptions in the global supply
Global growth is projected to experience a faster expansion in 2018
While domestic financial conditions remain orderly, greater vigilance will be accorded to the potential risks arising from large and volatile capital flows
Inflation declined further in July
Moving forward, growth is expected to improve in 2024, driven by the recovery in exports and resilient domestic expenditure
Growth in the global economy has moderated in the third quarter, with a sustained divergence in the growth performance of the advanced and emerging economies
The MPC will continue to evaluate the global and domestic economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy
Inflationary conditions have remained, mainly on account of higher energy prices and rising costs
Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, the OPR was reduced by a cumulative 125 basis points to a historic low of 1.75 to provide support to the economy
Going forward, inflation is expected to remain stable for the rest of the year and moderate in 2012
The growth momentum is expected to be sustained in 2017
Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged 2.4
Given the outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative
This has also led to greater risk aversion, resulting in tighter financial conditions and a resurgence in financial market volatility
For Malaysia, the latest data indicated continued economic expansion in the final quarter of last year on account of resilient domestic demand
Malaysias economic growth is expected to gain momentum in 2006, with the risk of inflation still remaining
The demand for financing by businesses and consumers remains strong, with robust investment activity as corporations expand capacity, and steady consumption growth also being supported by a stable employment environment and growth in incomes
Private consumption will be underpinned by higher wages and employment
With additional impetus from the external sector, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018
Inflation for 2015 is expected to be lower than earlier anticipated due to the lower energy and commodity prices
In Asia, economic activity has been supported by domestic demand amid weaker export growth
Domestic supply and cost factors are expected to contribute to higher prices
Domestic headline inflation averaged 3.2 in 2011
Nevertheless, these developments are not expected to derail Malaysias growth prospects
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, including an escalation of geopolitical tensions, weaker-than-expected growth outturns in major economies, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions
On the external front, exports are expected to expand but will be constrained by soft demand from Malaysias key trading partners
In most of Asia, domestic demand continues to support growth despite weaker exports
Global trade recovery is expected to continue, supported by both electrical and electronics EE as well as non-EE products
This stabilisation in the external environment is also supported by the accelerated implementation of fiscal measures, the further moderation in inflation and continued access to financing, thereby increasing the prospects for a resumption of growth in the Malaysian economy
The increase was mainly due to higher food and fuel prices
Overall, inflation is, however, expected to remain moderate going into 2011
These actions are contributing to greater inflows, lending support to a firmer ringgit
While this has raised the risk of an economic contraction in 2009, the prospects remain intact for an economic recovery once global conditions stabilise given that the economy is not overleveraged, the financial system remains sound, and the external position is healthy
Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers, with domestic financial conditions remaining conducive to sustain credit growth
At this point, risks to the global growth outlook remain balanced, pointing towards continuity in global economic expansion
However, downside risks remain due to geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainties in a number of countries
The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments, arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions, as well as domestic policy measures
Economies making better progress in their vaccination programmes have been able to ease containment measures, enabling a swift recovery in domestic activity
The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across countries
However, greater uncertainties in the credit markets and weaker demand conditions in some of the large industrial economies have heightened the risk of slower global growth and its potential implications on the domestic economy
The global economy continues to be confronted with some uncertainties
However, the slower global growth may have a moderating effect on global prices and thereby reduce the cost pressures being felt by the domestic economy
Investment activity is projected to be supported by capacity expansion mainly in the export-oriented industries and ongoing infrastructure projects, particularly in the transport and utilities sub-sectors
A number of mitigating factors, including capacity expansion, would however moderate the impact on domestic inflation in 2008
Amid the prevailing uncertainties, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and their implications on the overall outlook for domestic inflation and growth
Headline inflation for 2016 is expected to be at the lower end of the projected range of 2.0  2.5
While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2018
While private investment is projected to remain modest, household spending will be supported by continued employment and wage growth
With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to normalise the degree of monetary accommodation
The current assessment of the balance of risks to the growth and inflation prospects does not prompt a change to the present stance of monetary policy, which remains supportive of growth
Headline inflation averaged at 3.7 in 2017
Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity
It is, however, recognised that the downside risks to growth remain high
The stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth
Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions
Global headline inflation edged up partly due to higher commodity prices, while core inflation continued to moderate
Tourist arrivals and spending are also poised to rise further
In the domestic economy, recent data and surveys of business conditions suggest that consumption and investment activity remains resilient
Overall domestic financial conditions have remained stable
Headline inflation in 2022 is projected to remain moderate as the base effect from fuel inflation continues to dissipate
Inflationary pressures are expected to be muted in 2020
In several advanced economies, sizeable fiscal and monetary measures are also supporting a stronger recovery momentum, although activities in some economies are disrupted by tighter containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences
While cost-push inflation continues to remain, the pace of increase is expected to be more gradual
Headline inflation is likely to average negative in 2020 given the substantially lower global oil prices, and average higher in 2021, within the earlier projected ranges
Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions, spending on new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors
Following the adjustment of the interest rate, the level of the OPR continues to be below its neutral level and therefore, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of the economy
Looking ahead, growth prospects will be sustained by the positive global growth outlook and spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy
The reopening of international borders will lift tourism-related sectors
Slowing growth itself will contribute to containing the potential for second round effects on inflation, thereby containing further increases in prices in the second-half of 2009
Underlying inflation is expected to be more moderate, amid limited demand pressures despite the continued expansion in economic activity
Since the MPC in August, the international economic and financial conditions have improved further
These factors include the weaker commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets
Volatility in the international financial markets has receded, but markets will continue to be affected by shifts in global liquidity and investor sentiments
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions
Nevertheless, the downside risk to the global economic outlook has increased following the weakening growth momentum in a number of major economies due to external and domestic specific factors
The uncertainties in the policy environment are also contributing to the shift in sentiments in the international financial markets
For Malaysia, the latest indicators point towards significant improvement in economic activity in the third quarter
Household spending will be underpinned by sustained improvements in employment and income prospects
While global financial markets have broadly improved, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments
Domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner
Headline inflation in 2021 is projected to average higher between 2.5 and 4.0, primarily due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices
The stance of monetary policy continues to remain supportive of economic activity
Growth in the major advanced economies continues to be constrained by ongoing fiscal consolidation, slow recovery in financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions
Uncertainties in the global environment may also affect the overall growth momentum
The unprecedented conditions that necessitated such actions have since abated
The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to remain firmly on a steady growth path
The assessment is that inflation will continue to be driven by supply factors with limited evidence of excess demand exerting pressure on prices
The outcome of the US elections could heighten volatility in the near term
With the decision today, the OPR has been reduced by a total of 100 basis points, complementing other monetary and financial measures by Bank Negara Malaysia as well as fiscal measures this year
Moving into 2018, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors
Both headline and core inflation averaged 1.8 in the first half of 2024
In Asia, growth is supported by sustained domestic demand and a gradual recovery in external demand
In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand
These cost factors are not expected to cause significant spillovers to the broader price trends, given the stable domestic demand conditions
The international economic and financial conditions have deteriorated much more significantly in the recent period
The overnight policy rate will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70
The pace and strength of the recovery, however, remain subject to downside risks emanating from both domestic and external factors
In 2005, the economy is still expected to grow at close to its potential despite a more challenging international environment
Private consumption will be supported by growth in income and employment, and measures implemented by the Government
In the advanced economies, growth has been modest and uneven
The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively
In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to ongoing global developments
External factors, namely shifting expectations of major economies monetary policy paths and ongoing geopolitical tensions, have led to heightened volatility in both capital flows and exchange rates across the region, including the ringgit
In Asia, growth continues to be supported by domestic demand and a gradual improvement in intra-regional trade
Going forward, the growth momentum is expected to continue in 2014, amid better performance in the external sector
While households are expected to continue adjusting to the GST in the immediate future, overall spending will be supported by continued wage growth and stable labour market conditions
While headline inflation has remained low in the recent period, it is projected to rise in the coming months as the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy lapses
While these positive developments are expected to continue going into 2010, the recovery is likely to be gradual and uneven, with the outlook remaining uncertain once the effects of the policy support begin to diminish
However, the absence of external price pressures and more moderate demand conditions are expected to mitigate the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation
Tighter global financial conditions and elevated political and policy uncertainty could lead to financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook
This is also supported by the favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer and business sentiments, low inflation and conducive credit conditions
Household spending continues to be supported by stable employment conditions and income growth
The global economy continues to improve at a moderate pace
Domestic headline inflation has increased to 2.4 in January 2011
Tourist arrivals have continued to rise, further lifting the tourism-related sectors
The recovery of the global economy is continuing, although the growth performance differs markedly across regions
Going forward, growth will remain anchored by domestic demand with additional support from the improved external environment
Prices are expected to rise at a gradual pace in the coming months, in line with the continued improvement in domestic economic conditions, and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices
Headline inflation is projected to peak in 3Q 2022 before moderating thereafter, due to dissipating base effects and in line with the expected easing of global commodity prices
Recent adjustments in the financial markets, though short-lived, indicate that volatility may reemerge
In this environment, the Asian economies are benefiting from stronger external demand amid sustained domestic activity
As projected, headline inflation peaked in 3Q 2022, while underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, has averaged 2.9 up to November 2022
Further normalisation to the degree of monetary policy accommodation would be informed by the evolving conditions and their implications to the domestic inflation and growth outlook
This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices
With some excess capacity in the economy, the strength of domestic demand is not expected to result in inflationary conditions
Both macro and micro prudential measures as well as supervisory oversight have resulted in more prudent lending standards and contained speculative activities in the property market
Looking ahead, the recovery in global growth performance has, however, become vulnerable to increased downside risks
Investment activity and private consumption have remained firm
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by robust domestic demand
However, the recovery in the services sector has been slower
Global energy and food prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year from their already high levels
Prices are expected to increase at a modest pace in the coming months, driven primarily by rising global commodity and food prices
Growth prospects should improve in 2021 with the expected containment of the pandemic
Looking ahead, the weaker external environment could, however, impact the overall growth prospects
In the major advanced economies, recovery remains gradual and uneven
The advanced economies continue to record modest growth
The degree of impact to the economy is highly dependent on the stringency and duration of containment measures
There are strong upside risks to global inflation due to sustained high food and energy prices
The sharp slowdown in global demand, the significant fall in commodity prices and the substantial decline in equity prices have exerted greater downward pressure on the growth prospects of regional economies
Improvements in exports have supported economic growth during the quarter while domestic demand remained firm
Looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by sustained private sector economic activity and further reinforced by public sector spending
Inflation continued to decline at a slower rate in October
Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support to growth
Overall, the economy is projected to expand within expectations in 2016, and to remain on a steady growth path in 2017
In emerging economies, while domestic demand remains an important source of growth, exports are affected by weak external demand
These positive developments are expected to continue into 2010, with growth in the domestic economy expected to continue to be supported by existing policy measures and the growing confidence in the private sector
Global trade has picked up significantly
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation1, remained stable at 1.6 in March 2019
Inflation is expected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors
The annual average headline inflation will be low in 2018
Headline and core inflation remain modest, averaging 1.8 year-to-date
Recent external and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets
Global growth, however, remains weighed down by persistent core inflation and higher interest rates
Inflation has been gradually rising due to disruptions in supply following adverse weather conditions and higher domestic costs
Headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year mainly reflecting the waning effect of global cost factors
The global economic recovery has continued in the first quarter of the year, but the growth has been highly uneven across regions
Despite the challenging environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 3.1 in 2021
Growth has become more entrenched and synchronised across regions
The latest indicators point towards sustained strength in economic activity driven by resilient domestic expenditure and higher export activity
Global growth prospects have also become more susceptible to increased downside risks in light of possible repercussions from the EU referendum in the United Kingdom
Looking ahead, inflation is expected to edge up driven by domestic cost factors
Sizeable fiscal and monetary stimulus in several major economies continue to support the recovery momentum
Inflation is expected to turn positive in the coming months, as domestic economic conditions strengthen
Investment activity is projected to be underpinned by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, particularly in the export-oriented industries, driven by favourable demand and efforts to enhance automation
In the domestic economy, a broad set of indicators suggests robust expansion in the fourth quarter of 2012
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from a slower momentum in major economies, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, an escalation of geopolitical tensions, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions
In October, the inflation rate eased further to 3.1
Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom
The MPC will also remain vigilant to the risks of destabilising financial imbalances
The outlook for growth continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly with respect to developments surrounding the pandemic
Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices
Private consumption will continue to be underpinned by stable employment and wage growth, while private investment will be supported by on-going multi-year projects in both export- and domestic-oriented industries
These factors more than offset the support from positive labour market conditions, and the full reopening of economies and international borders
Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued given the projections of weaker domestic growth prospects and labour market conditions
Nevertheless, greater weakness in the external environment is expected to affect regional growth prospects
Inflationary expectations are also well-contained
The current elevated inflation rate reflects the effects of the fuel and other administered price adjustments made earlier this year
Risks to the growth outlook have abated slightly, but remain tilted to the downside, primarily due to uncertainty over the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and effectiveness of the vaccination programmes
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, remains moderate
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent
For the Malaysian economy, the fourth quarter advance estimates for GDP affirmed that the overall growth for 2023 expanded within expectations
The MPC will continue to carefully assess the external developments and their implications on the Malaysian economy
However, in line with the relaxation of restrictions, latest high frequency indicators show that economic activity has recovered from the trough in July
For Malaysia, domestic demand continues to be the main driver of growth
In Asia, the better external environment provides further support to growth amid continued expansion in domestic demand
Domestic headline inflation has continued to increase, rising to 3 in March to average 2.8 for the first quarter of 2011
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2015
While the recent re-imposition of containment measures in select locations will affect economic activity in the short term, the impact will be less severe as almost all economic sectors are allowed to operate
Nonetheless, growth for the year 2020 is expected to be within the earlier forecasted range
Malaysias economic fundamentals are strongly anchored
In particular, continued aggressive adjustments in US interest rates and expectations of a higher terminal rate in the US, have contributed to a persistently strong US dollar environment
While domestic conditions remain favourable, uncertainties have emerged in the external environment arising from sustained high energy prices, geopolitical risks and possible moderation of global growth
The extent of upward pressures to inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls, fuel subsidies, and the prevailing spare capacity in the economy
A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs
Private investment is also projected to strengthen, underpinned by the improving outlook for the domestic economy and further expansion of new growth industries
Average headline inflation is likely to be negative this year, primarily reflecting the substantially lower global oil prices
The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings
Household and capital spending will continue to be driven by stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors such as manufacturing and services
In the recent months, global economic and financial conditions have deteriorated following the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the significant policy uncertainties
The various policy support packages will alleviate some of the financial burdens of households and businesses
Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, financial market volatility has increased substantially in the recent period as markets reassessed the direction of policy
Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged at 2.8
On balance, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand being the key driver of growth
The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter
The transition to endemicity on 1 April 2022 would strengthen economic activity, in line with further easing of restrictions and the reopening of international borders
International financial markets could also be subject to greater volatility going forward
Greater volatility in the international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from further escalation of geopolitical tensions, heightened volatility in global financial markets and slower growth momentum in major economies
Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, supported by improving incomes and overall labour market conditions, new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors
The Malaysian economy continued to expand in the first half of 2018, supported by private sector activity with additional impetus from net exports
However, there is now clearer evidence of the slowing growth in the major economies
As in the previous month, the decline largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008, and the easing pressure on food prices
In the Asian region, sustained domestic demand is projected to continue to support economic growth
Demand driven inflation remains contained
Global trade is expected to strengthen as the global tech upcycle gains momentum
The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments amid risks from prolonged supply-related disruptions
Despite the recent moderation in economic activity due to the Omicron-driven COVID-19 resurgences, the overall recovery trajectory remains on track
The expedited roll-out of mass vaccination programmes, together with ongoing policy support, are expected to lift global growth prospects going forward
The impact of the rapid decline in global demand on trade, production and investment activities in the Asian region has intensified
However, headline inflation is expected to remain low
For 2016, headline inflation is expected to be higher, to peak in the first quarter and moderating thereafter
Stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending
Tourist arrivals and spending are expected to improve further
Despite the signs of slowing global growth, commodity and food prices have continued to increase
Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, heightened volatility of financial markets and negative developments in the prices of key commodities
The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path
While growth has slowed in most of Asia, the region continues to record positive growth that is being supported by domestic demand
The growth has been supported by continued expansion in domestic private demand as well as robust external demand for Malaysia s exports
The downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased significantly
Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013
Given this improved economic outlook, the MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards normalising monetary conditions and preventing the risk of financial imbalances that could undermine the economic recovery process
For 2017 as a whole, headline inflation is expected to be at the upper end of the forecast range
Looking ahead, while the external sector performance is likely to be weighed down by slower global growth and trade tensions, economic growth will be supported by domestic demand
Food price inflation has, however, continued to increase
The ringgit exchange rate will reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede
Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018, but at a more moderate pace relative to the previous year
Economic activity in most major advanced economies is slower amid greater policy uncertainty while conditions in the international financial markets continue to be volatile
Inflation remains elevated in a number of countries, driven by both supply and demand factors
Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth
Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012
Downside risks to growth have increased following greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts
The Malaysian economy has performed well during the first half of 2006, sustained by robust domestic demand and strong global economic growth
The global economy continues to expand albeit moderately, supported by domestic demand amid improvement in trade activity
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5 and 1.5 for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy
The cost-driven inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions
Private consumption will be underpinned by stable income growth and favourable labour market conditions
In the advanced economies, the broad-based increase in investment amid the steady growth in consumption is raising growth prospects
The MPC will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth
Going forward, economic activity is expected to improve with domestic demand remaining the key driver of growth
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2014
Average headline inflation year-to-date is 0.3
While the growth outlook is subject to downside risks stemming from weaker-than-expected external demand and larger and protracted declines in commodity production, upside risks mainly emanate from stronger-than-expected tourism activity, a stronger recovery from the EE downcycle, and faster implementation of existing and new projects
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments, and will continue to monitor incoming data to inform the assessment on the outlook of domestic inflation and growth
In the region, while growth has moderated amid weaker external demand, domestic activity remains robust
Moving forward, the more challenging external environment has, however, increased the downside risks to the domestic economy
The growth of the Malaysian economy in the first quarter was within expectations
While the Malaysian economy is affected by these global developments, domestic demand has continued to support economic growth
While the macro and micro prudential measures have had a moderating impact on the growth of household indebtedness, the current monetary and financial conditions could lead to a broader build up in economic and financial imbalances
The ringgit is currently undervalued, given Malaysias economic fundamentals and growth prospects
Given that the Malaysian banking system remains fundamentally sound, the Banks efforts will continue to be directed towards ensuring access to credit to all sectors of the economy, and that the reduction in interest rates would be reflected in lower borrowing costs
Looking ahead, global growth will be supported by the emerging economies and the recovery in the advanced economies
At the same time, the MPC will also continue to monitor for risks of destabilising financial imbalances
The MPC will continue to assess the impact of the cumulative OPR adjustments, given the lag effects of monetary policy on the economy
Upside risk to inflation would be dependent on the extent of spillover effects of domestic policy measures, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments
Prices will gradually increase during the year, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices
Investment activity and prospects continue to be supported by the realisation of multi-year projects
The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and remains highly subject to any changes to domestic policy including on subsidies and price controls, financial market developments, as well as global commodity prices
Given these developments, the assessment going forward is for the global recovery to proceed at a more moderate pace
While these external developments may result in a moderation in the pace of growth of the Malaysian economy, moving forward, the overall growth will continue to be supported by the robust domestic economic activity
The export sector is expected to continue to support growth in an environment of greater resilience of the world economy to higher oil prices and amidst expectations for a moderation in global demand for IT products
Overall investment activity is expected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors
Looking ahead, global growth is expected to be sustained by positive labour market conditions, moderating inflation and less restrictive monetary policy
For Malaysia, the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the introduction of targeted containment measures has affected the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter of 2020
Looking ahead, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand remaining as the key driver of growth
Heightened market volatility, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh down on growth in the advanced economies
Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs
At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains supportive of the economy
The large decline in external demand has already led to a contraction in exports and a moderation in the pace of private investment activity
Investment activity is mainly led by the domestic-oriented industries, the commodity sector and the public sector
Nevertheless, global economic and financial conditions remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiments and heightened volatility in the international financial markets
The risks to the Malaysian economy are primarily from the external sector
For the Malaysian economy, the re-imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases had dampened the growth momentum
The change largely reflects the lapse of the impact from the adjustment to retail fuel prices in 2008
At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent
Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with support from various policy measures to raise disposable income
The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum
Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, market uncertainties on the direction of policy have resulted in substantial volatility in global financial markets
For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020
The economic impact from the recent increase in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant is expected to be considerably less severe than previous waves in the absence of stringent restrictions
The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments and policy measures to alleviate the cost burden of the public
The global recovery has continued in the second quarter, supported by robust and broad-based growth in most emerging economies, in particular Asia , and a moderate recovery in the advanced economies
The global economic expansion remains moderate
The projected improvement in the domestic economy is expected to be further supported by a gradual recovery in global growth conditions
While this will pose a risk to the Malaysian growth outlook, the strength of domestic fundamentals will have a mitigating role in reducing the impact
Labour market conditions have also improved in many countries
Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by conducive labour market conditions
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively
The contraction in global demand and trade, combined with the reduction in global commodity prices, has affected the export earnings of many of the regional economies, including Malaysia
Global headline and core inflation edged downwards in recent months but continue to be above average
Going forward, domestic demand will still remain the key driver of growth
Upside risks to inflation could however emerge in the event of supply disruptions that results in higher global prices for commodities
While the moderating trends will affect the overall growth prospect, the Malaysian economy is still projected to remain on a steady growth path
For 2016, inflation is expected to be higher compared to 2015, given the adjustments in administered prices and the weaker ringgit exchange rate
For the Malaysian economy, latest developments point towards further expansion in economic activity in the first quarter of 2023 after the strong performance in 2022
Consumer spending is expected to remain robust and private investment is expected to be sustained as companies expand capacity
In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market
For Malaysia, the strong growth performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be anchored by private sector spending
Liquidity remains ample, augmented by liquidity injections by Bank Negara Malaysia
Going forward, the economy is expected to expand further in 2010, with growth being supported by strengthening domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and further improvements in external demand
The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals
In particular, aggressive adjustments in US interest rates have contributed to a strong US dollar environment
The impact of subsidy adjustments on consumption spending is expected to be contained by targeted financial assistance
For the Malaysian economy, economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months
The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 600 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting
Private consumption is, however, expected to moderate as households continue adjusting to the higher cost of living amidst an uncertain economic environment
In Asia, growth has been sustained by improvements in export performance amid moderating domestic economic activity
Together, these measures will cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and support the improvement in economic activity
Investment activity and prospects have also improved, underpinned by the realisation of multi-year projects and positive growth outlook
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators are in line with expectations, suggesting moderate expansion of economic activity for the third quarter
The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery
Consequently, the Bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term, the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity
The growth of financing to the private sector has improved, consistent with the pace of economic activity
Underlying inflation is expected to remain broadly stable, reflecting the continued expansion in economic activity and the absence of strong demand pressures
At the Monetary Policy Committee MPC meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate OPR by 75 basis points to 2.50 percent with immediate effect
For 2021, growth will be within the projected range of 3 - 4
The strong imports of capital goods, manufacturing investment approvals and foreign direct investment inflows are indicators of sustained investment activity
Nevertheless, the trend of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain
The price pressures being experienced by the global economy are expected to persist over the medium term, arising from higher food, fuel and commodity prices
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average below 1.0 for the year
The intensification of global trade tensions could affect sentiments and weigh on trade, investment and consumption
In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to have peaked in 3Q 2022 and is expected to moderate thereafter, albeit remaining elevated
The MPC is not on any pre-set course, which means that monetary policy decisions will continue to depend on evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth
On the external front, global growth is expected to continue to support the growth of the Malaysian economy
The outlook, however, is subject to global commodity price developments
Looking ahead, structural issues and geopolitical developments will continue to constrain growth of the global economy despite the highly accommodative monetary conditions
The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 600 p.m. on the same day as the Monetary Policy Committee meeting
While inflationary pressures are not expected to intensify, the rate of inflation is expected to remain in the region of the current levels for some time
Substantial policy stimuli introduced by many economies, coupled with the gradual easing of containment measures globally, would partially mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19
Private consumption and investment activity also continued to sustain domestic demand amid a slower pace in public sector spending
Additionally, the reopening of international borders since 1 April 2022 would facilitate the recovery in tourism-related sectors
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative
The growth would be driven mainly by domestic demand, fuelled by private sector consumption and investment, with the public sector playing a strong supportive role
In the MPCs assessment, while inflation remains a concern, the increased uncertainties on the global and domestic economic growth prospects and their potential consequences could have a moderating impact on inflation
The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has continued to stabilise
In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by sustained domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid the weaker external environment
At the current OPR level, the monetary policy stance remains supportive of the economy and is consistent with the current assessment of inflation and growth prospects
The latest available data from the major industrial economies indicate a moderation of economic activity in these countries
Bank Negara Malaysia today announced that the Overnight Policy Rate OPR is raised by 30 basis points to 3 percent
For Malaysia, supply disruptions in the mining and agriculture sectors led to more moderate growth in the second quarter of 2018
The global economic expansion remains moderate, with divergent growth momentum across economies in the first quarter of 2015
Exports and industrial production have declined steeply, while private investment activities have slowed down in recent months as businesses scaled back their spending
Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely the evolving developments and will undertake the appropriate policy response to avoid a severe economic downturn
As in other regional countries, Malaysias export growth has, however, slowed in recent months
Positive developments in manufacturing production, financing activity, external trade and labour market conditions reaffirm the assessment that the economic recovery is gaining strength
The global economic activity is showing signs of improvement, albeit at an uneven pace
For the Malaysian economy, indicators suggest that the economy registered sustained performance in the fourth quarter of 2013
Amid continued strength in global demand, supply chain disruptions, higher commodity prices and labour shortages, inflation has also risen
The global economy continues to experience modest growth
Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies
Looking ahead, growth is expected to gain further momentum in 2022
The latest indicators have continued to signal further improvements in the international economic and financial conditions
However, shifts in global liquidity have resulted in significant capital flows into the emerging economies, in particular, into the Asian region, and have brought with it risks to macroeconomic and financial stability
The future thrust of monetary policy will depend on further information on the relative dominance of either risk going forward
Global commodity and energy prices are projected to remain elevated during the year, with inflation in major trading partners also expected to rise further
Global economic conditions have weakened in the recent period
In the MPCs assessment, there remain continued uncertainties emanating from the global economic and financial environment
Banking system liquidity remains ample
Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely and assess the evolving developments in setting future monetary and financial policies
On the external front, while export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, manufactured exports will continue to benefit from the improvement in economic activity in several advanced economies and the sustained growth in Asia
For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators and supply disruptions in commodity-related sectors point to moderate expansion of economic activity in the fourth quarter
Coming off a strong performance in 2022, growth in 2023 is expected to moderate amid a slower global economy
Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged 2.3, and is projected to average between 2.0 and 3.0 for 2021
At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth
Domestic demand is expected to moderate, reflecting the public sector consolidation and some moderation in private consumption
Banking system liquidity remains sufficient
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments to inform the assessment on the domestic inflation and growth trajectories going into 2025
Several regional economies have reported positive growth in the third quarter, indicating that recovery in the region is ongoing
Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and from regional demand
Meanwhile, upside risks to growth mainly emanate from greater spillover from the tech upcycle, more robust tourism activity, and faster implementation of investment projects
Some weakening in the international economic conditions could affect export growth
Going forward, growth is expected to remain anchored by firm private sector expenditure
Nevertheless, upward pressure on prices would be partly contained by existing price controls and the continued spare capacity in the economy
Moving forward, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
The ringgit currently does not reflect Malaysias economic fundamentals and growth prospects
In the Malaysian economy, the expansion in domestic activity was supported by improvements in exports
Tourist spending is expected to continue to increase
Overall, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path
In Asia, growth will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand
Headline inflation moderated to 3.9 in May, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices during the month
Weaker international oil and commodity prices and global competition, combined with a moderate environment of wage and price increases in the domestic economy sustained the downward trend in inflation
The Malaysian economy is therefore expected to sustain steady growth over the medium term
The adverse global developments have already affected the Malaysian economy, as evidenced by the slowdown in export performance and lower equity prices
Private consumption will be supported by stable employment conditions, income growth and public sector measures
As expected, both headline and core inflation have moderated, mainly due to easing cost pressures
The region is also being affected by global inflationary pressures arising from the higher commodity and food prices
Uncertainties in the global economy, the policy environment and geopolitical developments may, however, result in bouts of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets
Investment activity would be supported by continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects
The impact of the consumption tax policy on headline inflation in 2019 will start to lapse towards the end of the year
These global developments have prompted authorities to provide significant liquidity support to the financial system, undertake financial sector resolution measures, as well as fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to support economic growth
While the growth outlook is subject to some downside risks stemming from weaker-than-expected global growth, upside risks mainly emanate from domestic factors such as stronger-than-expected tourism activity and faster implementation of projects
Nevertheless, the pace of recovery will be uneven across sectors, with economic activity in some industries remaining below pre-pandemic levels, and a slower improvement in the labour market
Growth momentum has been lifted by stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy as firms invest in productive capacity, raise wages and hire more workers
Risks to growth are tilted to the downside, primarily from potential escalation of trade tensions and commodity-related shocks
Malaysias favourable economic prospects and domestic structural reforms, complemented by ongoing initiatives to encourage flows, will continue to provide enduring support to the ringgit
At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity
With this decision, the MPC has withdrawn the monetary stimulus intended to address the COVID-19 crisis in promoting economic recovery
Nevertheless, given the modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices are likely to be contained
Over the medium term, domestic structural reforms will provide more enduring support to the ringgit
Although pressures in the international financial markets have receded following the recent policy announcements to address the European crisis, a number of important policy issues remain unresolved and continue to unsettle financial markets
The global growth momentum has continued to be modest
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2010
Going forward, growth is expected to strengthen further, supported by domestic demand and continued improvement in external demand, particularly from the regional economies
Additional policy support, particularly in the US, is expected to lift growth further
Further progress in the financial sector resolution has also been made in several advanced economies, the success of which is a key precondition for the stabilisation of economic and financial conditions
Consequently, several central banks are expected to adjust their monetary policy settings at a faster pace to reduce inflationary pressures
Overall, there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic environment over the policy horizon
Growth will remain driven by domestic demand
Nevertheless, volatility in the international financial markets has increased following concerns over the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in several advanced economies
The positive growth performance is expected to be sustained, driven by both domestic and external demand
In the MPCs assessment, there continue to be uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Looking ahead, the baseline estimate is for global growth to improve slightly in 2017
The cumulative impact of previous price adjustments will cause inflation to peak in the third quarter of 2005, and to moderate thereafter
The robust expansion in investment activity would be sustained by the progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the higher realisation of approved investments, as well as the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans
The Malaysian economy expanded by 7.6 in the first quarter of 2004
The Malaysian economy has continued to perform well during the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong domestic demand
The growth outlook is subject to downside risks from weaker-than-expected external demand, and larger declines in commodity production
Global headline and core inflation edged downwards in recent months with prospects of monetary easing in some countries in the second half of the year
The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Both headline and core inflation averaged 1.8 in the first five months of the year
At the same time, the MPC also recognizes the need to ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build up of financial imbalances that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time
Headline inflation is likely to turn negative in some months and remain low in the first half of 2019 before trending upwards as these transitory effects lapse
The global economy registered a stronger than expected recovery in the first quarter, underpinned by favourable growth performance in emerging market economies and some of the advanced economies
Going into 2024, inflation is expected to remain modest
The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2020
The Malaysian economy has been adversely impacted by these global developments
Moving forward, monetary policy would remain accommodative to ensure that the economic recovery is well entrenched
Inflation in 2024 is expected to remain moderate, broadly reflecting stable demand conditions and contained cost pressures
The MPC will ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable economic growth amid price stability
The ringgit continues to be primarily driven by external factors, namely expectations of major economies monetary policy paths and ongoing geopolitical tensions
Globally, financial markets have remained stable
However, this will be transitory as headline inflation is projected to moderate thereafter as this base effect dissipates
This normalisation of monetary conditions also aims to mitigate the risk of broader economic and financial imbalances that could undermine the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The financial sector remains sound, with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers
Global energy and commodity prices are also likely to be contained given the weak global conditions
Headline inflation increased to 0.2 in March 2019 February -0.4, due mainly to the less negative transport inflation at -3.0 February -6.8
Going forward, the economic outlook for Malaysia remains favourable
In 2024, inflation is expected to remain modest, broadly reflecting stable cost and demand conditions
Monetary policy will continue to balance the risks to inflation and growth
The growth outlook will be further supported with greater certainty in domestic policy in the coming months
The MPC will also continue to monitor the risks of destabilising financial imbalances
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average between 2.0 - 3.0 in 2022 as demand continues to improve amid the high-cost environment
1 Core inflation is computed by excluding price-volatile and price-administered items
Domestic investment activity which has been robust will continue to be led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects
At its meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysias Monetary Policy Committee MPC decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate OPR unchanged at 3.50 percent
For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018
The Malaysian economy continued on a steady growth path, with real gross domestic product increasing by 5.8 in the third quarter
To further reduce the cost of intermediation, the MPC also decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Requirement SRR from 4 to 3.5, with effect from 1 December 2008
The recovery in the global economy is progressing amidst continued policy support and improvements in financial conditions
While domestic headline inflation rose towards the end of 2010, it has remained low at 2.2
Since our August Monetary Policy Statement, indicators now show that the economy is stronger, and economic activity is expected to gain momentum going into next year
The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more synchronised across countries
In the MPCs assessment, there are increased uncertainties to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation
Financial conditions remain supportive of growth
The MPC will also continue to assess risks of destabilising financial imbalances
Consequently, central banks are expected to continue adjusting their monetary policy settings, some at a faster pace, to reduce inflationary pressures
The pace of recovery, however, varies across countries
Going forward, indicators point to continued growth, underpinned by support from private sector spending
The MPC remains vigilant to cost factors, including those arising from financial market developments, that could affect the inflation outlook
The future stance of monetary policy would therefore depend on Bank Negara Malaysias assessment of new information regarding the domestic and international environment and their implications on the Malaysian economy
Despite the global financial turmoil, domestic credit conditions have remained favourable as demand for financing continues to be supported by the ample liquidity in the financial system
In the domestic economy, the pace of recovery is gaining momentum
Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and regional demand
The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite periods of volatility primarily due to global developments
This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions including from further stress in the banking sector
Domestic economic activity, however, remains strong
In this challenging environment, the Malaysian economy is expected to expand at a more moderate pace in 2016 after registering a 5 percent growth in 2015
For 2019, domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth
For the regional economies, after registering strong economic expansion in the first half of the year, the slower pace of export growth will have some impact on economic performance
In confronting this more difficult environment, the Malaysian economy will benefit from having diversified sources of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, manageable level of external debt, and a well-capitalised banking system and developed capital markets that provide continued access to financing
Going forward, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors
Emerging economies, however, are recording a stronger recovery
The global growth momentum has moderated in recent months
Financial conditions also remain supportive
Labour market conditions and income prospects remain positive, with unemployment and underemployment declining further
In the region, the recovery continues, although the pace of economic growth has moderated arising from a weakening of external demand
It also excludes the estimated direct impact of tax policy changes
While some uncertainty still remains, the broad underlying trend towards lower inflationary pressures is expected to continue into 2007
The progress of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme will also lift sentiments and contribute towards recovery in economic activity
Furthermore, in the event that global growth is lower than currently projected, it would have a mitigating effect on global prices
Several major economies have begun relaxing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the gradual resumption of economic activity
Global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets
The decline in consumer prices, however, is expected to be temporary
Investment activity is also projected to remain robust, led by capital spending by the private sector, particularly in the mining, manufacturing and services sectors
For the Malaysian economy, the advance GDP estimate points to an improvement in economic activity in the third quarter
However, downside risks to growth remain
The impact of these cost factors is, however, expected to be mitigated by the continued low energy and commodity prices and the generally subdued global inflation
Going forward, exports are expected to be supported by the global tech upcycle, continued strength in non-EE goods and higher tourist spending
Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained
At its meeting today, Bank Negara Malaysias Monetary Policy Committee decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate OPR unchanged at 3.50 percent
This is expected to be partially offset by the overall lower global commodity and energy prices
The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy
The MPC remains vigilant to ongoing developments to inform the assessment on the domestic inflation and growth trajectories
The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments, arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions, as well as domestic policy measures on administered prices
For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued strength in exports and private sector activity
The Malaysian economy grew within expectations in the first quarter of the year, supported by both domestic and external factors
Downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, higher risk aversion in global financial markets amid more aggressive monetary policy tightening in major economies, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and re-emergence of significant supply chain disruptions
Measures under Budget 2024 will also provide additional impetus to economic activity
The global economy continues to expand albeit with some divergence across economies while global trade sustained its growth momentum
The global economy continues to expand moderately
The MPC recognises that there are downside risks in the global economic and financial environment and is closely monitoring and assessing their implications on domestic price stability and growth
Looking ahead, global growth is expected to be sustained, as headwinds from tight monetary policy and reduced fiscal support will be cushioned by positive labour market conditions and moderating inflation
Since March 2020, Bank Negara Malaysia has provided additional liquidity of approximately RM42 billion into the domestic financial markets, via various tools including outright purchase of government securities, reverse repos and the reduction in Statutory Reserve Requirement
The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.00 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively
The expansion of the Malaysian economy continues to be well supported by strong underlying fundamentals
Investment activity would be supported by the ongoing progress of multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, the implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans, as well as the higher realisation of approved investments
Bank Negara Malaysias monetary operations continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity
While the Malaysian economy is affected by the global developments, domestic demand has continued to support growth, driven by firm consumption and investment activity
The inflation rate is expected to edge upwards in the next few months, before moderating in the later part of 2005
In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year
Underlying inflation, however, is expected to remain relatively subdued in 2022
The MPC views the latest data on key international and domestic economic variables as being supportive of its assessment that going forward, the risks to inflation are on the upside, while the risks to growth are on the downside
The growth trajectory is projected to improve from the second quarter onwards
While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the pace of recovery has continued at a modest and uneven pace
Exports and retail spending indicators affirm the positive growth momentum, supported by the transition to endemicity
Going forward, unresolved trade tensions remain a key source of risk, affecting global trade and investment activities
This is consistent with the monetary policy stance of supporting a steady growth path amid price stability
The growth would be mainly private sector driven, with the public sector having a strong supportive role
Based on this assessment, the current level of the OPR is consistent with the medium term outlook for growth and inflation
In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014
The fiscal stimulus packages, alongside monetary and financial measures, will continue to underpin the improving economic outlook
The Malaysian economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2017
Looking ahead, despite the varying impacts of the significantly lower oil prices on economies, the overall global economy is expected to benefit from this development
Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside
The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and volatility in global financial markets
Going forward, these domestic drivers of growth, alongside stable labour market and wage growth, are expected to remain supportive of economic activity
While the risks of destabilising financial imbalances are contained, the MPC will monitor these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects
Domestic inflation edged higher in June and July mainly on account of increases in food and energy prices
In the advanced economies, growth will continue to be mainly driven by positive labour market conditions and policy support
While domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth, there are some signs of tightening of financial conditions
The adjustment to the OPR is intended for the degree of monetary accommodativeness to remain consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy
Global trade is showing strong growth momentum
In the advanced economies, rising wages and policy support will provide further impetus to growth
The meeting also approved the schedule of Monetary Policy Committee meetings for 2008
Domestic demand therefore remains the main driver of growth
The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy
Mitigating factors that would prevent inflationary pressures from building up include growing productivity and capacity expansion, as well as a lack of significant general demand pressures
Going forward, the Bank will maintain its focus on the medium term outlook for inflation and growth, and will carefully assess global and domestic developments in setting the stance of monetary policy
The overall outlook remains subject to downside risks, primarily due to the risk of further resurgence of COVID-19 infections which could lead to weaker business, employment and income conditions
These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy
The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments
Given the improvement in economic activity amid lingering cost pressures, underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to trend higher to average between 2.0 - 3.0 in 2022
This will continue to pose headwinds to the global growth outlook
This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy
The recovery in the global economy continues to gather pace, supported by continued expansionary economic policies, improved financial conditions and a strong rebound in several emerging economies
At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate OPR at 3
With improving domestic economic conditions, and as price pressures and inflationary expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support to economic activity
The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically
For 2018, the global economy is projected to experience sustained growth
The prospects are for the economy to expand within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year and 4 to 5 percent in 2016
The overnight policy rate OPR will therefore remain unchanged at its current level of 2.70
The MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards further normalisation of monetary conditions
In line with earlier assessments, the average headline inflation is expected to be negative in 2020 due mainly to the substantially lower global oil prices
Global economic expansion continues, albeit at a more moderate pace, across major advanced and emerging market economies in the first quarter of the year
However, the MPC will be monitoring these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects
Domestic headline inflation increased to 3.3 in May on account of higher food and fuel prices
The labour market is further lifted by a lower unemployment rate, higher labour participation and better income prospects
The risk to domestic price stability is now substantially reduced
Inflation during the first four months of 2007 averaged 2.4 and has continued its downward trend
Due to the revised schedule of international meetings, the September MPC meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday 10 September and Friday 11 September 2015, from Wednesday 2 September and Thursday 3 September 2015
The external sector will continue to be constrained by weak external environment
Inflation is expected to be contained in 2007 due to lower import prices and expansion of domestic capacity
In the emerging economies, growth is projected to be supported by sustained domestic activity and stronger external demand
Given the uncertainties associated with both the inflation and economic outlook, particularly in relation to the impact of high oil prices, the balance of these risks will be closely monitored in setting the future course of monetary policy
The MPCs assessment is that the risks to inflation are on the upside
In the advanced economies, diminishing labour market slack and additional policy support will provide further impetus to growth
Going forward, inflation is, however, expected to remain above its long-run average due to the higher domestic cost factors
While export growth will be affected by the lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve
Looking ahead, while global growth is expected to continue, the outlook is vulnerable to downside risks arising from the prevailing fragilities that are both cyclical and structural, excessive leverage, the sharp declines in commodity prices and the rising geopolitical risks
On the demand side, growth remained supported by private sector activity with further impetus from net exports
BNM will continue to manage risks arising from heightened financial market volatility
Growth will be underpinned by the firm expansion of domestic demand
However, global growth continues to be supported by improvements in labour market conditions, and the full reopening of most economies and international borders
Growth in the advanced economies during this period has remained modest
The ringgit, along with most emerging market currencies, has experienced sharp adjustments and significant volatility due to continuing uncertainties in global economic and policy environment, and geopolitical developments
The sharply adverse global developments have resulted in steep declines in Malaysias exports and industrial production, which have in turn affected private sector activity and labour market conditions
Support from the external sector is expected to soften, in tandem with the moderating global growth momentum
Furthermore, while exports of electrical and electronic products have contracted, net exports have remained firm, supported by stronger exports of commodities and resource-based manufactured goods
The Malaysian financial system remains strong and the monetary transmission process is functioning to deliver the impact of the policy stimulus to the economy
While export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve
The overnight policy rate OPR will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70
