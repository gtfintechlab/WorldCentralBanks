    "2014": [
        "The Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to temporarily increase the Bank of Russia key rate to 7.00% effective from 11:00 Moscow time 3 March 2014.",
        "The decision is aimed at preventing the risks for inflation and financial stability arising from the recent increase in financial market volatility.",
        "On 16 June 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 7.5 percent per annum.",
        "In case existing inflation risks materialise, and threats to medium-term inflation targets emerge, the Bank of Russia will continue increasing the key rate.",
        "Significant inflation acceleration in February‑May 2014 was prompted by a number of unforeseen factors, i.e.",
        "the considerable impact of exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices, as well as unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods.",
        "Taking into account that monetary policy influence on the economy is distributed over time, inflation slowing to the 5.0% target in 2014 is unlikely.",
        "However, maintaining current monetary policy stance will ensure a slowdown in consumer price inflation to the target levels in the medium term.",
        "The annual rate of consumer price growth is estimated at 7.6% as of 9 June 2014.",
        "Core inflation increased to 7.0% in May 2014.",
        "The main reason for inflation acceleration is the effect of the observed rouble depreciation on prices of a wide range of goods and services.",
        "Moreover, there were a number of specific factors affecting the markets for some food items and boosting their prices.",
        "Against this backdrop, household inflation expectations rose, which also had an impact on consumer prices.",
        "So far the rise of the Bank of Russia key rate has had a small effect on bank lending and deposit rates, as well as on volumes of these operations.",
        "In March‑April lending and rouble deposit rates slightly increased.",
        "However, rouble deposit growth rates continued to decline while lending growth rates, in contrast, kept increasing.",
        "The ongoing economic slowdown does not have a considerable restraining effect on consumer price growth since it is caused largely by structural factors.",
        "Historically low unemployment rate constrains economic growth potential.",
        "Due to demographic trends the impact of this factor will persist in the long run.",
        "Utilisation of commercially viable production capacity remains high.",
        "Labour productivity growth is sluggish, while fixed capital investment continues to contract because of declining profits in the real sector, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, as well as low producer and consumer confidence.",
        "Uncertainty about international political situation also hampers production and investment.",
        "Besides, weak economic activity in most countries, which are Russia’s trading partners, restrains the economic growth in Russia.",
        "At the same time, persistently high oil prices have a stabilising effect on the domestic economy and public finance.",
        "Consumer demand remains the main driver of economic growth.",
        "However, in April there were some signals of its decline following a temporary increase in previous months on the back of price growth expectations.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia projections, in 2014 economic growth will slow down to 0.4%.",
        "Boost to economy from the observed rouble depreciation will be limited.",
        "Amid economic uncertainty and declining producer confidence this year there is a high probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment.",
        "The combination of slowdown in real wages growth and a decline in household lending growth rates will have a dampening effect on consumer activity.",
        "Net exports will make a positive contribution to economic growth.",
        "In the second half of 2014, economic growth is expected to accelerate slightly against the backdrop of alleviated geopolitical tension and improving producer sentiment.",
        "Rouble depreciation in late 2013 — early 2014 will continue affecting consumer prices in the coming months.",
        "Nevertheless, given the stabilisation in the foreign exchange market in April — early June 2014, the contribution of exchange rate dynamics to inflation will decline.",
        "In the second half of the year, lower planned increases in administered prices and tariffs, low demand pressure due to the aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential, as well as good expected harvest will also facilitate a slowdown in consumer price growth.",
        "In turn, lower inflation will contribute to a decline in inflation expectations.",
        "Taking into account that the observed acceleration in consumer price growth was prompted by unforeseen factors, while monetary policy influence on the economy is distributed over time, inflation slowing to the target level of 5.0% in 2014 is unlikely.",
        "However, maintaining current monetary policy stance will ensure a slowdown in consumer price inflation to the target levels in the medium term.",
        "Still, the risk of inflation exceeding the target remains high not only in the short term but also in the medium term.",
        "That risk is related to rouble exchange rate dynamics affected by, inter alia, monetary policy measures of the foreign central banks and geopolitical situation.",
        "Other sources of risk are inflation expectations dynamics, conditions in the food commodities markets as well as a possible revision of planned changes in administered prices.",
        "If these risks materialise and it puts medium-term inflation targets under threat, the Bank of Russia will continue increasing the key rate.",
        "On 12 September 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 8.0 percent per annum.",
        "In August — early September 2014 the year-on-year consumer prices growth rate increased again due to materialisation of inflation risks associated with aggravation of geopolitical tensions, the imposition of external trade restrictions and the impact of these developments on the ruble exchange rate dynamics.",
        "As a result, consumer price growth rate is likely to remain exceeding 7% till the end of 2014.",
        "In addition to this, the risks related to possible changes in tax and tariff policy persist.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates current monetary policy stance will ensure decline in consumer price growth rate to the target of 4% in the medium run.",
        "The Bank of Russia will decide whether it is appropriate to change the key rate considering the risks for achieving medium-term inflation target taking into account economic development prospects.",
        "If inflation expectations remain at the elevated level and the threat of inflation exceeding the target in the medium-term emerge the Bank of Russia may continue raising the key rate.",
        "The year-on-year consumer price growth rate stood at an estimated 7.7% as of 8 September.",
        "Core inflation rose to 8.0% in August 2014.",
        "Higher price growth rates for non-food products excluding petrol amounted to 5.3%.",
        "At the same time prices growth for non-food items was observed in certain commodity groups of imported goods and was caused by more prolonged than supposed influence of ruble depreciation at the end of 2013 — in early 2014.",
        "Inflation acceleration was provoked, inter alia, by the imposition of external restrictions in early August and developed in spite of lower indexation of administered prices and utility tariffs and lower prices for fruit and vegetables due to the new harvest.",
        "Given these circumstances inflation expectations of households and firms increased.",
        "Current monetary conditions set the basis for inflation deceleration in the medium run.",
        "According to the estimates, the year-on-year the growth rate of money supply decreased from 17.1% on 1 September 2013 to 6.5% on 1 September 2014.",
        "Growth of interest rates on household deposits contributes to increase in propensity to save and increase attractiveness of deposits for cash holdings.",
        "Given interest rates growth and an increase of requirements to borrowers, lending sees further decrease.",
        "At the same time, the lending market adjustment to new market conditions and to the earlier decisions made by the Bank of Russia has not finished yet.",
        "Economic activity remains weak.",
        "Anaemic economic growth is mostly caused to a significant degree by structural reasons.",
        "Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and competitive productive capacities — is high.",
        "However, labour productivity growth is sluggish.",
        "Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply decreases.",
        "External political uncertainty has an adverse impact on economic activity along with structural factors.",
        "Investment activity remains low amid low business confidence and limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets.",
        "At the same time the rate of decrease in fixed capital investments is slowing down.",
        "Consumer activity sees gradual decline amid the slowdown in real wages growth and the saturation of consumer lending market.",
        "Economic slack in most countries that are Russia’s trading partners restrains the economic growth in Russia.",
        "At the same time oil prices remains high even after resent decline, thus supporting the national economy .",
        "In the second half of 2014 further slowdown in economic growth is expected amid the imposition of sanctions against Russian companies and the remaining uncertainty.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the year-on-year GDP growth rate is to decline to 0.2% in 2014 Q3 and amount to 0.4% as of the end of 2014.",
        "Should the external political situation normalize, economic uncertainty decrease and expectations of economic agents improve, investment activity will see gradual recovery.",
        "Consumer demand growth will stabilise at a lower level.",
        "Net export contribution to GDP growth will stand close to zero.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, GDP growth rate in 2015 will amount to 0.9-1.1%.",
        "Consumer price growth rate with high probability is likely to remain exceeding 7% till the end of 2014.",
        "Further inflation dynamics will be determined, inter alia, by the speed of adjustment of the economy to the imposed restrictions.",
        "The increase in consumer prices growth caused by the aforementioned factor is unlikely to be protracted.",
        "In the absence of negative shocks, decline in inflation and inflation expectations is expected to resume in the first half of 2015 as the impact of the mentioned restrictions on prices is exhausted.",
        "Subdued aggregate demand along with total output of goods and services remaining slightly below potential will also facilitate inflation reduction.",
        "Current monetary policy stance will ensure deceleration of inflation to the target of 4% in the medium term.",
        "On 25 April 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the key rate to 7.5 percent per annum due to higher inflation risks.",
        "The probability of inflation exceeding the 5.0% target at the end of 2014 has increased substantially.",
        "This has been caused by more pronounced than expected pass-through effect of the exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices, the rise in inflation expectations, as well as unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods.",
        "The Bank of Russia does not intend to lower the key rate in the coming months.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates that the adopted decision would ensure the decline in inflation to no more than 6.0% by the end of 2014.",
        "In March - April 2014, the year-on-year consumer price growth rate rose and stood at 7.2% as of 21 April 2014.",
        "Weekly inflation has persisted at 0.2%.",
        "Inflation acceleration has been mainly caused by the larger than expected impact of exchange rate dynamics.",
        "Unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods, such as dairy products, sugar, pork, and petrol, also have contributed to higher inflation rates.",
        "Some additional inflationary pressure has come from a temporary surge in consumer demand for non-food goods amid the rise of inflation expectations.",
        "As a result, there was the increase in prices for a wide range of goods, including domestically produced goods, as well as services.",
        "In March 2014, core inflation accelerated to 6.0% from 5.6% in February.",
        "The current economic slowdown is predominantly structural by nature and thus does not exert any noticeable downward pressure on inflation.",
        "Historically low unemployment rate constrains economic growth potential.",
        "Due to demographic trends the impact of this factor will persist in the long run.",
        "Utilisation of commercially viable production capacity remains relatively high.",
        "Labour productivity growth is sluggish, while fixed capital investment continues to contract because of declining profits in the real sector, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, as well as low producer and consumer confidence.",
        "Uncertainty about international political situation also hampers production and investment.",
        "Besides, weak economic activity in most countries, which are Russia’s trading partners, restrains the economic growth of Russia.",
        "At the same time, persistently high oil prices have a stabilising effect on the domestic economy and public finance.",
        "In March - April 2014, household rouble deposit rates began to grow.",
        "This was caused by the conversion of funds to foreign currency due to higher inflation expectations and by increasing bank funding costs, inter alia, as a result of the Bank of Russia’s decision to raise the key rate in March 2014.",
        "In addition, banks tighten lending conditions, in particular, by increasing loan rates.",
        "At the same time, weak economic activity restrains demand for loans and respectively curbs a rise of interest rates on loans.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia projections, a year of 2014 will continue to witness a downward trend in economic growth.",
        "Boost to economy from the observed rouble depreciation will be limited.",
        "Amid economic uncertainty and declining producer confidence there is a strong probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment.",
        "Combination of slower growth in real wages and a decline in household lending growth rates will have a dampening effect on consumer activity.",
        "Inflation will stay around the current level until the mid-2014.",
        "In the second half of the year, consumer price growth will decelerate as a result of lower planned hikes in administered prices and tariffs, falling inflation expectations, and the aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential.",
        "Since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, the probability of inflation exceeding the 5.0% target at end-2014 has increased substantially.",
        "The adopted decision on the key rate would ensure the decline in inflation to no more than 6.0% by the end of 2014 and help to maintain the appropriate balance of inflation risks and the risks of further economic slowdown.",
        "In the medium term the effect of factors behind the observed acceleration in consumer price growth will be exhausted and in the absence of any new shocks to the economy inflation will hit the target levels set in the Guidelines for the Single State Monetary Policy in 2014 and for 2015 and 2016.",
        "On 25 July 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the the Bank of Russia key rate to 8.0 percent per annum.",
        "Inflation deceleration in July 2014 has been slower than expected.",
        "At the same time, inflation risks have increased due to a combination of factors, including, inter alia, the aggravation of geopolitical tension and its potential impact on the ruble exchange rate dynamics, as well as potential changes in tax and tariff policy.",
        "The build-up of these risks will lead to inflation expectations remaining heightened and creates threats of inflation exceeding the target in the coming years.",
        "The adopted decision is aimed at slowing the consumer price growth to the 4.0% target level in the medium term.",
        "If high inflation risks persist, the Bank of Russia will continue raising the key rate.",
        "In June 2014, the year-on-year consumer price growth rate increased to 7.8% and core inflation grew to 7.5%.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation expectations stayed elevated.",
        "The main reason for inflation acceleration was the effect of the observed ruble depreciation on prices of a wide range of goods and services.",
        "Moreover, there were a number of specific factors boosting prices for some food items.",
        "July has seen signs of inflation slowdown.",
        "However, deceleration in consumer price growth has been slower than expected.",
        "The annual consumer price growth rate stood at estimated 7.5% as of 21 July.",
        "Inflation deceleration was mainly caused by lower increases in administered prices and utility tariffs.",
        "Price growth rates for other goods and services have stabilised as a result of decreasing impact of ruble depreciation seen in January-March 2014 on consumer prices, along with improved conditions in food markets due to, inter alia, the new harvest coming in.",
        "Over Q2 2014 the moderate recovery of economic activity has been observed.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the GDP growth rate was close to zero in Q2 following negative figures earlier.",
        "Low economic growth rates are largely caused by structural factors.",
        "Utilisation of production factors — labor force and commercially viable production capacities — is high.",
        "Labour productivity growth is sluggish.",
        "Due to the demographic trends labour force shortage will continue to affect economic growth in the long term.",
        "Along with structural factors, external political uncertainty has a negative impact on economic activity.",
        "Investment demand remains weak amid low business confidence, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, and declining profits in the real sector.",
        "Besides, consumer activity is cooling.",
        "Economic slack in most countries that are Russia’s trading partners does not contribute to acceleration in economic growth.",
        "At the same time, persistently high oil prices support domestic economy.",
        "Under the scenario of no negative shocks, annual inflation will decline in the second half of 2014.",
        "The factors of inflation decline are exhausted impact of ruble depreciation seen in January-March 2014 on consumer prices, lower scale of increase in administered prices and tariffs, expected good harvest, as well as subdued aggregate demand with aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential.",
        "At the same time, there is an increased probability of negative trends which may result in inflation acceleration.",
        "These shocks include aggravation of geopolitical tension, adjustments in monetary policy of foreign central banks and the potential impact of those factors on national currency exchange rate dynamics, tax and tariff policy changes under discussion.",
        "Against this background the adopted decision will set conditions for a decline in annual consumer price growth rates to 6.0-6.5% by the end of 2014 and to the target level of 4.0% in the medium term.",
        "If high inflation risks persist, the Bank of Russia will continue raising the key rate.",
        "From 16 December 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the Bank of Russia key rate to 17.00 percent per annum.",
        "This decision is aimed at limiting substantially increased ruble depreciation risks and inflation risks.",
        "From 16 December 2014 in order to strengthen the efficiency of monetary policy loans secured by non-marketable assets or guarantees for 2 to 549 days will be provided at a floating interest rate, set at the Bank of Russia key rate level, increased by 1.75 percentage points (up to the present these loans for 2 to 90 days were provided at fixed rate).",
        "Moreover, for further expanse of credit institution ability to manage their foreign exchange liquidity it was decided to increase maximum allotment amount for 28-day FX REPO auctions from 1.5 to 5.0 billion USD and to conduct 12-month FX REPO auctions on weekly basis.",

        "On 14 March 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 7.0 percent per annum.",
        "High inflation risks that brought about an increase in the key rate on 3 March 2014 still remain.",
        "Unstable external conditions and a rise in financial market volatility are conducive to an increase in economic uncertainty.",
        "Against this backdrop the Bank of Russia’s priority is to contain the effect of exchange rate dynamics on inflation and to maintain financial stability.",
        "Hence, the Bank of Russia does not intend to lower the key rate in the coming months.",
        "The global economy continues to recover slowly.",
        "Persistently weak economic growth in most of Russia’s trading partners curbs demand for exports from Russia and restrains the domestic economy.",

        "Consumer demand is still the major driver of economic growth.",
        "It is supported by still high growth in retail lending.",
        "However, a decline in consumer activity is observed against the backdrop of a slower real wages growth and of a deteriorating consumer sentiment.",
        "The aggregate output of goods and services remains somewhat below potential.",
        "In February — early March 2014, the year-on-year growth rate of consumer prices rose and reached 6.4% as of 11 March 2014.",
        "Inflation acceleration was caused by the dynamics of prices for some food items, in particular, vegetables and fruit, along with dairy products.",
        "To some extent the rouble exchange rate dynamics has contributed to consumer price growth.",
        "In addition, core inflation did not decline in February 2014.",
        "The inflation rates are unlikely to fall until mid-2014 due to the observed rouble depreciation.",
        "Against this backdrop inflation expectations may increase, exerting upward pressure on consumer prices.",
        "On the other hand, the reduction in the growth rates of administered prices and tariffs along with the aggregate output of goods and services remaining somewhat below potential would contribute to inflation slowdown in the second half of 2014.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates that the impact of observed rouble depreciation on economic growth will be limited.",
        "Amid increased uncertainty and declining producer and consumer confidence there is a strong probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment along with a further slowdown in consumption.",
        "As a result, Russian economic growth will be lower than expected.",
        "The noted factors will partially offset the exchange rate pass-through to inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, risks of above-target inflation in 2014 remain.",
        "Given the current monetary policy stance, the slowdown in consumer price growth will resume in the second half of 2014.",

        "During September-October significant changes in external conditions have taken place: considerable fall in oil prices and stricter sanctions imposed by certain countries against several large Russian companies.",
        "As a result the ruble depreciated that together with restrictions on the import of certain food items imposed in August resulted in further acceleration in consumer prices growth.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, inflation will remain above 8% till the end of 2014 and in 2015 Q1.",
        "Continuing high growth of consumer price will result in persistent increase in inflation expectations creating additional inflation risks.",
        "The Bank of Russia will continue to take measures aimed at slowing down consumer prices growth to the target of 4% in the medium run.",
        "If the external conditions improve and inflation and inflation expectation show a stable downward trend, the Bank of Russia will be ready to start monetary policy easing.",

        "Core inflation rose to 8.2% in September 2014.",
        "Acceleration of inflation was mainly provoked by accelerated price growth for food items from 10.3% in August to 11.4% in September.",
        "Price growth rates for non-food products remained stable at 5.5%.",
        "Inflation dynamics was mainly influenced by ruble depreciation and external trade restrictions imposed in August 2014.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, cumulative impact of these factors on the annual consumer prices growth to the end of the 2014 will be about 2.5 pp (of which 1.2 pp — impact of external trade restrictions imposed in August, 1.3 pp — impact of ruble depreciation).",
        "Amid accelerated consumer prices growth, inflation expectations of households and businesses continued to increase imposing additional pressure on prices.",
        "Tighter monetary conditions haven’t offset the influence of the aforementioned factors on inflation expectations yet though monetary aggregates dynamics sets the ground for inflation decline in the medium run.",
        "According to the estimates, annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased from 16.1% on 1 October 2013 to 7.4% on 1 October 2014.",

        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, annual GDP growth rate in 2014 Q3 was 0.2%.",
        "Economic slack does not have considerable restraining effect on consumer prices increase as it is mostly caused by structural factors.",
        "Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and commercially viable productive capacities — is high though labour productivity grows slowly.",
        "Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply decreases.",
        "Besides structural factors, increased external political uncertainty has an adverse impact on economic activity.",
        "Amid limited access to long-term financing and higher borrower requirements from Russian banks, fixed capital investments are contracting.",
        "At the same time consumer demand is cooling down as real wage growth and retail lending are slowing.",
        "External economic conditions have restraining effect on the Russian economy: oil prices see a significant decline while economic activity of most Russia’s trading partners remains weak.",
        "However, exchange rate dynamics and restrictions on the import of certain food items support some industries.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, economic growth rate in 2014 Q4 and 2015 Q1 will be close to zero.",
        "Consumer prices growth is very likely to persist at the current level till the end of Q1 2015 due to remaining sizeable impact of restrictions on the import of certain food items and ruble depreciation in August-October 2014 on prices.",
        "Later, as the economy gradually adjusts to external trade restrictions and the impact of exchange rate dynamics on prices reduction, inflation and inflation expectations are expected to see a renewed decrease.",
        "Slower consumer prices growth will also be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with aggregate goods and services output remaining below the potential.",

        "Core inflation rose to 8.9% in November 2014.",
        "Accelerated consumer prices growth is driven by ruble depreciation in the second half of 2014.",
        "External trade restrictions imposed in August 2014 also affected price dynamics.",
        "Meanwhile, price growth rate for certain food items flattened out due to the increase of supply by the Russian companies and new import contracts.",
        "Amid accelerated consumer prices growth, households’ and businesses’ inflation expectations continued to surge imposing additional pressure on prices.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, end of the year inflation will be around 10%.",
        "At the same time, the cumulative contribution of ruble depreciation, restrictions on imports and other factors specific for the markets of several food products, to year-to-year consumer prices growth will account for 4.9 percentage points by the year-end.",
        "Tighter monetary conditions have not offset the influence of the pro-inflationary factors.",
        "However, current monetary conditions set the ground for inflation decline in the medium run.",
        "According to the estimates as of the 1 of December 2014, annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased to 4.8% from 16.3% a year earlier.",
        "Continuing growth of interest rates on household deposits stimulates the propensity to save and increases the attractiveness of deposits.",
        "Given lending rates hike and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, lending growth (adjusted for currency revaluation) slows down.",
        "Given the decision made today and time lags of the influence of the interest rate decisions made by the Bank of Russia earlier, on the economy, this process will continue.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual GDP growth rate will amount to 0.6% in 2014.",
        "Economic slack does not have considerable restraining effect on consumer prices growth as it is mostly caused by structural factors.",
        "Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and commercially viable productive capacities — is high though labour productivity grows slowly.",
        "Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply shrinks.",
        "The remaining external political uncertainty and considerable deterioration of external conditions, resulting from oil price drop and foreign financial markets inaccessibility for the Russian borrowers, also have an adverse impact on economic activity.",
        "Amid the increase in prices for the imported investment goods, limited access to long-term financing, and tighter lending conditions, fixed capital investments are contracting.",
        "Meanwhile, though the real wage growth and retail lending are slowing, consumer demand remains relatively high due to higher demand for non-food items amid higher inflation expectations.",
        "The exchange rate dynamics partially balances the negative impact of deterioration of the external conditions and contributes to higher competitiveness of Russian goods.",
        "Besides, restrictions on the import of certain food items support the relevant industries.",
        "Due to the considerable change in the external conditions, the Bank of Russia revised its medium-term macroeconomic forecast.",
        "During the next three-year period, economic growth will be lower than previously projected in the baseline scenario due to persistently lower oil prices.",
        "Annual GDP growth is expected to be close to zero in 2015-2016.",
        "Amid persistently restricted access to the international capital markets for Russian companies and relatively cheap energy resources, fixed capital investments will continue to edge lower.",
        "Consumption will remain weak.",
        "At the same time, the new exchange rate mechanism will set grounds for more rapid adjustment of the Russian economy to changing external conditions.",
        "Economic activity is expected to start recovering in 2017 due to the development of import substituting industries and increase in non-commodity exports.",
        "Over the next months, prices for goods and services will continue to be affected by depreciation of the ruble.",
        "During the first quarter of 2015 inflation might be higher than 10%.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation and inflation expectations are forecasted to decrease as the impact of the exchange rate dynamics on prices exhausts and economy gradually adjusts to changing external trade conditions and imposed restrictions on imports.",
        "Slowdown in consumer prices growth will also be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with total goods and services output remaining below the potential.",
        "The current stance of monetary policy will result in inflation decrease to the target level of 4% in the medium term.",
        "In case of further aggravation of inflation risks, the Bank of Russia will continue to raise the key rate.",
        "Should inflation and inflation expectations show a stable downward trend, the Bank of Russia will be ready to start monetary policy easing.",
        "On 14 February 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 5.50 percent per annum.",
        "The decision was based on the analysis of the current trends and macroeconomic projections, that, given unchanged monetary policy stance, by the end of 2014 inflation is expected to be close to the target level amid slow economic growth.",
        "The world economy continues to recover slowly but there are diverse trends observed in different regions.",
        "Weak economic growth in the countries that are Russia’s trading partners curbs demand for Russian exports and restrains the national economy.",
        "At the same time, oil prices remain at consistently high levels.",
        "Russian economy’s growth rates remain low while industrial output continues to stagnate.",
        "Meanwhile, business confidence indices show the lack of improvement in producers’ sentiments.",
        "Weak investment activity is caused by the overall economic uncertainty and lower profits in the real sector.",
        "Fueled by growth in retail lending and high growth of real wages, consumer demand is still a major driver of economic growth .",
        "The aggregate output of goods and services remains somewhat below potential.",
        "Demand for bank loans has not demonstrated any growth amid the slack in economic activity.",
        "This led to a moderate decrease in interest rates on bank loans and on household deposits.",
        "Lending to non-financial organizations showed stable dynamics despite a persistent tightening of requirements for a borrower’s financial standing and a loan collateral quality.",
        "Household loan growth continued to slow down, though stayed rather high.",
        "The Bank of Russia assesses that the current lending dynamics does not restrain economic growth.",
        "In December 2013, the annual growth rate of consumer prices reached 6.5%, surpassing the target range for the specified period.",
        "Acceleration of inflation in 2013 Q4 was largely attributed to rise in prices of fruits and vegetables, along with some milk and poultry products.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates the contribution of this factor to the inflation acceleration in 2013 at 0.5 percentage point.",
        "In early 2014, the annual growth of consumer prices decelerated and stood at 6.1% as of 10 February 2014.",
        "The slowdown in inflation occured due to the decline in the growth rate of food prices.",
        "Core inflation remained stable in the second half of 2013 and in early 2014.",
        "Factors that led to acceleration of inflation at the end of 2013 are expected to exhaust their influence in the first half of 2014.",
        "Amid slow recovery of external demand and weak investment activity, the aggregate output of goods and services will remain below potential.",
        "This factor will contribute to a decrease in the consumer price growth rate.",
        "Slow growth rates in monetary aggregates formed in 2012 and persisted in 2013 will also contain inflation in 2014.",
        "Based on the above specified trends and given the current key rate level, the Bank of Russia expects the downward trend in consumer price growth to continue with inflation rate converging to the target level of 5.0% in late 2014.",
        "Major sources of uncertainty for this forecast are inflationary risks related to accelerated price growth at the end of 2013 and observed currency depreciation.",
        "If the negative impact of these factors spills over to the prices of a wide range of goods and services and to the household expectations, the probability of inflation deviating from the targets will increase.",
        "In this case, the Bank of Russia will be ready to tighten its monetary policy."

        "Based on Bank of Russia estimates, indicators characterizing the most sustainable price movements substantially overshoot 4% (annualised).",

        "In this context, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global prices, on to consumers.",
        "Moreover, further expansion in industrial output is limited by growing labour shortages.",

        "At the same time, both retail and corporate lending markets maintain high activity.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s monetary policy stance will accelerate the formation of tight monetary policy stance needed to return inflation to the target and limit the influence of the currently high inflation on long-term interest rates.",
        "This will solidify a trend towards the growing appeal of household deposits, protect the purchasing power of savings and ensure balanced growth of lending and the economy in general.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, in 2021 Q4, the Russian economy noticeably deviated upwards from the balanced growth path.",
        "Rapid growth in lending, rising real wages and households’ moderate propensity to save, driven by high inflation expectations, support expansion in consumer activity, especially in non-food markets.",
        "Growing domestic and external demand and high corporate profits shore up investment activity.",

        "Overall, the actual decrease in economic activity in 2022 Q2 is less pronounced than the Bank of Russia assumed in its April baseline scenario.",
        "Given the above, the Bank of Russia estimates that the 2022 GDP decline could be lower than forecast in April.",
        "Proinflationary risks continue to abate, though remaining considerable.",

        "The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole.",
        "In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on.",
        "Over a short-term horizon, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations.",
        "An excessive reduction in households’ propensity to save may lead to consumer demand outstripping the capacity to expand output.",
        "Disinflationary risks to the baseline scenario are mainly linked to a consistently high risk premium in credit rates and banks’ elevated requirements for borrowers amid high uncertainty.",
        "This may cause a greater slowdown in lending.",
        "The combination of risks created by the external environment may produce both proinflationary and disinflationary effects.",
        "A further aggravation of external trade and financial restrictions may have a proinflationary effect, thereby leading to a sharper decline in the potential of the Russian economy than expected in the baseline scenario.",
        "Supply-side constraints may in particular strengthen because of a slow replenishment of stocks of finished goods, raw materials and components in the event of persistently negative trends in imports.",
        "The materialisation of growing risks of a global recession could in turn further weaken external demand for Russian exports.",

        "The Bank of Russia’s monetary policy helps make deposits more attractive, increasing households’ propensity to save.",
        "Rising loan rates and more rigid borrower requirements in the context of higher uncertainty have led to a significant tightening in bank lending conditions.",
        "Against this background, a considerable weakening in credit activity is expected in the coming months.",
        "At the same time, the measures taken by the Bank of Russia to stabilise the financial market and regulatory relaxations will combine with the Government’s subsidised lending programmes to maintain the availability of credit resources for businesses, especially in the most vulnerable sectors, and reduce the scale of the expected economic downturn.",
        "Weekly estimates show that inflation has significantly accelerated since early March.",
        "Current price movements are largely driven by a surge in consumer demand for individual product categories against the background of higher uncertainty and rising inflation expectations, as well as the weakening of the ruble since the beginning of 2022.",

        "An additional disinflationary factor was the expansion of supply in a number of goods markets as external and domestic export restrictions remained in place.",
        "However, the overall consumer price index in August, on a monthly seasonally adjusted basis, was decelerating slower, and core inflation went up slightly.",
        "Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated.",
        "Analysts’ medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%.",

        "Despite the recent reduction in deposit rates, the inflow of household funds to credit institutions was overall continued.",
        "Household funds were placed into long-term ruble deposits and current accounts, and withdrawn from short-term ruble deposits.",
        "This reflects a normalisation in the structure of household savings with banks.",
        "Growth in corporate lending accelerated.",
        "A recovery was seen in unsecured consumer lending, alongside with significant growth in mortgage loans.",
        "Credit activity was supported by both government subsidised lending programmes and the key rate reduction that occurred in between April and July.",

        "A growing number of enterprises are adjusting to the new environment.",
        "For all the recovery, consumer activity remains muted.",
        "This is due to the recent drop in real incomes of households as they maintain their propensity to save.",
        "Specifically, the latter factor is explained by, beyond overall economic uncertainty, the reduced supply of several types of goods and services.",
        "Having said that, supply-side constraints on consumer markets have slightly faded as consumer imports are gradually recovering and import substitution is taking place.",
        "The situation in the labour market remains stable in general.",

        "Over a medium-term horizon, proinflationary risks still prevail.",
        "Risks for the baseline scenario are largely associated with the volatility of the ruble exchange rate, which is indicative of the changes in foreign trade flows, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations.",
        "The disinflationary effect over a short-term horizon may be caused by the high propensity of households to save in the conditions of general economic uncertainty, the length of adaptation to the new structure of supply in consumer markets, and expectations of a further price downturn against the background of the strengthening of the ruble since the beginning of the year.",
        "Concurrently, the pass-through of the latter to prices may be longer.",
        "A good harvest of agricultural products in 2022 may be an additional disinflationary factor.",
        "An increase in supply in the domestic market of goods which are subject to export restrictions may also produce more pronounced disinflationary effects.",
        "Short-term proinflationary risks are caused by high and unanchored inflation expectations which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, as well as by the acceleration of consumer lending.",
        "Growth in consumer lending may be strengthened by the easing of banks’ non-price requirements for borrowers and lower risk premiums in interest rates.",
        "If combined, these factors can lead to consumer demand outstripping the capacity to expand output.",
        "A further toughening of external trade and financial restrictions may also create significant proinflationary risks.",
        "They can lead to a greater reduction in the Russian economy’s potential than expected in the baseline scenario.",
        "Supply-side constraints may in particular strengthen because of problems with the procurement of equipment, a slow replenishment of stocks of finished goods, raw materials and components in the event of intensifying negative trends in import dynamics.",

        "Annual inflation has significantly declined since it peaked in the spring.",
        "It still mainly reflects the effects of the sharp surge in prices that occurred between February and April 2022.",
        "At present, inflationary pressures are overall moderate.",
        "However, the current rate of price growth is up slightly, in part due to steady components of inflation.",

        "As for domestic conditions, pro-inflation effects may be more pronounced than in the baseline scenario due to a reduction in the labour force and a change in the employment structure.",
        "Another source of pro-inflation risk could be accelerated growth in real wages that exceeds productivity growth.",
        "High and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, are also a source of risk.",
        "Under these conditions, the growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur increased consumer demand in the future.",
        "A significant disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty, as well as households’ protracted adaptation to a new supply structure in consumer markets.",
        "A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates could additionally tighten monetary conditions, which could restrain lending in the economy.",
        "A more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things may also have a disinflationary effect.",

        "In the baseline scenario, short-term risks are largely associated with the volatility of the ruble exchange rate, which is indicative of the changes in foreign trade flows.",
        "The disinflationary effect on the short-term horizon may be caused by the persistence of households’ high propensity to save in the conditions of general economic uncertainty, prolonged habituation to the new structure of supply in consumer markets, and expectations of further price decline amid the strengthening of the ruble since the beginning of the year.",

        "Also growing are restrictions in the labour market, driven in part by the partial mobilisation.",

        "The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity.",
        "With price and financial stability risks no longer on the rise, conditions have allowed for the key rate reduction.",
        "Recent weekly data indicate a slowdown in current price growth rates on the back of a strengthening of the ruble and a cooling of consumer activity.",
        "Further inflation movements will be shaped by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s monetary policy will take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024.",
        "Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets.",
        "If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia sees room for key rate reduction in 2022.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 18.0–23.0% in 2022, slowing down to 5.0–7.0% in 2023 and returning to 4% in 2024.",
        "Inflation movements Although still high, current growth rates of consumer prices have slowed significantly after they peaked in the first half of March.",
        "The slowdown in inflation comes largely on the back of a stronger ruble and a cooling of consumer activity.",
        "In this context, April saw a decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses.",
        "Further inflation movements will be shaped by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering.",
        "As of 22 April, annual inflation was 17.6% (vs 16.7% in March).",
        "In the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects annual inflation to continue to increase in the coming months, due to the base effect, to total 18.0–23.0% in 2022.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s monetary policy will take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will slow down to 5.0–7.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024.",
        "A sharp tightening in monetary conditions in the first half of March has given way to their softening in several segments of the financial market.",
        "OFZ yields have decreased.",
        "Deposit rates are declining at an outrunning pace.",
        "At the same time, a growing risk premium factored into lending rates and more stringent borrower requirements of banks trigger the emergence of tight price and non-price bank lending conditions.",
        "Against this background, lending activity is decreasing, especially in the retail lending market.",
        "Today’s decision of the Bank of Russia along with current preferential lending programmes of the Government will support the availability of credit resources in the economy and limit the scale of decline in economic activity.",
        "However, the disinflationary impact of monetary policy will remain in place.",
        "Based on Bank of Russia estimates, economic activity began to decline in March 2022.",
        "High-frequency indicators point to a contraction in consumer and business activity.",
        "After a temporary surge, consumer demand is decreasing in real terms, accompanied by a rise in households’ propensity to save.",
        "The decline in imports due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions is outstripping the decline in exports.",
        "Despite the gradual change in the country and commodity structure of exports and imports as new suppliers and sales markets emerge, businesses are experiencing considerable difficulties in production and logistics.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast, GDP will reduce by 8.0–10.0% in 2022.",
        "The decrease will be mainly driven by supply-side factors.",
        "In 2023, the Russian economy will begin growing gradually amid a structural transformation.",
        "In 2023 Q4, output will be up by 4.0–5.5% on the same period in 2022.",
        "However, the overall GDP change in 2023 will be within the range of (-3.0)—0.0% due to the base effect of 2022 Q1.",
        "In 2024, GDP will increase by 2.5–3.5%.",
        "Though having decreased slightly, proinflationary risks are still considerable.",
        "They are primarily associated with a further exacerbation of external trade and financial restrictions.",
        "The decline in the potential of Russia’s economy driven by restrictions may turn out to be more pronounced than the baseline scenario assumes.",
        "Over a short-term horizon, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations.",
        "Disinflationary risks to the baseline scenario are mostly linked to the possible additional tightening of monetary conditions in the economy due to a consistently high risk premium in credit rates and elevated banks’ requirements for borrowers amid high uncertainty.",
        "This may in aggregate lead to a greater slowdown in lending.",
        "Ruble exchange rate dynamics will remain a meaningful factor shaping the path of inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "The movements of the economy and inflation will also depend on future fiscal policy decisions.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s baseline scenario rests on the decisions already made regarding the expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole.",
        "Additional decisions changing fiscal policy parameters may influence the path of the key rate.",
        "Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets.",
        "If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia sees room for key rate reduction in 2022.",

        "The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of increasing the key rate at its upcoming meeting.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decline to 4.0–4.5% in 2025 and stay close to 4% further on.",

        "Nevertheless, long-term inflation expectations calculated based on financial market instruments declined after the July decision on the key rate.",
        "In general, inflation expectations of economic agents remain elevated.",
        "This enhances the inertia of underlying inflation.",
        "GDP data for 2024 Q2 and high-frequency indicators in July—August show that the growth of the Russian economy slowed down slightly.",
        "This deceleration was probably caused not primarily by a cooling of domestic demand but by an increase in supply-side constraints and softening external demand.",
        "This is evidenced by high current inflationary pressures.",
        "The upward deviation of the Russian economy from a balanced growth path is still significant.",

        "Credit and deposit rates continue to grow.",
        "High market interest rates support the propensity to save but have not sufficiently constrained lending yet.",
        "Overall lending growth remains high, despite the deceleration in the retail segment.",
        "Mortgage lending slowed down as a result of the termination of the non-targeted subsidised mortgage programme from 1 July 2024 and the growth in market rates.",
        "The slowdown in consumer lending demonstrated both the effects of the monetary policy pursued and the macroprudential measures taken earlier.",
        "Nevertheless, the growth rate of corporate lending remains elevated due to the significant contribution of transactions that are less sensitive to market rates.",

        "High inflation expectations enhance the inertia of underlying inflation.",
        "The Russian economy continues to grow but at a slower pace than in 2024 H1.",
        "This deceleration is mainly caused by increasing supply-side constraints, including a decrease in the availability of spare production capacity and labour resources.",

        "A disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty as households take time to adapt to a new supply structure in consumer markets.",
        "A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates may additionally tighten monetary conditions, which will restrain lending in the economy.",
        "A disinflationary effect may also be caused by a faster adjustment of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things.",
        "Significant harvest carryovers from 2022 may in turn reduce even more prices in the coming quarters.",
        "Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as the risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets.",
        "In the context of gradually rising inflationary pressures, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of increasing the key rate at its next meetings to stabilise inflation close to 4% in 2024 and further on.",

        "Given gradually rising inflationary pressures, the Bank of Russia’s forthcoming Board meetings will consider the necessity of key rate increase to stabilise inflation close to 4% in 2024 and further on.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 4.5–6.5% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024.",
        "Inflation movements The increase in current price growth rates was held back by a number of factors.",
        "On the one hand, they included an ongoing adjustment of the Russian economy to external trade and financial constraints.",
        "On the other hand, among them was a high level of inventories in a number of goods groups and essentially moderate consumer demand.",
        "Over this background, the weakening of the ruble since late 2022 has so far little shown in price dynamics.",
        "Inflation expectations of households and price expectations of businesses remain elevated, and their trends are diverging.",
        "In April, inflation expectations of households declined, whereas price expectations of companies went up.",
        "That said, there was an increase in the heterogeneity of trends in businesses’ price expectations across industries: since the beginning of 2023, a notable drop in price expectations in agriculture has come with their increase in retail and wholesale trade.",
        "Analysts’ medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%.",
        "Annual inflation will temporarily remain below 4% in the coming months under the influence of last year’s high base effect.",
        "At the same time, the Bank of Russia forecasts that it will begin to grow gradually in the second half of 2023 as the low values of monthly price increases of summer 2022 exit calculations and the moderate levels of sustained inflation expand.",
        "According to the baseline scenario, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 4.5–6.5% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and will be close to 4% further on.",

        "Meaningful inflation risks are related to geopolitical tensions affecting foreign trade terms.",
        "As a result, increasing foreign trade and financial restrictions can further weaken demand for Russian exports, contributing to inflation through exchange rate movements.",
        "Moreover, the increasing complexity of production, supply chains and payments due to external restrictions could lead to both higher import prices and more severe supply-side constraints in the Russian economy.",

    "2015": [
        "On 15 June 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 12.50 to 11.50 percent per annum, taking account of lower inflation risks and persistent risks of considerable economy cooling.",
        "Amid significant contraction in consumer demand and ruble appreciation in February-May 2015, consumer price growth continued to slow down.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given these factors annual inflation will fall to less than 7% in June 2016 to reach the target of 4% in 2017.",
        "The Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate as consumer price growth declines further in compliance with the forecast but the potential of monetary policy easing will be limited by inflation risks in the next few months.",
        "Having reached its peak in March annual inflation fell to 16.4% in April and 15.8% in May.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the annual rate of consumer price growth stood at 15.6% as of 8 June 2015.",
        "Weekly inflation stabilised at about 0.1% in May-early June.",
        "Consumer price growth decline was conditioned primarily by lower consumer demand amid contracting real income, and also ruble appreciation in February-May.",
        "Moreover, prices have adjusted to external trade restrictions imposed in August 2014 without exerting inflationary pressure.",
        "Relatively tough monetary conditions are also conducive to inflation reduction.",
        "Money supply (M2) growth rate remains low.",
        "Lending and deposit rates are adjusted downwards under the influence of previous Bank of Russia decisions to reduce the key rate.",
        "However, they remain high, on the one hand, contributing to attractiveness of ruble savings, and, on the other hand, alongside with tighter borrower and collateral requirements, resulting in lower annual lending growth.",
        "Major macroeconomic indicators demonstrate further economy cooling.",
        "Though structural factors continue hampering the economic growth, output contraction has currently signs of cyclical nature.",
        "It is attested, among other things, by the reduced number of new orders, the on-going decline in production capacity and labour force utilisation, and a certain rise in the unemployment rate.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the labour market adjusts to the new conditions mostly through wage decrease and growing part-time employment.",
        "These factors, alongside with a decrease in retail lending, will result in further decline in consumer spending.",
        "Fixed capital investments will continue to contract due to economic agents’ negative expectations with regard to the Russian economic outlook and tight lending conditions.",
        "Investment demand will also be contained by limited substitution of external sources of funding with domestic ones given shallow Russian financial market and high ruble debt burden.",
        "Implementation of government anti-recessionary measures will facilitate investments.",
        "Sluggish investor and consumer activity will result in low demand for imports.",
        "Given the floating exchange rate, exports will decline less significantly.",
        "As a result, net exports will be the only component to make a positive contribution to output growth.",
        "In 2015, GDP is expected to contract by 3.2%.",
        "Further economic situation will depend on the dynamics of energy prices and the economy’s ability to adapt to external shocks.",
        "According to Bank of Russia forecasts, in 2016, GDP growth will stand at 0.7%, if oil prices recover to US$70 per barrel by late 2016.",
        "However, in case oil prices remain at about US$60 per barrel during 2016, output will contract by 1.2%.",
        "Slack domestic demand will facilitate inflation reduction in 2015-2017.",
        "The ruble appreciation in February-May will have additional restraining influence on prices in the next few months.",
        "A slowdown in consumer price growth will make room for inflation expectations decrease.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia forecast, annual inflation in June 2016 will slow down to less than 7% to reach the target of 4% in 2017.",
        "Inflation risks emanate primarily from aggravation of external economic situation, enhanced inflation expectations, revision of increases in administered prices and tariffs planned for 2016-2017, and fiscal policy easing.",
        "The Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate as inflation risks abate and inflation declines further in compliance with the forecast but the potential of monetary policy easing will be limited by inflation risks in the next few months.",
        "On 11 September 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the key rate at 11.0 percent per annum, due to the higher inflation risks amid persistent risks of considerable economy cooling.",
        "August saw a serious deterioration in foreign economic conditions.",
        "Inflation and inflation expectations were showing a clear upward trend, impacted by the exchange rate dynamics.",
        "The depreciated ruble will continue to put pressure on prices in the next few months.",
        "However, the relatively tough monetary conditions and slack domestic demand will drag down annual inflation.",
        "The annual consumer price growth rate in September 2016 is estimated to be about 7%, reaching 4% in 2017, which will be facilitated by the current monetary policy.",
        "The Bank of Russia will subsequently revise its key rate based on the balance between inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling.",
        "Annual inflation rose from 15.6% in July to 15.8% in August.",
        "As of 7 September 2015, consumer price growth remained unchanged, according to the Bank of Russia’s estimates.",
        "The ruble’s depreciation caused prices for a wide range of goods and services to accelerate, which was the reason for elevated inflation expectations, along with the July indexation of utility tariffs.",
        "The ruble’s decline observed in July-August will continue to put pressure on inflation in the next few months.",
        "The moderately tough monetary policy and weaker consumer demand on the back of significant contraction in real income are projected to hamper consumer price growth.",
        "The relatively tough monetary conditions also contain prices.",
        "Money supply (М2) growth rates remain low.",
        "Lending and deposit rates show a downward trend under the influence of the Bank of Russia’s previous decisions to cut its key rate.",
        "On the one hand, this serves to keep ruble savings attractive; on the other hand, such rates sustain a high debt burden and tight creditworthiness requirements, leading to low annual bank credit growth rates.",
        "According to Rosstat estimates, GDP in Q2 2015 dropped by 4.6%.",
        "July saw some signs of stabilisation in production and consumption decline.",
        "Yet, the energy price slump, highly volatile global financial markets, and a grim outlook for economic growth in emerging economies exacerbate the risks of economic cooling in Russia.",
        "While structural factors are still curbing economic growth, current drop in production is of a cyclical nature.",
        "This is evidenced by low consumer and business confidence, as well as reduced utilisation of production capacities.",
        "However, the negative demographic trends keep unemployment low, while the labour market is adjusting to the new conditions largely through wage cuts and wider part-time employment.",
        "These factors, along with low level of retail lending, will result in further contraction of consumer spending.",
        "Fixed capital investment is predicted to continue on their downward path, driven by negative business expectations with regard to Russia’s economic outlook and tight lending terms.",
        "Limited potential substitution of external finance with domestic one will be among the factors which, following the narrow nature of the Russian financial market and its high debt load, are likely to constrain investment demand.",
        "Still, investment is due to receive some support from the governmental anti-crisis programme.",
        "Weak investment and consumer activity will cause low demand for imports.",
        "Export volumes are expected to grow slightly, against the background of the floating exchange rate.",
        "As a result, net exports will be the only positive contributor to the annual output growth.",
        "Taking into account Q1 GDP data and the negative changes in external conditions, output is forecast to contract by 3.9-4.4% in 2015.",
        "Going forward, the economic situation will depend on the global energy prices and the economy’s ability to adjust to external shocks.",
        "As a baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia considers that the oil price will linger at about $50 for the next three years.",
        "In these conditions, a decline in quarterly GDP growth is expected to be more protracted than previously forecast.",
        "Weak domestic demand and the relatively tough monetary conditions will trigger annual inflation reduction in 2015-2017.",
        "A slowdown in the annual consumer price growth will create prerequisites for further decrease in inflation expectations.",
        "In early 2016, annual inflation is expected to slow considerably due to, among other factors, its high base of 2015.",
        "The Bank of Russia forecasts the annual consumer price growth to be about 7% in September 2016 and to reach the 4% target in 2017, facilitated by the ongoing monetary policy.",
        "Key sources of inflation risks include a further worsening of external climate, persistently high inflation expectations and the revised planned 2016-2017 rate and price growth in the regulated sector, while social payments will be indexed and the overall budget policy will be eased.",
        "Moving forward, the Bank of Russia will make decisions on its key rate based on the changing balance of inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling.",

        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, as of 27 April, annual consumer price growth rate stood at 16.5%.",
        "High rates of annual inflation are conditioned primarily by short-term factors: ruble depreciation in late 2014 — January 2015 and external trade restrictions.",
        "Meanwhile, monthly consumer price growth is estimated to have declined on the average to 1.0% in March-April from 3.1% in January-February, and annual inflation tends to stabilise.",
        "Lower consumer demand amid contracting real income and ruble appreciation in the recent months curbed prices.",

        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the labour market adjusts to the new conditions mostly through wage decrease and part-time employment.",
        "These factors, alongside with a decrease in retail lending, will result in further decline in consumer activity.",

        "Sluggish domestic demand will contain imports.",
        "Net exports will be the only factor to make a positive contribution to the output growth.",
        "These factors will lead to a fall in GDP in 2015.",
        "Later on, as import substitution expands, sources of funding gradually diversify, lending conditions ease, and oil prices rise to some extent, the quarter-on-quarter GDP growth is expected to recover.",

        "The ruble depreciation will further affect the prices of goods and services contributing to the likely increase in annual inflation in the next months.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation and inflation expectations are forecasted to decrease as the economy gradually adjusts to changing external conditions and the impact of the exchange rate dynamics on prices exhausts.",
        "Slowdown in consumer price growth will be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with total goods and services output remaining below the potential as well as by slightly tight fiscal policy.",

        "Seasonally adjusted monthly inflation was down from 0.9% between August and October to 0.7% in November.",
        "Consumer prices were rising slower thanks to the beneficial agricultural environment and a gradual exhaustion of the impact from the depreciation of the ruble of the July to August period, as well the weakness in consumer demand driven by low growth in nominal household incomes.",
        "The downturn in annual inflation is further explained by the sharp increase in consumer prices seen one year ago (the base effect).",

        "This decision will contribute to the reduction of these risks without posing an additional threat of increased inflationary pressure.",
        "According to Bank of Russia forecast, the current monetary policy and low economic activity will be conducive to the slowing of annual consumer price growth to 9% over the year (March 2016 on March 2015) and to the target of 4% in 2017.",

        "At the same time, short-term and inflation risks persist.",
        "The decline of inflation expectations has come to a halt, consistent with predictions, in response to price movements in a number of products and services.",
        "In order to maintain inflation close to the 4% target, the Bank of Russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy.",
        "The Bank of Russia sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017.",
        "While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions.",
        "Inflation remains close to the target.",
        "June saw a slight short-term rise in inflation to 4.4%, which came as a result of price movements in fruit and vegetables under the influence of bad weather conditions.",
        "At the same time, the trend towards sustainably low inflation remains in place.",
        "Growth rates of food product prices, but for fruit and vegetables, continued to slow, so did prices in the non-food product market and core inflation.",
        "Price growth rates continue to show consistency both across regions and in the consumer basket.",
        "This is reflected in the growing proportion of products and services posting price growth rates around 4%.",
        "In this environment, recovering consumer demand alongside the decline of its disinflationary effect brings no material risks.",
        "In the months ahead, as new harvest comes in, prices for fruit and vegetables are set to show a seasonal downward trend.",
        "Consistent with expectations, the seasonal rise in prices on individual food products brought about a temporary halt in the decline of household and corporate inflation expectations.",
        "Their performance could also have been impacted by the traditional rise in regulated prices and tariffs.",
        "The weakening of the ruble in June and July had no meaningful implications for annual inflation and inflation expectations, given its substantial strengthening observed since early this year.",
        "For inflation to become anchored close to the 4% target, sustainable decline in inflation expectations in required.",
        "The economic activity is rebounding.",
        "Positive trends in industrial production are gaining momentum, freight turnover is growing, and construction has turned to recovery.",
        "Growth in household consumption expenditures went up along with the increase in investment and production.",
        "A moderate increase in consumer spending is not adding inflationary pressure as the supply of goods and services expands.",
        "Annual GDP is to grow by 1.3-1.8%.",
        "At the same time, economic growth is nearing its potential level.",
        "It is constrained, among other things, by the situation in the labour market where shortages of labour force are already visible in some segments.",
        "Further GDP growth above 1.5-2% a year is attainable if structural reforms are put in place.",
        "Short-term inflation risks persist as regards harvest prospects and their impact on food prices and inflation expectations.",

        "The sources of medium-term risks remain unchanged.",
        "First, they are connected with further movements of oil prices which are lower than expected in the light of the agreements achieved.",
        "Legislative consolidation and implementation of the budget rule will mitigate these risks.",
        "Second, growth in the productivity of labour may lag considerably behind the wage growth as structural shortage of labour force aggravates.",

        "Fourth, inflation expectations remain sensitive to changing prices of individual groups of goods and services and exchange rate movements.",
        "Fifth, the likely tax manoeuvre may result in a temporary acceleration of inflation.",

        "According to the estimates as of 24 April, annual inflation stands at 4.2-4.3%.",
        "March saw a slowdown in price growth across all core groups of goods and services.",
        "Inflation slowdown was broadly facilitated by the ruble appreciation amid relatively higher oil prices, persistent interest in investment in Russian assets among external investors, and a drop in the sovereign risk premium.",
        "Seasonally adjusted monthly inflation data in February and March held at a low level.",
        "These months saw food inflation unusually low for this period, supported by the high level of supply including bumper harvests of 2015-2016.",
        "This impact is likely to run its course in the second quarter, which is attested by weekly price growth data for April that suggests that prices on fruit and vegetables accelerated.",
        "Even so, inflation is estimated to remain on the path of downward movement towards the 4% target before the end of 2017.",
        "As inflation showed a substantial slowdown in 2017 Q1, inflation expectations of both households and businesses were down considerably.",

        "Polling data reflects an improvement in business and household sentiments, supporting favourable economic dynamics.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the observed annual rise in real wages will foster gradual growth in consumer activity without posing additional proinflationary pressure amid increased supply of goods and services.",
        "Given the current recovery dynamics and the economy’s growing resilience to the fluctuations in the external economic climate, the Bank of Russia expects that the GDP will grow in 2017-2019 even if the conservative oil price scenario materialises.",
        "Possible volatility of global commodity and financial markets caused, among other things, by negotiations between oil exporting countries to extend agreements on limiting oil production may become the key source of inflation risks in the near future.",
        "It may result in a temporary hike in volatility of capital flows and the exchange rate undermining exchange rate and inflation expectations.",
        "That said, inflation risks will be lower in the scenario with rising oil prices.",

        "Besides, medium-term inflation risks are that anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations at the target level may take a long time.",

        "On the short-term horizon, among these factors are food price movements triggered by the supply of farm produce.",

        "Moving forward, the Bank of Russia’s key rate decisions will be based on its assessment on the balance of risks for inflation significantly and persistently deviating in either direction from the target, as well as the dynamics of economic activity against the forecast.",
        "The Bank of Russia Board of Directors leaves open the option of further rate reduction at its upcoming meetings.",
        "On 3 February 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.00% p.a.",
        "The Board of Directors points out that inflation performance has been in line with the forecast, inflation expectations are going down gradually, and the economy is recovering faster than previously expected.",
        "However, the slower growth of consumer prices is partially attributed to temporary factors.",
        "The purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market, which Russia’s Finance Ministry intends to carry out under a transitional budget rule, will not bring considerable inflation risks given the Bank of Russia sticks to its moderately tight monetary policy.",
        "Inflation is to slow down to the 4% target by late 2017 and hold close to this level in the sequel.",
        "Given the internal and external developments, the Bank of Russia’s capability to cut its key rate in the first half of 2017 has diminished.",
        "In its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions.",
        "Annual inflation continues to decline in line with the Bank of Russia’s forecast.",
        "This is partially attributed to temporary factors — the ruble exchange rate and last year’s heavy crop.",
        "December saw a further slowdown in growth of prices for staple goods and services, as well as lower monthly inflation (seasonally adjusted).",
        "Non-food inflation slowed down considerably.",
        "According to the estimates as of 30 January, annual consumer price growth was down from 5.4% in 2016 to 5.1%.",
        "Domestic demand continues to exert a disinflationary effect.",
        "Households are retaining their savings behaviour model, although their sentiment improved.",
        "Consumer lending bears no inflation risks.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s forecast suggests that given today’s decision and extension of moderately tight monetary policy, annual inflation is to slow down to the 4% target by late 2017 and hold close to this level in the sequel.",
        "Positive real interest rates will be held at the level which will ensure demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and uphold incentives for saving.",
        "The Bank of Russia will manage banking sector liquidity with due account taken for the Finance Ministry’s purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market and their effect on the money market rates will be almost immaterial.",
        "The inertia of inflation expectations and households’ shrinking propensity to save may prevent inflation from consolidating on the path towards the target as the effect of temporary factors comes to an end.",
        "External political and economic uncertainty remains elevated, which may negatively affect expectations as regards exchange rate and inflation.",
        "Maintenance of moderately tight monetary conditions will constrain inflation risks, including the short-term ones, coming from the launch of the Finance Ministry-conducted purchase of foreign currency in the FX market.",
        "Having said that, the application of the transitional budget rule, accompanied with the Finance Ministry-conducted purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market will help lower the dependence of the Russian economy, particularly in terms of monetary conditions and inflation dynamics, on fluctuating oil prices.",
        "In the medium term, the application of the budget rule will help bring about macroeconomic stability and more predictable and steadier interest rates in the economy.",
        "Considering the change in the external and internal environment, the Bank of Russia’s capability to downgrade its key rate in the course of the first half of 2017 has diminished.",

        "While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions.",
        "Annual inflation stood at 4.1% in May keeping close to the target.",
        "Low inflation is gradually gaining sustainability.",
        "Price growth becomes more homogeneous in regions and for major groups of goods and services.",
        "Growth in prices for non-food goods and services continued to decline.",
        "Food inflation remains relatively low, although since the supply of last year harvest has become exhausted annual growth in prices for fruit and vegetables is currently rising.",
        "Annual inflation registered an expected short-term increase against this backdrop standing at an estimated 4.2% as of 13 June 2017.",
        "As inflation showed a substantial slowdown, inflation expectations of both households and businesses declined considerably.",
        "This trend, however, may temporarily come to a halt amid the seasonal rise in prices for certain types of fruit and vegetables, considering that inflation expectations are sensitive to their dynamics.",
        "Inflation expectations should be lowered further to anchor inflation close to 4%.",
        "Domestic demand continues to exert a disinflationary impact.",
        "Households broadly tend to demonstrate savings behaviour patterns.",
        "There are signs of nascent recovery in consumer activity.",
        "Consumer lending creates no significant inflation risks so far.",
        "Ruble appreciation made a considerable contribution to consumer price growth slowdown since the start of the year.",
        "This factor’s influence on inflation is abating amid the relatively stable exchange rate.",
        "Moderately tight monetary conditions played an important role in slowing down inflation.",
        "Against the backdrop of the key rate reduction interest rates on loans have dropped.",
        "Their level supports balanced demand for loans.",
        "Consumption recovery is not outpacing growth in wages for the time being.",
        "Banks continue to adhere to a conservative policy by mitigating price and non-price lending conditions primarily for reliable borrowers.",
        "The slowing growth in household deposits was attributable in part to the deposit rate reduction.",
        "The Bank of Russia will set the monetary conditions to promote savings, which in turn will curb inflation risks.",
        "Economic activity continues to recover.",
        "Household consumption is on the rise alongside with the growth in investment and industrial output.",
        "Currently, a moderate growth in consumer expenditures does not exert any inflationary pressure under increased supply of goods and services.",
        "Considering the current recovery trends, the Bank of Russia has increased its GDP growth rate forecast to 1.3-1.8% in 2017.",
        "Economic growth is getting closer to its potential level.",
        "The situation in the labour market with the shortage of personnel in certain segments being evident is a constraint.",
        "In the sequel a GDP growth rate higher than 1.5-2% annually will be reached if structural reforms take place.",
        "Mid-term risks remain elevated.",
        "First, they are connected with the further dynamics of oil prices which under reached the agreements began to take shape at a lower level than expected.",
        "Legislative consolidation of a budget rule will contribute to mitigating this risk.",
        "Second, a higher structural deficit of labour resources can produce a situation when labour productivity growth rates will be left significantly behind the growth in wages.",
        "Third, a change in the household behaviour model connected with a substantial decrease in their propensity to save can be a source of inflationary pressure.",
        "Fourth, the sensitivity of inflation expectations to price changes for certain groups of goods and services and in the exchange rate dynamics is still present.",
        "Fifth, a possible tax manoeuvre can lead to a temporary acceleration in inflation.",
        "Considering these factors the maintenance of moderately tight monetary conditions for a long period of time to anchor inflation close to its target will be required.",
        "The Bank of Russia sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017.",
        "While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast.",

        "Inflation risks have slightly dropped but remain elevated.",
        "In these circumstances, given the moderately tight monetary policy, the 4% inflation target will be achieved by the end of 2017 and will be maintained at this level further.",
        "While assessing evolving inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of cutting the key rate gradually in coming Q2-Q3.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors.",
        "Inflation declines ahead of the forecast.",
        "Over the first twenty days in March, annual consumer price growth dropped to an estimated 4.3%, from 5.0% in January 2017.",
        "February saw a continued slowdown in price growth across all key groups of goods and services, and a reduction in seasonally adjusted monthly inflation.",
        "Inflation slowdown was broadly facilitated by the ruble appreciation amid higher than expected oil prices, persistent interest in investment in Russian assets among external investors, and a drop in the sovereign risk premium.",
        "Bumper harvests of 2015-2016 resulted in high stocks of agricultural products, leading to a material slowdown in food inflation and falling vegetable and fruit prices.",
        "Disinflationary drag from domestic demand persists.",
        "Households broadly tend to demonstrate savings behaviour patterns.",
        "There are signs of revival in consumption and wages are growing both in nominal and real terms.",
        "Consumer lending dynamics does not pose any risks for inflation.",
        "Noticeable inflation deceleration will be conducive to a further reduction in inflation expectations among households and businesses.",
        "Given the decision taken and persistent moderately tight monetary policy, the Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual consumer price growth will reduce to 4% by the end of 2017 and will remain within this target range in 2018-2019.",
        "In order to maintain the propensity to save and anchor sustainable inflation slowdown driven by demand-side restrictions, monetary conditions should remain moderately tight.",
        "Positive real interest rates will be held at the level which will ensure demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and will uphold incentives for saving.",
        "A gradual decline in nominal interest rates and the easing of non-price bank lending conditions will remain.",
        "Given banks’ conservative policy stance, these trends will mostly influence high-quality borrowers.",
        "The Finance Ministry’s purchases of foreign currency in the FX market did not have any substantial impact on the ruble exchange rate dynamics as the driving factors of its appreciation remained dominant.",
        "Short-term inflation risks related to these operations did not materialise.",
        "The pace of economic recovery is higher than expected.",
        "Estimates show that quarterly GDP has been going up since 2016 Q2 and the trend is set to continue.",
        "January — February 2017 saw an ongoing annual industrial production growth (adjusted for calendar factors) and a gradual rebound in investment activity.",
        "Fixed capital investment is expected to advance in Q1.",
        "Unemployment remains persistently low.",
        "The labour market is adapting to the new economic conditions with occasional signs of labour shortages in certain segments.",
        "Recovery is becoming more even across the regions.",
        "Polling data reflects an improvement in business and household sentiment, conducive to favourable economic dynamics.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the observed annual rise in real wages fosters gradual growth in consumer activity without posing an additional proinflationary pressure amid increased supply of goods and services.",
        "The Bank of Russia takes into consideration the oil market uncertainty and keeps pursuing a conservative approach to the forecast, which assumes an oil price reduction to $40 per barrel by the end of 2017 and its further staying near this level.",
        "GDP is expected to grow by 1-1.5% in 2017 and by 1-2% in 2018-2019 considering the current dynamics of recovery processes and higher economy resilience to fluctuations in external economic environment.",
        "It takes structural changes and time for positive trends to evolve and take root.",
        "The risks that inflation will miss the 4% target by the end of 2017 have slightly abated.",
        "Nevertheless, there are still risks that inflation may fail to anchor at the target level in the medium run.",
        "These risks are implied by the inertia of inflation expectations, as well as a possible rapid decline in households’ propensity to save.",
        "Volatility in the global commodity and financial markets may weigh negatively on expectations with regard to exchange rate and inflation.",
        "The said risks may also materialise over the horizon.",

        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the factors as follows.",
        "Inflation stays close to 4%.",
        "In August, inflation totalled 3.3% following a short-lived rise to 4.4% in June.",
        "Inflation continues to decline in the non-food goods market; services price growth has stabilised around 4%.",
        "High homogeneity of inflation is maintained for consumer basket and across regions.",
        "Food price growth decelerates due to the seasonal cheapening of vegetables and fruit, which has exceeded preliminary estimates.",
        "As inflation becomes lower, the contribution of volatile components, consisting of vegetable and fruit prices, among other things, to the general movement of the consumer price index becomes more pronounced.",
        "During 2018 short-term factors may cause inflation to deviate from the 4% both to the upside and to the downside.",
        "Noticeable changes in the prices for the consumer goods and services most often purchased by the population feed through to inflation expectations dynamics rather quickly.",
        "To keep inflation close to 4%, it is necessary to make inflation expectations less sensitive to price movements.",
        "Monetary stance continues to support household propensity to save amid elevated economic activity and recovery in current incomes.",
        "Real bank rates remain in positive territory.",
        "Nominal lending rates continue to decline influenced by earlier key rate cuts, as well as those expected by market participants.",
        "Banks tend to ease non-price lending conditions on a case-by-case basis and continue to thoroughly select borrowers.",
        "Conservative approach employed by banks, coupled by moderately tight monetary policy, shapes conditions required for anchoring inflation close to 4% and for the further reduction in inflation expectations.",
        "In Q2, GDP growth exceeded the forecast figures.",
        "Economic growth was spurred by investment and consumer demand along with the recovery of production inventories.",
        "Higher consumer demand under current monetary conditions does not pose significant inflation risks amid the expanding supply of goods and services.",
        "Q2 saw further growth in manufacturing output; construction began to rise.",
        "Trade, mining and transport made a major contribution to the accelerating economic growth.",
        "Certain industries experienced faster growth due to both persistent and one-off factors that will most likely have less influence during the next six months, which is in part supported by July statistics.",
        "In view of the positive trend set by Q2, the forecast for GDP growth in 2017 has been revised upwards to 1.7-2.2%.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s assessment of the medium-term economic development remains the same.",
        "The economy is close to its potential.",
        "Growth might be constrained by insufficient production capacity together with the possible skilled labour shortages affecting certain segments of the labour market.",
        "Further GDP growth above 1.5-2% a year is attainable if structural reforms are put in place.",
        "Medium-term risks of inflation overshooting 4% dominate over the risk of its steady downward deviation from the target.",
        "Fluctuations of food prices will remain the source of inflation volatility over the next six months.",
        "Food price dynamics will depend on the quality and preserved volumes of the harvest.",
        "Short-term food market factors might trigger temporary deviation of inflation (both upward and downward) from the 4%, which, however, will not persist.",
        "Key sources of medium-term inflation risks remain unchanged.",
        "First, there are potential price fluctuations in global commodity markets.",
        "Implementation of the budget rule will reduce risks linked to oil price movements.",
        "Second, labour productivity growth may lag considerably behind the wage growth as the structural shortage of labour force aggravates.",
        "Third, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households’ behaviour as the propensity to save becomes much lower.",
        "Fourth, inflation expectations remain highly sensitive to changing prices for individual groups of goods and services and exchange rate movements.",
        "These factors call for moderately tight monetary conditions to be kept in place in order to anchor inflation close to the target.",
        "During the next two quarters, the Bank of Russia deems it possible to cut the key rate further.",

        "Inflation holds at 2.5% and will gradually draw near 4% by late 2018.",
        "The extension of the agreement to reduce oil production brings pro-inflationary risks down over a one-year horizon.",
        "In recognition of this, the Bank of Russia cut its key rate by 50 basis points.",
        "Medium-term pro-inflationary risks still prevail over the risks of inflation’s sustainable deviation downward from the target.",

        "The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of some key rate reduction in the first half of 2018.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors.",
        "Under the impact of temporary factors annual inflation holds below 3%.",
        "It is estimated at 2.5% as of 11 December 2017.",
        "In 2017 Q4, increased supply of farm produce on the back of growing crop productivity and the shortage of long-term storage facilities continued to exert a downward pressure on consumer price growth.",
        "As a result, annual food inflation fell to 1.1% in November 2017.",
        "The majority of factors associated with the 2017 harvest will cease to have a disinflationary influence in the first half of 2018.",
        "The contribution of the exchange rate dynamics to annual inflation slowdown diminishes and will be exhausted in 2018 Q1.",
        "Annual growth in prices of non-food products, which stood at 2.7% in November, is observed to decline, while services prices went up by 4.2% over the year.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the majority of annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are somewhat below 4%.",
        "The slowdown of inflation was conducive to a decline in inflation expectations, which nevertheless remains unstable and uneven.",
        "The anchoring of inflation close to 4% will require both further decrease in inflation expectations and making them less susceptible to price changes.",
        "Annual inflation is expected to be under 3% in late 2017 and come close to 4% by late 2018 as the impact of temporary factors is exhausted.",
        "The key rate decision and the potential for its decrease in the future will contribute to further easing of monetary conditions, thus creating prerequisites for inflation to approach 4%.",
        "While nominal bank rates keep declining, real bank rates remain in the positive territory.",
        "Non-price lending conditions are gradually becoming looser for the most reliable borrowers but are still restrictive.",
        "In the course of the transition to neutral monetary policy, the shape of the yield curve will continue to change from inverted to normal.",
        "Given the situation, the potential for lowering the short-term rates is greater than for the long-term ones.",
        "The current conditions continue to encourage savings and ensure that consumption growth is balanced.",
        "These trends will persist amid further gradual easing of the monetary policy and low risk appetite of lenders and borrowers.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, at the end of 2017, the economy’s growth rate will be close to the potential at 1.7-2.2%.",
        "Therefore, monetary conditions generate low inflationary pressure without restricting economic growth.",
        "Although October saw inconsistent trends in the dynamics of economic activity, producer sentiment remains at a relatively high level.",
        "It will be further supported by growing domestic demand amid higher real wages as well as by the recovery of the global economy.",
        "Unemployment does not generate any excessive inflationary pressure.",
        "In view of the extension of the agreement to reduce oil production, the Bank of Russia has raised its GDP growth forecast for 2018 in comparison to the previous baseline scenario.",
        "However, the medium-term prospects of the Russian economy saw no changes.",
        "Over the forecast horizon, economic growth will not exceed 1.5-2.0%, which corresponds to the current estimates of its potential level.",
        "Depending on the situation, a number of factors may cause inflation to deviate from the target both upwards and downwards.",
        "They include the dynamics of food and oil prices, which are characterised by high volatility.",
        "The fiscal rule will set off the impact of the oil market conditions on inflation and the domestic economic environment as a whole.",
        "At the same time, certain factors generate mostly pro-inflationary risks: this includes the situation in the labour market, potential changes in the consumer behaviour, and the nature of inflation expectations.",
        "The extension of the agreement between oil-exporting countries lowers the uncertainty of energy prices’ dynamics and related pro-inflationary risks over a one-year horizon.",
        "However, the risks of upward deviation of inflation from the forecast in the medium term still prevail.",
        "First, increased structural labour shortage may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth.",
        "Second, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households’ behaviour as the propensity to save becomes much lower.",
        "Third, inflation expectations remain elevated and subject to fluctuations caused by movements in prices of certain goods and services and the exchange rate.",
        "Besides, the medium-term balance of risks for inflation dynamics will depend on potential budgetary and tariff decisions in 2019–2020.",
        "The Bank of Russia will also monitor risks posed by external factors all over the forecast horizon.",
        "Moving forward, the Bank of Russia’s key rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the balance of risks of inflation’s material and sustainable deviation in either direction from the target, as well as the dynamics of economic activity against the forecast.",

        "In this context lending expansion continued.",

        "This is less than the Bank of Russia expected earlier.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia’s estimates, economic recovery also continued in 2020 Q4.",
        "The constraining effect of the worsening epidemic situation on the economy in Russia and worldwide was much less than expected.",
        "This is related to the targeted nature of restrictive measures and the significant adaptation of households and businesses to the new conditions.",
        "In 2020 Q4, households’ real income continued to recover and unemployment started to decline.",
        "High-frequency indicators of economic activity suggest that the economic recovery in early 2021 is ongoing.",

        "The medium-term economic growth path will be largely influenced by further coronavirus pandemic developments in Russia and globally, the nature of the recovery of private demand in the context of potential change in consumer and business behaviour, as well as by the path of budget consolidation.",
        "Accommodative monetary policy will continue to support the economy throughout 2021.",
        "Disinflationary risks no longer prevail over the horizon of 2021.",
        "The impact of proinflationary factors may prove more protracted and pronounced against the backdrop of a faster recovery in demand as well as previous growth in inflation expectations and the associated secondary effects.",
        "Upward pressure on prices may be caused by temporary disruptions in production and supply chains in the post-restriction period, as well as by additional corporate costs of protecting staff and consumers from the spread of the pandemic.",
        "Proinflationary risks are generated by domestic prices for certain food products, affected by supply-side factors and the environment in the related global markets.",
        "Short-term proinflationary risks are also connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations.",
        "Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible.",
        "This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets.",
        "Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly grounded in a weaker recovery in demand in Russia and globally.",
        "The economic recovery may be slowed down by the spread of new coronavirus strains and lower than expected paces of vaccination, among other things, as well as a tightening of restrictive measures.",
        "Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour, including a persistent higher propensity to save, and a slower recovery of household incomes might also exert a constraining influence on inflation.",
        "Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market through inflows of foreign labour force.",

        "Potential global growth may also come under marked pressure from geopolitical factors including rising trade conflicts.",

        "A trend towards growth in deposit interest rates is also emerging.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s decisions to increase the key rate and the rise in OFZ yields observed since the beginning of the year will create prerequisites for further growth in loan and deposit rates.",

        "Bank of Russia estimates suggest that in these conditions the Russian economy will recover to pre-crisis levels as soon as 2021 Q2.",
        "The medium-term path of economic growth will largely depend both on domestic and external conditions.",
        "Domestic demand movements will be predominantly shaped by the rate of growth in consumer and investment demand.",
        "Consumer demand will be supported by a further decline in households’ propensity to save along with an increase in incomes and lending.",
        "Domestic demand will also be influenced by the process of fiscal policy normalisation in view of the announced additional social and infrastructural measures.",
        "External demand movements will be mostly dependent on fiscal support measures in individual advanced economies as well as the pace of vaccination world-wide.",
        "Inflationary pressures may originate from a stronger-than-expected decline in households’ propensity to save, propelled by the combination of low interest rates and growing prices.",
        "Further upward pressure on prices may continue to come from remaining disruptions in production and supply chains.",

        "At the same time, further movements of food prices will largely depend on agricultural harvest prospects both in Russia and abroad.",
        "Short-term proinflationary risks are also associated with the stronger volatility in global markets caused in part by various geopolitical developments, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations.",
        "Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible.",

        "Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate.",
        "Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force.",

        "The acceleration in annual inflation since the second half of August comes in many ways as a result of rising fruit and vegetable prices.",
        "However, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements appreciably exceed 4% (annualised), Bank of Russia estimates show.",
        "This largely reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors.",
        "In this context, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global prices, on to consumers.",
        "At the same time, the impact of one-off supply-side drivers of inflation translates into growing prices for a wider range of goods and services as inflation expectations of households and businesses remain high and unanchored.",

        "At the end of 2018, inflation is expected to be close to 4%, which corresponds to the Bank of Russia’s target.",
        "In November, the annual consumer price growth rose to 3.8% (3.9%, according to the estimates as of 10 December).",
        "This November’s upward movement of inflation was largely driven by annual food price growth accelerating from 2.7% to 3.5%.",
        "This was supported by changes in the balance of supply and demand in certain food markets.",
        "Prices are further adjusting to the ruble exchange rate that has weakened since the beginning of the year.",

        "Inflation remains below 4% longer than expected, allowing for a quicker transition to neutral monetary policy this year.",
        "Factors, previously seen as mostly temporary, are becoming more persistent under the influence of the following structural changes.",
        "First, investments in agriculture and an increase in its production capacity reduce harvest’s dependence on weather conditions and have a restraining influence on food price growth.",
        "Second, the implementation of the budget rule lowers the sensitivity of domestic economic conditions, including exchange rate and inflation dynamics, to changes in oil prices.",
        "These developments make the stabilisation of inflation at low levels more sustainable and reduce the risks of significant fluctuations.",
        "Current consumer price dynamics favour a decrease in inflation expectations of households and businesses, further contributing to keeping inflation at bay.",

        "The increase in mortgage and consumer lending does not pose any risks for inflation to rise above 4% so far.",

        "Annual inflation is returning to 4% faster than expected.",
        "Annual consumer price growth increased to 3.1% in August, which is slightly higher than the upper bound of the Bank of Russia forecast.",
        "The upward movement of inflation in August is related to the increase in annual food price growth to 1.9%.",
        "This was supported by changes in the balance of supply and demand in certain food markets and the past year’s low base effect.",
        "Also, prices are adjusting to the ruble exchange rate that has weakened since the beginning of the year.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, most annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are growing.",
        "Inflation expectations of both households and businesses have slightly increased on the back of the foreign exchange rate volatility.",
        "According to the monitoring data of the Bank of Russia, some businesses may adjust their prices in line with the scheduled VAT increase already in late 2018.",
        "The ruble’s depreciation is related to capital outflow due to changes in external conditions.",
        "At the same time, the current account balance remains high thanks to stable prices of Russian export goods and significantly exceeds the amount of external debt repayments scheduled for the coming months.",
        "In this context, the Bank of Russia’s decision to suspend foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule will serve to curtail exchange rate volatility and its influence on inflation over the next few quarters.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia forecast that takes into account the decisions taken with regard to the key rate and to the suspension of foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule, by the end of 2018 the consumer price growth rate will be 3.8-4.2%.",
        "Annual inflation will peak in the first six months of 2019 reaching 5.0-5.5% by the end of 2019.",

        "The Bank of Russia still assumes that monetary policy will become neutral in 2018.",
        "At the same time, the Bank of Russia considers that the potential key rate reduction intended to bring about neutral monetary conditions has decreased given the rise in interest rates across advanced economies and country risk premium growth for Russia.",
        "Moving forward, in its decision-making the Bank of Russia will be guided by assessments of inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors.",
        "Inflation remains low, driven by long-term factors including, in the first place, a moderate recovery in domestic demand.",
        "Consumer prices grew at the pace of 2.4% in March, and consumer price growth in April is estimated at 2.3 2.5%.",
        "The recent weekly data on inflation are indicative of a still feeble response of consumer prices to the ruble weakening.",
        "The gradual depletion of the past year’s vegetable stocks and the related growth in imports contributed to an expected slight increase in both monthly and annual inflation between March and April, relative to February.",
        "In March, household inflation expectations dropped to a historical low of 7.8%.",
        "That said, uncertainty is in place over how inflation expectations will respond to the April developments in financial markets.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates that the ruble weakening will quicken inflation movement to 4% without the risks of overpassing this level, unless the external environment changes considerably.",
        "Inflation is forecast to range between 3 4% as of the end of 2018 and hold close to 4% in 2019.",
        "The Bank of Russia’s estimates suggest that the potential for key rate reduction to shape neutral monetary conditions shrank somewhat.",
        "As the country risk premium increased and interest rates were revised upwards in advanced economies, the estimated neutral interest rate has shifted closer to its upper bound within the range of 6 7%.",
        "Business activity keeps on expanding and is hardly posing any disinflationary pressure on consumer price movements.",
        "This paves the way for inflation to return to 4%.",

        "In April and May, the annual consumer price growth rate remained at the March level totalling 2.4%.",
        "Inflation for main consumer basket product groups showed mixed dynamics.",
        "On the one hand, amid growing global oil prices coupled with the increase in excises early this year, the prices of oil products in the domestic market saw a tangible rise.",
        "This factor was the key contributor to the growth of annual inflation for non-food goods up to 3.4% in May (vs 2.7% in April).",
        "The adopted decision to lower the excises for oil products from 1 June 2018 will help to slow down the price growth for this product group by the end of this year.",
        "On the other hand, fruit and vegetable prices saw a substantial decline, which led to the drop in annual food inflation to 0.4% in May (vs 1.1% in April).",
        "This is related to continuing high supply of food products.",
        "Inflation expectations of households and businesses saw a slight increase, which is primarily related to higher petrol prices.",
        "The weakening of ruble exchange rate in April moderately affects the dynamics of inflation and inflation expectations.",

        "Monetary conditions are being formed, among other things, under the influence of earlier decisions to lower the key rate.",
        "At the same time, the conservative approach of banks to selecting borrowers encourages a gradual increase in credit without creating risks to price and financial stability.",
        "Deposits remain attractive for households at the current interest rate levels.",
        "Taking into account the impact of the suggested fiscal measures on inflation and inflation expectations, the transition to neutral monetary policy needs to be slower.",
        "Keeping somewhat tight monetary conditions allows to limit the scale of secondary effects arising from the tax policy decisions and stabilise annual inflation close to 4%.",
        "2018 Q1 annual GDP growth was slightly below the March forecast, totalling 1.3%.",
        "This resulted from a slower than expected growth of fixed capital investment, including a decline in construction, together with the review of the data for 2017 by Rosstat.",

        "The time period since the Bank of Russia Board meeting in December saw risks to price stability escalating.",
        "The stubborn glut of oil, the slowing Chinese economy, combined with the US Federal Reserve rate hike, have triggered a further drop in the price of crude.",
        "This, in its turn, caused the national currencies to weaken and asset prices to drop in emerging markets, affecting Russia.",
        "With more volatility in oil prices, the magnitude of variation in Russian financial asset prices and the ruble exchange rate fluctuation has increased.",
        "The recent weakening of the ruble is putting pro-inflationary pressure and causes inflation expectations to grow, despite a slowdown in annual inflation.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the annual growth rate of consumer prices is set to drop from 12.9% for December 2015 to approximately 10% for January 2016.",
        "This slowdown in annual inflation is in line with the previous forecasts.",
        "The Bank of Russia expects consumer prices in 1Q 2016 to grow 8-9% against the same period last year.",
        "There are risks that inflation in 2Q 2016 may accelerate, caused by, among other factors, the low base effect.",
        "Thereafter, annual consumer price growth rate is set to resume its decline.",
        "This should occur on the back of, inter alia, reduced inflation expectations and the Bank of Russia’s monetary policy.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia estimate, on the strength of today’s decision, inflation is set to decrease to a point below 7% as early as January 2017 so it reaches the 4% target by late 2017.",
        "However, the risks have grown that inflation may deviate from the target in late 2017.",
        "The key rate decision has been made in recognition of the current economic situation, with elevated risks of continued recession provoked by falling oil prices.",
        "The high debt load of Russian companies and interest rate risks for banks and their borrowers have also been factored in.",
        "In 2016-2017, oil prices are likely to be lower than forecast previously in the baseline scenario.",
        "The floating exchange rate will partially offset the negative impact of energy prices on the economy.",
        "However, the balance of payments and the economy will have to be further adjusted to lower global prices for the key Russian exports.",
        "This will result in a more sizable GDP contraction in 2016 than forecast previously in the baseline scenario.",
        "The additional adjustment may take several quarters.",
        "The GDP growth rate will enter positive territory in 2017, but will be low.",
        "However, should oil prices remain persistently low, this will further escalate inflation and financial stability risks and will require a more extensive adjustment of the economy to the new conditions.",
        "A continued persistence of high inflation expectations may also hamper the slowdown of consumer price growth.",
        "A well-balanced fiscal policy will be required to mitigate these risks in the medium term.",

        "The Board of Directors notes that the dynamics of inflation and economic activity are overall in line with the forecast.",
        "At the same time, inflation is slowing down to a great extent on the back of temporary factors, while deceleration in inflation expectations remains unsteady.",
        "For the trend towards inflation slowdown to become sustainable, according to Bank of Russia estimates, it is necessary to hold the current key rate throughout 2016, with its potential downgrades due in 2017 Q1-Q2.",
        "Given this decision and considering that the moderately tight monetary policy is maintained, annual growth in consumer prices is set to total less than 4.5% for October 2017, dropping to the target level of 4% by the end of 2017.",
        "When making its key rate decisions in the months ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside with the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with the baseline forecast.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors was guided by the following considerations: First.",
        "Annual inflation continues its decline in line with the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast; however, this is largely due to temporary factors.",
        "Estimates as of 24 October indicate that annual consumer price growth was down to 6.2% from 6.4% seen in September.",
        "A meaningful contribution to the inflation reduction is made by the performance of the ruble exchange rate as oil prices have been higher than expected and Russian financial assets are becoming more attractive to external investors.",
        "Also, the good harvest helped lower food price growth.",
        "The disinflationary impact of domestic demand is however going down, which translates into slower deceleration of non-food product prices.",
        "Households have thus far been abiding by a saving-oriented model of behaviour.",
        "However, tentative signs of rising real wages may contribute to a gradual recovery in demand for goods and services.",
        "The key rate held at the current level long enough is expected to determine monetary conditions further on, which are critical to support incentives to save and shore up the trend towards sustainable inflation reduction, impacted by demand-side constraints.",
        "This will enable a further decline in inflation expectations.",
        "Considering the decision made and the maintenance of moderately tight monetary policy, the Bank of Russia forecasts that annual inflation will stand at less than 4.5% in October 2017, thereafter reaching the 4% target by late 2017.",
        "The further path of the key rate outlined by the Bank of Russia in September sought to adjust expectations of market participants, who forecast faster key rate reduction and slower inflation decline than predicted by the Bank of Russia.",
        "The announcement shifted the yield curve upwards in the financial market and preserved moderately tight monetary conditions.",
        "However, inflation expectations of market actors for late 2017 hold above the Bank of Russia’s 4% inflation target.",
        "The correction of the level of interest rates in the financial market was responsible for preserving moderately tight monetary conditions, expected to remain in the economy long enough.",
        "Positive real interest rates will be held at a level which, while securing demand for credit, will exclude heightened inflationary pressure and keep incentives to save.",
        "Tentative signs of recovery in consumer lending do not bear substantial inflation risks so far given that a considerable part of current loans is used to refinance previously extended loans.",
        "The revival of production remains unstable and varies across industries and regions.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates that moderately tight monetary conditions do not hinder economic recovery, with structural factors being the main restrictions.",

        "In 2017, economic growth will be low (under 1%).",
        "This forecast is based on conservative assumptions about low growth of the global economy, average oil prices of about restrictions of Russian economic development.",
        "Risks remain that the 4% inflation target may not be reached in 2017.",
        "This mainly results from inertial inflation expectations, possible weakening of households’ propensity to save, and higher real wages not supported with a rise in labour productivity.",

        "By estimates, the annual consumer price growth fell to 6.6% as of 12 September 2016 compared to 7.2% in July.",
        "However, the inflation slowdown was specifically shaped by the ruble dynamics amid more favourable external economic environment than expected earlier.",
        "The reluctant slowing in non-food goods price growth observed at this juncture signals the weakening in the disinflationary effects on the part of the domestic demand.",
        "Over recent months, seasonally smoothed indicators of consumer price monthly growth remained elevated.",
        "Keeping the key rate at 10.00 % p.a.",
        "during a rather long period of time will shape monetary conditions conducive for the trend towards a further persistent slowdown in inflation under the influence of demand-side constraints.",
        "Ruble stabilisation and the good harvest outlook will also contribute to lowering consumer price growth.",
        "This will install conditions for a further drop in inflation expectations.",
        "Considering the decision made and persistent moderately tight monetary policy, the annual inflation, as forecast by the Bank of Russia, will be around 4.5% in September 2017 to reach the 4% target by late 2017.",
        "The Bank of Russia expects that the decision made and maintenance of the key rate at the level it reached will bring down inflation expectations.",
        "At present, the structure of market interest rates by maturity and survey findings indicate that, in contrast to the Bank of Russia, market players forecast a faster drop in interest rates.",
        "Additionally, their end-2017 inflation forecasts exceed the 4% target of the central bank.",
        "In reality, the decrease of nominal rates has a limited capacity, and the economy will maintain moderately tight monetary conditions for quite a long period of time.",
        "This is implied by the need to keep positive real interest rates at the level supporting demand for credit that does not raise inflationary pressure and keeps incentives for saving.",
        "Persistent revival in production activity is still unstable and patchy across industries and regions.",
        "According to Bank of Russia estimates, the moderately tight monetary conditions do not hamper recovery in economy, whereas the main obstacles are caused by structural effects.",

        "At the same time, inflation risks remain elevated.",
        "These risks primarily stem from slowly declining inflation expectations against the target, uncertainty in parameters of the national budget, and ambiguity of the observed movements in nominal wages.",

        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors.",
        "Inflation fell perceptibly; however, the trend bears risks of instability.",
        "Slower consumer price growth is triggered by weak demand and gradually descending inflation expectations, driven by, inter alia, the moderately tight monetary policy.",
        "Meanwhile, the factors, which are likely to have a temporary impact, have also made a considerable contribution to inflation reduction.",
        "They include the Government’s decisions on indexation of wages, pensions, administrated prices and tariffs, as well as a drop in global food prices.",
        "Under the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual consumer price growth rate is down to 7.3% as of 25 April 2016 / as of 25 April 2016 remained at the level of March 2016 of 7.3%.",
        "This is in line with the inflation forecast for the year ahead, which the Bank of Russia published in its April 2015 press release (below 8%).",
        "In mid-2016, the annual consumer price growth is likely to accelerate temporarily owing to the low-base effect of the previous year.",
        "However, further on inflation will continue to go down.",
        "The Bank of Russia predicts, consistent with the decision, the annual inflation to stand at about 5% in April 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "Key macroeconomic indicators show higher resistance of the Russian economy to fluctuations in oil prices.",
        "The floating exchange rate partially sets off the negative impact of external shocks.",

        "The on-going shifts in the economy anticipate the beginning of its recovery growth.",
        "Quarterly GDP growth is expected to reach positive territory in 2016 H2 — early 2017.",
        "Interest rates in the economy are set to decline further even with the key rate unchanged.",
        "This is mainly driven by the planned Reserve Fund spending to finance the budget deficit and the ensuing changeover in the banking sector to a liquidity surplus.",
        "There remain elevated inflation risks.",
        "These primarily stem from slowly declining inflation expectations against the inflation target, mixed data on movements being observed in nominal wages, uncertainty in parameters of further wages and pensions indexation, and from the absence of budget consolidation strategy.",
        "Due to the continued supply glut in the oil market, the risks of crude prices dropping and their negative pressure on exchange rate and inflation expectations remain high enough.",
        "Moving forward, should inflation risks fall as much as to ensure with greater certainty that the Bank of Russia achieves its inflation target, the Bank of Russia will resume a gradual lowering of its key rate at one of its forthcoming Board meetings.",
        "On 18 March 2016, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep its key rate at 11.00% p.a.",
        "Despite certain stabilisation in financial and commodity markets and a slowdown in inflation, inflation risks remain high.",
        "These stem from the current developments in the oil market, persistently high inflation expectations and some uncertainties surrounding budget configuration.",
        "To enable the accomplishment of inflation targets, the Bank of Russia may conduct its moderately tight monetary policy for a more prolonged time than previously planned.",
        "The Bank of Russia predicts that, consistent with this decision, annual inflation will total less than 6% in March 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors took as a premise the expectations for oil prices which are lower than its December forecast.",
        "The current oil market still features a continued oversupply, on the backdrop of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, more supplies originating from Iran and tighter competition for market share.",
        "This is why the certain recovery in crude prices seen in the recent weeks may prove to be unsustainable.",
        "In recognition of this, the Bank of Russia assumed in its baseline scenario the average forecast oil price of $30 per barrel in 2016, with its gradual rise to $40 per barrel to 2018.",
        "Despite growing oil prices and ruble strengthening in the latest period, the accumulated weakening of the ruble, impacted by the drop in oil prices, between late 2015 and early 2016, is still putting pro-inflationary pressure on the economy, contributing to continued high inflation expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation slowdown is continuing.",
        "Under the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual consumer price growth rate is down from 9.8% in January 2016 to 7.9 % as of 14 March 2016.",
        "This is lower than the forecast for inflation for the year ahead, which, the Bank of Russia released in its March 2015 press release (circa 9%).",
        "Alongside with monetary policy, instrumental in the slowdown of consumer prices are the Government decisions as regards indexation of wages and pensions, as well as declining global food prices.",
        "In 2Q 2016, as the Bank of Russia forecast suggests, quarterly inflation will continue to decline.",
        "However, annual inflation may accelerate temporarily in the middle of the year as a result of the low base effect.",
        "Provided there are no new shocks emerging, subsequently annual inflation is set to resume its decline.",
        "Slower consumer price growth will be triggered by weak demand and gradually descending inflation expectations, driven by, inter alia, the moderately tight monetary policy.",
        "The Bank of Russia forcasts that, consistent with the decision, annual inflation will total less than 6% in March 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia took into account the macroeconomic fundamentals which suggest a less severe downturn than previously estimated considering this level of oil prices.",
        "The floating exchange rate serves to partially set off the negative impact of the external shocks on the economy.",
        "The weakening of the ruble has resulted in Russian products gaining competitiveness, while it also helped economic growth in individual industries.",
        "These include agriculture, the food industry, chemicals and mining.",
        "Employment data and production capacity utilisation have recently been steady.",
        "The economic adjustment to the low level of commodity prices is expected to continue.",
        "The Bank of Russia forecasts assume the economic downturn to slow down to 1.3%-1.5% in 2016.",
        "Also, it is expected that quarterly GDP growth rates will enter positive territory between late 2016 and early 2017.",
        "Going forward, the advancing processes of import substitution and non-energy export expansion will help a gradual economic recovery.",
        "The Bank of Russia Board of Directors has recognised that, as a result of the Reserve Fund spending to cover budget deficit, banks show decreased demand for the Bank of Russia’s refinancing.",
        "Hence, we see softening of monetary conditions, impacted by reduced structural deficit of liquidity even if the key rate is unchanged.",
        "The risks remain that inflation may exceed the target in late 2017.",
        "These relate to a further worsening in the oil market developments; persistent elevated inflation expectations; the global food price performance; changed rates of indexation of regulated prices, wages and pensions, as well as the uncertainty around a balanced federal budget over the medium term.",
        "To enable the accomplishment of inflation targets, the Bank of Russia may conduct its moderately tight monetary policy for a more prolonged time than previously planned.",
        "On 16 December 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.00% per annum.",
        "The Board of Directors notes that the dynamics of inflation and economic activity are overall in line with the forecast and inflation risks have subsided somewhat.",
        "Consumer price growth is slowing down in part under the influence of temporary factors, while reduction in inflation expectations remains unstable.",
        "Given this decision and considering that the moderately tight monetary policy is maintained, inflation will slow to the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "As the trend towards a sustainable decline in consumer price growth takes root, the Bank of Russia will consider an opportunity of cutting the key rate in the first half of 2017.",
        "When making its key rate decisions in the months ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside with the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with the baseline forecast.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors proceeded from the following: Annual inflation continues to decline in line with the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast.",
        "However, this is partly due to temporary factors.",
        "According to estimates, as of 12 December 2016 annual price growth fell to 5.6% from 6.1% in October.",
        "Price growth has slowed down noticeably in all key groups of goods and services and monthly seasonally adjusted inflation indicators have declined as well.",
        "The ruble exchange rate dynamics continues to be conducive to inflation deceleration as oil prices have been higher than expected and Russian financial assets remain attractive to external investors.",
        "A good harvest still facilitates a reduction in food inflation.",
        "At the same time, a more confident drop in non-food price growth is necessary for sustainable inflation decline.",
        "Households prefer to stick to a savings behaviour model, however, the disinflationary impact of domestic demand is subsiding gradually.",
        "Annual growth in real wages may facilitate a gradual recovery of demand for goods and services.",
        "Consumer lending dynamics do not entail material inflation risks so far.",
        "Moderately tight monetary conditions need to be maintained in order to encourage households to save and set the trend towards sustainable inflation reduction under the impact of the demand-side constraints.",
        "This will enable a further decline in inflation expectations of both households and businesses.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given the decision made annual inflation will slow to the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "The economy is progressing towards recovery in line with the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast.",
        "The estimates show that quarter-on-quarter GDP was no longer in decline in Q3 and industrial production expanded in October—November.",
        "However, the rebound in economic activity is still heterogeneous among industries and regions.",
        "Import substitution is advancing together with certain non-commodity exports and new lines of industrial growth, including the high-tech development.",
        "Business activity in services is also on the rise.",
        "Positive trends will take time to evolve and take hold.",
        "By the end of 2016, the output of goods and services will decrease by 0.5-0.7% with a slight growth in quarterly GDP to be seen in Q4.",
        "We expect moderate economic growth of less than 1% in 2017 and an increase to 1.5-2% in 2018-2019.",
        "The labour market is adapting to the new economic conditions and unemployment remains persistently low.",
        "The forecast is based on conservative assumptions about sluggish global growth, year-average oil prices of $40 per barrel for the entire forecast horizon, moderate capital outflow and structural constraints in the Russian economy.",
        "Risks that inflation fails to achieve the 4% target in 2017 have subsided somewhat.",
        "These risks stem largely from the inertia of inflation expectations and a decrease in household propensity to save.",
        "Price volatility in global commodity and financial markets may also have an adverse impact on exchange rate and inflation expectations.",
        "Approving of conservative budget consolidation strategy, including moderate indexation of wages and pensions in the medium-term horizon, makes an uncertainty and inflation risks from fiscal policy subside.",
        "At the same time, these risks might increase if government spending rise in higher oil price scenario.",
        "As the trend towards a sustainable decline in consumer price growth takes root, the Bank of Russia will consider an opportunity of cutting the key rate in the first half of 2017.",
        "When making its key rate decisions in the months ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside with the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with the baseline forecast.",
        "On 10 June 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 11.00 to 10.50 The Board of Directors notes the positive trends of more stable inflation, decreased inflation expectations and inflation risks against the backdrop of imminent growth recovery in the economy.",
        "Slowing inflation allows more certain reliance on sustainable inflation reduction to less than 5% in May 2017 and the 4% target in late 2017, taking into account the decision just made and the retention moderately tight monetary policy.",
        "The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory.",
        "In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors.",
        "There is more confidence in steadily positive trends in the inflation dynamics.",
        "Consumer prices grew less than predicted.",
        "The annual inflation has stabilised at 7.3% and the annualised monthly inflation, seasonally adjusted, is about 5%.",
        "Economic activity indicators improve along with ongoing low consumer demand and a high rate of savings without creating upward pressure on consumer prices.",
        "Inflation expectations of households and businesses continue to decrease.",
        "The situation in the global commodity markets was more favourable than expected and contributed to the inflation slowdown through the ruble exchange rate and food price movements (these factors’ influence is temporary and is subject to decrease, which is considered in the inflation forecast).",
        "The administered prices and tariffs will be adjusted in July in compliance with the stated plans, but to a lesser extent than a year ago.",
        "Consumer price growth rates will keep on going down further, primarily influenced by the demand-side restraints.",
        "The Bank of Russia marked down its inflation forecast for the end of 2016, to 5-6%.",
        "Considering the decision just made and retaining the current monetary policy stance, the annual inflation will be less than 5% in May 2017 to reach the 4% target in late 2017.",
        "Positive trends in the economy are not accompanied by a higher inflationary pressure.",
        "The figures of the GDP dynamics in 2016 Q1 and macroeconomic indicators for April confirm greater sustainability of the Russian economy to oil price fluctuations.",
        "Import substitution and non-commodity exports continue to expand and additional growth areas in manufacturing are taking shape.",
        "However, the changes in economic dynamics vary across the industries and regions.",
        "Investments continue to show a downward trend and a wide range of industries experience stagnation, including those that have traditionally been the sources of growth for the Russian economy.",
        "Yet positive shifts in the economy anticipate the beginning of its growth recovery.",
        "Quarterly GDP growth is expected no later than 2016 H2.",
        "The forecast predicts a GDP increase of 1.3% in 2017 and annual growth rate for output of goods and services remaining low in the following years.",
        "The forecast is based on a fairly conservative estimate of the annual average oil price, which is approximately $40 per barrel over the three-year horizon.",
        "Monetary conditions will still be moderately tight, despite a slight easing due to the lowering banking sector liquidity deficit.",
        "Real interest rates in the economy (adjusted for inflation expectations) will remain at the level that encourages savings and allows for demand for loans that does not cause an increase in inflationary pressure.",
        "In order to ensure operational control over the level and structure of market interest rates in the context of the emerging transition to the banking sector liquidity surplus, the Bank of Russia is ready to take a set of measures designed to mop up liquidity.",
        "The risks that inflation will not reach the target of 4% in 2017 declined, but still remain at a heightened level.",
        "This primarily stems from inflation expectation inertness, the lack of budget consolidation strategy and the uncertainty in the parameters of future indexation of wages and pensions.",
        "Volatility in the global commodity and financial markets also might have a negative impact on the exchange rate and inflation expectations.",
        "The materialisation of these risks might cause a slowdown in the inflation reduction.",
        "The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory.",
        "On 29 July 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.50 percent per annum.",
        "The Board notes that inflation dynamics and the nascent rebound in economic activity are overall aligned to the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast.",
        "However, the decline in inflation expectations has stalled.",
        "This decision, along with the maintenance of moderately tight monetary policy, will help deliver on the inflation target.",
        "The Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual growth rate of consumer prices will be less than 5% in July 2017, to reach the target of 4% in late 2017.",
        "The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and the alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory.",
        "In making the key rate decision, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia was guided by the following considerations: First.",
        "Inflation is currently slowing down in line with the Bank of Russia’s baseline forecast.",
        "This is helped by the economic environment including steady Russian financial market, persistently weak consumer demand and the indexation of administered prices and rates as previously planned.",
        "The Bank of Russia estimates the annual growth rate of consumer prices to decline, as of 25 July 2016, to 7.2%.",
        "At the same time, there has been a stop in the decline of core inflation, seasonally adjusted monthly growth rates of consumer prices and inflation expectations.",
        "The slowdown of inflation is set to continue, primarily triggered by demand-side constraints.",
        "The lower — compared to last year’s — indexation of administered prices and rates in July, as well as the expectations for good crops, will contribute to the slowdown of inflation, helping recede inflation expectations.",
        "According to the Bank of Russia forecast, as the moderately tight monetary conditions remain in place, annual inflation will dip below 5% in July 2017 to reach the target level of 4% by late 2017.",
        "The tight monetary conditions will be maintained, although somewhat eased following the contraction of the banking sector’s liquidity deficit and the June 2016 reduction in the Bank of Russia key rate.",
        "The real interest rates in the economy (adjusted for inflation expectations) will stay at a mark where demand for credit will be met without heightened inflationary pressure, retaining the incentives to save.",
        "To enable operating control over the level and structure of market interest rates, in the context of the switchover to a nascent liquidity surplus in the banking sector, the Bank of Russia will use the appropriate toolset to absorb liquidity.",
        "Production recovery fails to cause consumer price growth amid slack demand.",
        "Import substitution steps up and non-commodity exports expand.",
        "Economic dynamics are patchy across sectors and regions.",
        "Industry, including manufacturing, discovers new opportunities for growth.",
        "At the same time, certain industries stagnate or show lower output growth, while investment continues to contract.",
        "Nevertheless, the trend for economic recovery prevails.",
        "Positive quarterly growth of GDP is possible in the second half of the year.",
        "Annual GDP growth is predicted to enter positive territory in 2017.",
        "The risks of failure to deliver on the 4% inflation target in 2017 persist following primarily, along with the external risks, the inertia of inflation expectations and the uncertainty over specific fiscal consolidation measures, including wage and pension indexation.",
        "The emerging trend towards wage increase and deposit rate cut may undermine households’ propensity to save.",
        "To alleviate these risks, the Bank of Russia has to keep rates at a level that encourages saving, brings down inflation expectations and promotes sustainable inflation reduction to the target level.",
        "The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and the alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory."
