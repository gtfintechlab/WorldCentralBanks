The MonetaryPolicy Committee of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) held its second quarterlymeeting of 2007 in Beijing days ago. It was noted thatthe Chinese economy has continued to display a steady and fast growth momentum.Following the guidance of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee andthe State Council, the PBC closely monitored economic and financialdevelopments while at the same time applying various monetary instruments tostrengthen liquidity management, steadily push forward interest rate reform andincrease flexibility of the RMB exchange rate. Generally speaking, thefinancial industry has been operating soundly. The Committeeconducted in-depth analysis of the current economic and financial developmentsboth at home and abroad, noting that while the economy broadly remained sound,problems of structural imbalances, heavy reliance on resources input and imbalancesof payments still existed. The Committee called for full implementation of thescientific development approach by stabilizing, improving and carrying out eachmacroeconomic policy, continuously strengthening macroeconomic management toprevent a shift from a relatively fast growth to an economic overheating andensure a sound and rapid development of the Chinese economy. Appropriatemeasures should be taken to improve coordination of the monetary policy with fiscalpolicy, industrial policy, trade policy and financial regulatory policy,actively expand domestic consumption demand, manage the growth of fixed assetinvestment at appropriate level and optimize the investment structure.Meanwhile, efforts should be made to accelerate economic restructuring as wellas the transformation of economic growth pattern, improve growth quality andefficiency, and promote a basic equilibrium of the balance of payments. Weighing monetarypolicy stance and measures for the coming periods, the Committee holds the viewthat the sound monetary policy featuring a steady and moderate tighteningshould be continued while efforts need to be made to improve theforward-looking, scientific and effective approach in the making of monetarypolicy. While providing guidance to ensure a rational growth of money andcredit on the aggregate level, measures should be applied to strengthen policycoordination between the local and foreign currencies, enhance liquiditymanagement of the banking system and apply a mix of monetary policy instrumentsto maintain basic stability of the price level. Besides, forceful actionsshould be taken to push ahead financial reform and innovation, promote developmentof a multi-layer financial market, and improve competitiveness of financialinstitutions and efficiency of the financial market in resource allocation.Development of the money market benchmark interest rate system should beaccelerated to further increase the role of price in macro financialmanagement. Improvement of the managed floating exchange rate regime should be effected,continuously following the principles of “self-initiated, controllable andgradualistic”. Market supply and demand of foreign exchange should be allowedto play its fundamental role in the formation of RMB exchange rate, with a viewto keeping the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive andequilibrium level.
