        "The provisional foreign trade data for September and the high frequency data for October suggest that the deceleration in exports continues.",
        "Having posted a limited deceleration excluding energy and gold, imports, on the other hand, have maintained their strength due to the high level of energy and gold imports.",
        "Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continue to support the current account balance.",
        "While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, thanks to the increase in per capita tourist spending, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues.",

        "Although inflation expectations have declined across all horizons, the current levels remain above our inflation forecasts in the May Inflation Report and continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook.",

        "Moreover, the rise in red meat prices in the unprocessed food subgroup has decelerated significantly in May on the back of the fall in carcass meat prices.",
        "As for processed food inflation that is projected to remain high on a monthly basis, the leading drivers are bread and cereals as well as meat and dairy products reflecting the price hikes in the related unprocessed food items.",
        "The energy group will have a marked impact on consumer inflation in May.",
        "In the energy group, despite the fall in fuel prices in tandem with dropping international crude oil prices, a high monthly increase will be seen in May due to the expiry of the free use of 25 m3 natural gas.",
        "In fact, the mechanical effect of the expiry of this offer is estimated to push monthly consumer inflation up by 0.7 points in May.",
        "Adjusted for this natural gas-driven effect, seasonally adjusted consumer inflation is expected to decline compared to April.",
        "Despite the mild course of monthly inflation, annual consumer inflation will rise notably in May, which will be led by the base effect stemming from energy prices as mentioned in previous policy documents.",
        "In fact, energy prices fell quite sharply in May 2023 on the back of the free use of natural gas.",

        "Monetary policy stance will be tightened in case a significant and persistent deterioration in inflation is foreseen.",
        "The decisiveness regarding tight monetary stance will bring down the underlying trend of monthly inflation through moderation in domestic demand, real appreciation in Turkish lira, and improvement in inflation expectations.",
        "Consequently, disinflation will be established in the second half of 2024.",
        "Considering the recent developments in credit growth and deposits, additional steps were taken to preserve the macro financial stability and to support the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "The excess liquidity stemming from the surging domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira financial assets was decided to be sterilized through additional measures.",
        "Accordingly, reserve requirement ratios for Turkish lira deposits and FX-protected deposits (KKM accounts) were raised, withdrawing approximately 550 billion TL of liquidity from the system.",
        "Moreover, in order to ensure a faster decline in KKM accounts, changes were made regarding the remuneration and commission practices for reserve requirements.",
        "Lastly, taking into account the acceleration in foreign currency loan growth, a monthly growth limit of 2% has been introduced for foreign currency loans, and it was decided to block Turkish lira required reserves amounting to loans exceeding the limit for one year.",

        "The first quarter growth data for advanced economies is supportive of the moderate recovery in economic activity, while leading indicators suggest that this recovery is mostly driven by the services sector.",
        "The US economic growth trend continued to diverge positively from other advanced economies.",
        "The cautious pace of interest rate cuts to ensure a permanent decline in inflation and geopolitical risks are seen as prominent risk factors for the course of global economic activity in 2024.",

        "While emerging economies (EMEs) continue to cut interest rates in a way to maintain monetary tightness, the central banks of some advanced economies also began to cut rates.",
        "Even though the ongoing improvement in the inflation outlook and the recent developments regarding services inflation strengthen expectations for rate cuts, central banks of advanced economies are expected to adopt a cautious approach in rate-cuts.",
        "Meanwhile, risk appetite and portfolio flows towards EMEs display a volatile course due to global uncertainties.",
        "Excess liquidity in the market due to residents' and non-residents' preference for Turkish lira assets was sterilized in May through notable increases in the reserve requirement ratios for FX-protected deposit accounts, and deposit and participation fund accounts, thus restraining the decline in interest rates on deposits.",

        "The regulation for Turkish lira loans was kept constant.",
        "Accordingly, the monthly growth limit for FX loans was lowered from 2% to 1.5%, while the monthly growth limit for Turkish lira loans was kept unchanged at 2%.",
        "Moreover, the scope of the exemption for investment loans was expanded, and it was decided to exempt investment loans extended in the scope of the funding provided by international development finance institutions from the growth limits for Turkish lira and foreign currency loans.",

        "Mainly, the fall in the corresponding growth rate of personal credit card balances contributed to this decline.",
        "In the same period, Turkish lira-denominated commercial loans remained on a mild growth path, at an average four-week growth rate of 1.46%.",
        "In this period, the average four-week growth rate of FX commercial loans adjusted for exchange rates declined from 4.13% to 1.61% due to the restrictions introduced.",
        "To support the monetary transmission mechanism, the CBRT has taken policy measures to accelerate the unwinding process of FX-Protected Deposit Accounts.",

        "Information on consumption expenditures from interviews with firms also pointed to a slowdown in domestic demand.",
        "On the other hand, two religious holidays and the associated bridge days due to administrative leaves in the second quarter obscured a clear picture regarding the extent of the slowdown in demand.",
        "In the second quarter, card spending continued to increase on a quarterly basis, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Despite posting a limited monthly decline, card spending in the first week of July implies an almost flat course in quarterly terms.",
        "Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted imports of consumption goods fell in June, but still hovered above the average of the previous year.",

        "During this period, the annualized services balance surplus recorded a month-on-month increase.",
        "In June, provisional foreign trade data pointed to a decrease in exports and an increase in imports, in seasonally adjusted terms.",

        "Having decreased both in May and June, the consumption goods imports remain elevated in seasonally adjusted terms.",

        "In this group, price increases weakened in rents and restaurants-hotels, yet strengthened in transport and communication services.",
        "In seasonally adjusted terms, the price increase in core goods remained limited, which was driven by the durable goods subgroup (excluding gold), whose prices fell for the first time since August 2021 due to the mild course of the exchange rate and domestic demand developments.",
        "Automobile prices dropped in this period, due also to destocking campaigns in advance of the general safety regulation (GSR 2) for vehicles that was put into effect on 7 July.",
        "Meanwhile, the monthly price increase in the food group stood close that in the previous month.",
        "In the unprocessed food subgroup, fresh fruits and vegetables recorded surging prices, while the ongoing price hikes in red meat were replaced by a decline, and similarly, prices of chicken meat decreased in this period.",

        "In this period, the deceleration spread across the groups making up the B index, and became more apparent in the core goods group.",
        "Similarly, the Median, SATRIM, the diffusion index and other underlying trend indicators also posted a month-on-month slowdown.",
        "In addition to the high level of and the stickiness in services inflation, inflation expectations, geopolitical risks, and food prices keep inflationary pressures alive.",

        "In June, prices were noticeable in communication services as well as the transport services driven by the Eid al-Adha.",
        "In this period, although having slowed down compared to previous months, increase in rents remained high.",
        "Leading indicators tracked through micro data from the Retail Payment System (RPS) imply that monthly rent inflation will rise due also to the higher rate of renewed contracts in July.",
        "On the other hand, both the rate of rent increases in new and renewed contracts and rental rates monitored through residential property valuation reports are below the current annual level in the rent item in the consumer price index (CPI).",
        "This implies that annual rent inflation in the CPI will lose pace in the period ahead.",
        "However, the high inertia in this item is considered to cause rent inflation to remain high and continue to shape the course of consumer inflation in the disinflation period, though at a declining rate.",
        "Transport services recorded a high monthly price increase in June also due to the Eid al-Adha.",
        "Communication services posted a stronger month-on-month price hike due to mobile phone and internet fees as well as postal services.",
        "Moreover, education was another services item that stood out due to revisions in private school fees.",
        "Having a high tendency for backward indexation and being affected by wage developments, the effect of private school fees on consumer inflation may lose strength gradually in the summer depending on the announcement dates.",
        "On the other hand, it should be noted that education services inflation will be affected by price adjustments stemming from private university tuitions in September.",
        "Domestic producer prices rose by 1.38% in June, and annual inflation dropped by 7.59 percentage points to 50.09% also due to the low base effect.",

        "The Committee closely monitors the alignment of inflation expectations and pricing behavior with projections.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that monthly inflation will rise temporarily in July due to adjustments in administered prices and taxes as well as supply-side factors in unprocessed food prices, which are relatively beyond the control of monetary policy.",
        "However, the rise in the underlying inflation is expected to be relatively limited.",
        "Energy prices are envisaged to rise significantly in July due to the increase in residential electricity tariffs, the special consumption tax (SCT) revision in fuel and bottled gas prices, and the rise in municipal water prices.",
        "Increased electricity prices for businesses are expected to have a negative impact on services prices through the cost channel in July and the upcoming months.",
        "The prices of transport services are on an upward track due to rising fuel prices.",

        "The course of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage prices also adversely affects the restaurants-hotels group through the beverage services channel.",
        "Moreover, the partial reflection of the tax-induced effect in the final prices of tobacco products is expected to carry some of the need for an increase over the following month.",
        "In the food group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables increased significantly in July due to temperatures above seasonal norms, while prices of food excluding fresh fruits and vegetables followed a milder course.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that the recent mild course of exchange rates and domestic demand developments have resulted in moderate price increases in core goods when compared to other groups.",
        "In sum, leading indicators suggest that energy, unprocessed food, alcohol-tobacco groups were the main drivers of monthly consumer inflation in July, while core indicators excluding these groups saw a relatively limited rise.",

        "Nevertheless, in their communications, central banks of advanced economies, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), highlighted the decline in core inflation and lowered their medium-term inflation forecasts.",
        "As a result, expectations that rate cuts may start earlier in 2024 have strengthened, while projections for the likely course of policy rates have been revised downwards.",
        "However, with centrals banks drawing attention to overpricing and higher-than-expected inflation readings in January, policy rate expectations priced by markets have gone up again in the recent period, and the probability of a more cautious rate-cut path has increased.",

        "As a result of the monetary policies implemented, global financial conditions have become significantly tighter, the frequency of policy rate-hike decisions has decreased, and central banks of many advanced and emerging economies have reached the end of monetary tightening process.",
        "The Bank of Japan signaled an end to the negative rate policy it has pursued since 2016 while the Bank of Canada, which has kept its policy rate unchanged for the last four meetings, clearly indicated in its meeting statement that the rate-hike cycle was coming to an end.",
        "Meanwhile, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru continued with policy rate cuts on the back of declining consumer inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the central banks of South Africa, Indonesia, and Poland kept their policy rates constant at their January meetings.",
        "Given the levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that policy rates in these economies will continue to be adjusted in line with decreasing inflation; however, the tightness of monetary policy is expected to be maintained so as to ensure the disinflationary trend.",
        "Despite the flat global growth outlook, labor markets continue to be tight.",
        "The global growth index, which is weighted with the export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, remained flat compared to the previous MPC meeting period.",

        "On the other hand, despite the recent downward trend in global headline and core inflation rates, the continuation of tight monetary policies implemented to ensure a permanent decline in these rates and geopolitical risks are prominent risk factors for the course of global economic activity in 2024.",
        "The fall in global inflation rates in the previous MPC meeting period and the Fed’s communication at its December meeting led to a significant recovery in the global risk appetite.",

        "In addition to its direct effects, the food group continued to have a negative impact on headline inflation indirectly through catering services.",
        "Monthly inflation in the energy group was mainly driven by the fuel item, due to the course of the Turkish lira as well as rising oil prices due to geopolitical developments, and the decisions regarding the oil production, and diminishing stock levels, while the mechanical impact of the free use of natural gas on monthly consumer inflation was quite limited at 0.01 percentage points.",

        "The Committee closely monitors the alignment of inflation expectations and pricing behavior with projections, and the impact of wage increases on inflation.",

        "In education services, high rates of increases are observed due to private school fees.",
        "Considering that private school fees, which are highly prone to the backward-indexation tendency and are also affected by wage developments, will be reflected to the Consumer Price Index gradually until July depending on price announcement dates, there is a risk that services inflation will be unfavorably affected by this channel in the near future.",

        "On the other hand, leading indicators point to a month-on-month increase in prices of durable goods that have high and fast exchange rate pass-through.",
        "Thus, the March inflation outlook is affected by developments in exchange rates and commodity prices, resilient course of domestic demand, and the effects of Ramadan-specific factors (especially on red meat) carried over from the previous month, while the backward-indexation tendency continues to have repercussions and price increases continue particularly in education services.",

        "The favorable course in food prices is driven by the unprocessed food group, which registers a decline led by fresh fruit and vegetable prices.",
        "In this period, as the three-month average increases in core indicators B and C remain flat, the underlying trend of inflation is not expected to display a significant change.",
        "Despite the fall in fuel prices, monthly energy inflation will remain high due to the adjustment in natural gas tariffs for households.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that thanks to the recent mild course of exchange rates and domestic demand developments, price increases in core goods remain below those of other groups.",
        "The favorable outlook in durable goods continues.",
        "Nevertheless, price increases in the services group remain strong.",
        "In addition to rents, administered transport services and education stand out.",
        "University tuition fees, particularly private universities, have increased significantly, and this year, university tuition fees have been reflected on the index earlier because of the admission period.",
        "Accordingly, it should be noted that the impact of price adjustments linked to university tuition fees will be observed on monthly services inflation and thus on core indicators in the next two months.",
        "Considering the lagged effects of the monetary tightening, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, but reiterated that it remains highly attentive to inflation risks.",
        "The decisiveness regarding tight monetary stance will bring down the underlying trend of monthly inflation through moderation in domestic demand, real appreciation in Turkish lira, and improvement in inflation expectations.",
        "Consequently, the disinflation process will gain strength.",
        "The tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed, and inflation expectations converge to the projected forecast range.",
        "Monetary policy stance will be tightened in case a significant and persistent deterioration in inflation is foreseen.",
        "In case of unanticipated developments in credit and deposit markets, monetary transmission mechanism will be supported via additional macroprudential measures.",
        "Liquidity conditions are assessed with respect to prospective developments and closely monitored.",
        "Sterilization tools will continue to be implemented effectively.",
        "Taking into account the lagged effects of monetary tightening, the Committee will make its policy decisions so as to create the monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored, and the Committee will decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.",
        "The Committee will make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven, and transparent framework."

        "In addition to international developments, energy consumption supports, natural gas in particular, have been affecting the disinflation process favorably.",
        "The decision to provide household natural gas free of charge for full use in May and for use of 25 cubic meters for the following 11 months is likely to have a stronger-than-expected downward effect on prices in the coming months, due to the significant weight of natural gas in the consumption basket and the country-wide coverage of this support.",
        "In the absence of additional supports, this downward effect will gradually become neutralized within the index in the last quarter of the year, as cold weather and consumption of energy for heating purposes come into effect.",
        "While level and underlying trend of inflation continue to improve with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored.",

        "Thus, in the first quarter, the index recorded an increase of 6.5% quarter-on-quarter, thereby confirming the strong course of domestic demand.",
        "Other indicators of consumption demand and the survey data suggest that production and consumption, which dropped due to the disaster-related effects in February, have posted a strong recovery trend since March, and that domestic demand has been stronger than foreign demand.",

        "Credit card expenditures continued to recover towards pre-disaster levels as of mid-May in the most severely affected provinces, while they are above the pre-disaster levels in other provinces in the disaster zone.",

        "While the share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing increase in domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive.",
        "Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.",
        "The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.",
        "In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability.",

        "Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.",
        "The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability.",
        "The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 are closely monitored.",
        "The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability.",
        "As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets.",
        "The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of Open Market Operations funding, to reduce the weight of swaps in the composition of funding, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.",
        "The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored.",
        "Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.",
        "Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.",
        "Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs.",
        "This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.",
        "The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.",
        "The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.",
        "Global inflation has been decreasing recently, but it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets.",
        "Compared to the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting period, consumer inflation decreased from 3.36% to 2.67% in advanced economies, while it increased from 6.08% to 6.16% in emerging economies due to the rise in Russia (1).",
        "Accordingly, inflation continues to hover above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies.",
        "Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.2% and 6.4%, respectively.",

        "Brent crude oil prices per barrel have fluctuated in the USD 73-83 range since the previous MPC meeting while the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price, which serves as a benchmark for European natural gas prices, has decreased.",
        "The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 25.6% above the average of the previous ten years.",
        "The index fell 29.0% from its peak level last year.",
        "Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which has declined 15.9% from its peak level last year, is 10.1% above the average of the previous ten years.",
        "Its level continues to have an impact on inflation due to the high share of food items in consumer basket.",
        "High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for some time.",
        "Nevertheless, in their communications, central banks of advanced economies, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), highlighted the decline in core inflation and lowered their medium-term inflation forecasts.",
        "As a result, expectations that rate cuts may start earlier in 2024 have strengthened, while projections for the likely course of policy rates have been revised downwards.",
        "The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 172 meetings in the last 22 months, and policy rates were increased in 107 of these meetings (2).",
        "During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 254 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 107 of these meetings.",
        "As a result of the monetary policies implemented, global financial conditions have become significantly tighter, the frequency of policy rate decisions has decreased and central banks of many advanced and emerging economies have reached the end of monetary tightening process.",
        "The Bank of Russia continued to increase policy rates as the uptrend in inflation continued.",
        "Meanwhile, central banks of Brazil, Peru, Chile and Hungary continued with policy rate cuts on the back of the decline in consumer inflation, while the Central Bank of Colombia cut its policy rate for the first time in a long time.",
        "Given the levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that policy rates in these economies will continue to be adjusted in line with decreasing inflation, however, the tightness of monetary policy is expected to maintained so as to ensure the disinflationary trend.",
        "Despite the flat global growth outlook, labor markets continue to be tight.",
        "The global growth index, which is weighted with the export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, declined slightly compared to the previous MPC meeting.",
        "The index projects a growth level of 1.6% in 2023, which is approximately 0.3 percentage points higher than its lowest level in January.",
        "However, considering the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022, a notable slowdown in the global growth outlook, which affects Türkiye’s foreign demand, is observed on an annual basis.",
        "On the other hand, the Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data posted a limited rise in November.",
        "In November, the global manufacturing industry PMI increased 0.5 points month-on-month to 49.3, while the global services PMI increased 0.2 points to 50.6.",
        "Thus, in November, the global composite PMI index increased 0.4 points over the previous month and reached 50.4.",
        "The rise in the global PMI data was driven by both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Nevertheless, a comparison between the average values of global PMI data for the October-November period and averages of previous quarters reveals that PMI indices have declined compared to the first half of the year.",
        "The PMI data for the services sector, which was the major driving force of global economic activity particularly in the first half of the year, significantly declined in the October-November period both in the advanced economies group and the emerging economies group.",
        "The composite PMI indicator for the Euoro Area, one of the Türkiye’s major trading partner, decreased 0.6 points month-on-month to 47 in December and continued to hover below the threshold value.",
        "In the Euro Area, compared to the previous month, the manufacturing PMI remained unchanged in December, while services PMI decreased 0.7 points and these indicators were recorded at 44.2 and 48.1, respectively.",
        "On a quarterly basis, the Euro Area composite PMI declined 0.5 points quarter-on-quarter to 47 in the final quarter of the year.",
        "This indicates that the slowdown in economic activity in the Euro Area in the third quarter continues in the last quarter of the year.",
        "In China, the composite PMI rose 1.6 points to 51.6 in November, driven by both manufacturing and services sectors.",
        "Meanwhile, the October-November average of the Chinese composite PMI declined 0.7 points quarter-on-quarter to 50.8.",
        "Against this background, the slowdown in global economic activity in the third quarter is expected to continue in the last quarter and the global economy is projected to display a growth outlook similar to the third quarter.",
        "In the August-October period (31 July-), due to the expectation that central banks of advanced economies will maintain their tight monetary policy stance for a longer period, the fluctuations in the global risk appetite, and the uncertainty regarding the Chinese economy, there was a total outflow of USD 54.6 billion from equity markets and USD 5.4 billion from bond markets of emerging economies.",
        "In the following period, the US inflation decreased in two consecutive months in October and November to 3.1%, and the Fed’s communication at its December meeting led to a significant recovery in the global risk appetite.",
        "As a result, in the five weeks between the 6th of November and the 8th of December, USD 15.9 billion flowed into equity markets and USD 3.6 billion into bond markets.",
        "The recent stabilization of the decline in the core inflation trend in advanced economies and the ongoing easing of supply-side factors, combined with the weak course of commodity prices, have led to an improvement in the global inflation outlook.",
        "Geopolitical risks, the level of monetary tightness and the timing of interest rate cuts by central banks of advanced economies will determine the course of the global economy in the upcoming period.",
        "Consumer prices rose 3.28% in November, and annual inflation increased 0.62 percentage points to 62.0%.",
        "Headline inflation edged up in November and remains in line with the outlook presented in the most recent Inflation Report.",
        "As the limit for the free use of natural gas was exceeded (first 25 cubic metres), the impact of the natural gas item on the monthly consumer inflation rose to 1.01 percentage points, which is consistent with projections.",
        "When the effect of natural gas is excluded, the rate of increase in consumer prices declined further.",
        "While exchange rates follow a steady course, global energy prices continue to recede from the readings at the end of September.",
        "However, the existing level of domestic demand, stickiness in services inflation, and geopolitical risks keep inflation pressures alive.",
        "Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 1.74 percentage points to 3.13 percentage points in the energy group (up by 1.39 percentage points); from 2.59 percentage points to 2.90 percentage points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (up by 0.31 percentage points); from 23.4 percentage points to 23.5 percentage points in the services group (up by 0.16 percentage points); but decreased from 17.8 percentage points to 17.0 percentage points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (down by 0.84 percentage points) and from 15.8 percentage points to 15.4 percentage points in the core goods group (down by 0.40 percentage points).",

        "In November, price hikes were noteworthy in pulses, rice and white meat within the other unprocessed food group.",
        "In this period, monthly price increases grew larger in the processed food group, with prices of milk and dairy products, processed meat products, fats and oils and canned vegetables coming to the fore.",
        "Energy prices increased 9.98% in November, and annual energy inflation increased 9.58 percentage points to 21.2%.",
        "In line with the higher consumption of natural gas, 25 cubic meters of which is offered free of charge, prices included in the basket rose further, raising energy prices.",
        "Accordingly, the natural gas item pushed monthly headline inflation up 1.01 percentage points in November.",
        "The contribution of natural gas to monthly inflation is projected to weaken in December.",
        "Following the developments in crude oil prices, fuel prices fell 1.06%.",

        "The lump-sum SCT increase has a negative impact on consumer inflation both directly and indirectly.",

        "Recently, while price hikes in administered transportation services have become more frequent, it is assessed that the rise in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables contrary to the seasonal averages was also induced by fuel-driven developments.",
        "Shocks such as tax and administered price increases, minimum wage regulation and exchange rate developments, which are considered temporary during normal inflation periods, may have longer-lasting negative effects on expectations and inflation inertia than expected in a high inflation environment.",
        "In addition to these factors, higher-than-anticipated deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior due to the factors affecting inflation as well as the rise in oil prices in July and beyond keep upside risks to the inflation outlook alive.",

        "Meanwhile, since the last MPC meeting period, personal loan growth has lost further momentum, increasing by 0.8% from 14 July.",
        "This was driven by the expansion of the scope of the loan growth-based securities maintenance practice.",
        "In the same period, although its growth slowed down to 7%, personal credit cards maintained its strong trend, and its annual growth remained flat at 184.2%.",

        "Foreign direct investments, improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, and the positive impact of tourism revenues on current account balance will contribute significantly to price stability.",

        "The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The Committee assessed that because of the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the capacity of the monetary policy framework to achieve the 5% inflation target should be enhanced.",
        "The Committee drew attention to the risks that a deterioration in price stability may pose to macroeconomic stability and especially to financial stability.",
        "Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.",
        "The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.",

        "Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.",
        "Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.",
        "Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs.",
        "This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.",
        "The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.",
        "The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

        "In October, consumer prices increased by 1.55 percent, and annual inflation edged down by 0.37 points to 7.58 percent.",
        "Annual food inflation declined on account of the unprocessed food prices, while the annual energy inflation decreased due to the base effect.",
        "Meanwhile, the depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed annual inflation in core goods upwards.",
        "Annual services inflation, on the other hand, maintained its high levels.",
        "Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators and their seasonally adjusted underlying trend registered increases.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages declined by around 2 points to 8.69 percent in October.",
        "This decline was led by annual unprocessed food inflation that receded to 9.40 percent driven particularly by the prices of vegetables.",
        "On the processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued.",
        "Leading indicators of November show that annual food inflation may increase due to the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Energy prices went up by 0.77 percent while the annual energy inflation decreased by around 1.8 points to 0.12 percent due to base effect in October.",
        "Prices of services rose by 0.71 percent in October, and annual services inflation edged up by 0.11 points to 8.65 percent.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in the restaurants-hotels group, remained flat in rent and increased in other services.",
        "Meanwhile, prices of catering services maintained the upward trend and the annual inflation in this group, with 14.87 percent, remained as the determinant of the high course of prices of services.",
        "Against this background, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibited an almost flat course in October maintaining its high level.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 1.25 points to 9.19 percent in October.",
        "The cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed the prices of core goods by 1.75 percent on a monthly basis.",
        "Witnessing the exchange rate effects with a longer lag, the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.49 percent.",
        "Moreover, the clothing group recorded the highest October price increase of the index history.",
        "Accordingly, seasonally-adjusted data showed a sustained increase in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.",
        "In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assessed that developments in energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, yet cumulative effects of the exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "After the sharp monthly increase in August, industrial production remained flat in September, thus recording a quarterly growth of 1.1 percent in the third quarter.",
        "Due to fewer working days in September, industrial production declined by a yearly 7.9 percent, yet it might pick up again year-on-year thanks to October’s increased working days.",
        "The BTS data on production over the last three months and the PMI indicators point to a moderate monthly growth for October.",
        "Industrial production has become increasingly volatile due to bridge days and the changing number of working days.",
        "Yet, seasonally and calendar adjusted three-month averages suggest that production remains on the rise.",

        "The retail sales volume index slowed quarter-on-quarter, while non-food retail sales posted a quarterly contraction in the third quarter.",
        "After a robust second-quarter, imports of investment goods were down in the third quarter on a quarterly basis.",
        "Data on construction employment and the production and imports of minerals indicate a stable pattern in construction investments.",
        "All in all, domestic demand is likely to provide a modest contribution to growth in the third quarter.",
        "The non-gold exports volume index rose in the third quarter whereas the imports index fell in line with moderate domestic demand.",
        "Therefore, the growth composition appears to be shifting in favor of net exports thanks to the rising demand from the EU countries.",
        "This composition change and the favorable developments in the terms of trade along with the moderate course of consumer loans support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Recent data indicate a marked improvement in the seasonally adjusted current account balance.",
        "Thus, the current account balance in annual terms is expected to improve further.",
        "Among BTS indicators, export orders over the last three months have seen expectations grow increasingly optimistic since early third quarter, while domestic orders have recovered recently after the weak course of the first three quarters.",
        "Moreover, the consumer confidence increased notably amid lessening domestic uncertainty.",
        "Likewise, expectations for investment and employment continued to improve.",
        "Against this background, confidence and revenue channels are expected to boost domestic demand in the upcoming period.",
        "Non-farm unemployment remained flat in August due to the falling labor force participation, while non-farm employment decreased.",
        "By sectors, employment picked up slightly in services and construction but declined in the industrial sector for the third period in a row.",
        "Thus, the average annual non-farm employment growth equaled 3 percent in the January-August period.",
        "Having trended upward for the first three quarters, industrial production is expected to remain on the rise through the rest of the year.",
        "Survey indicators for industrial employment also point to a recovery in September and October.",
        "Accordingly, the fall in industrial employment is likely to be temporary.",
        "Given the economic outlook, the modest growth in services and construction employment is expected to continue.",
        "To sum up, domestic demand appears to follow a more moderate course in the second half of the year, while external demand makes an increased contribution to growth.",
        "The recovery in European economy affects external demand positively, whereas geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk to external demand.",
        "Meanwhile, the reduced domestic uncertainty drives consumer confidence and expectations of investment and employment higher, which are expected to help to support the recovery of domestic demand over the upcoming period.",
        "Hence, aggregate demand conditions are likely to provide further support for disinflation.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "Yet, loan growth has seen some deceleration recently.",
        "Specifically, commercial loans denominated in foreign currency and consumer loans have lost significant momentum.",
        "The Committee expects loans to return to the moderate growth path amid normalized financial conditions over the upcoming period.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures, but also helps to improve the current account balance.",
        "Indicators for the second half of the year point to a moderate economic activity.",
        "Industrial production continued to grow in the third quarter as well after the first half of the year.",
        "In this period, the non-gold exports volume index increased whereas the imports index fell.",
        "The rising demand in the European economy affects Turkey’s exports positively while geopolitical developments put downward pressure on external demand.",
        "Both the recent recovery of the confidence index and the improving expectations for investment and employment are likely to bolster domestic demand.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee assesses that the growth composition has shifted in favor of net exports.",
        "In addition to this shift, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the sluggish course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Given the recent notable improvement in the seasonally-adjusted current account balance, the annual current account deficit is expected to narrow further.",
        "Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably.",
        "The negative impact of cumulative exchange rate developments since the beginning of the year on the inflation outlook is partly offset by lower oil prices.",
        "Food prices, on the other hand, remain volatile mainly due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "The cumulative Turkish lira depreciation caused the annual core goods inflation to rise and the core inflation trend to deteriorate slightly.",
        "Thus, considering the impact of the global market uncertainty on inflation expectations and the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and developments in other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause financial markets to remain volatile.",
        "Therefore, portfolio flows to emerging economies follow a volatile pattern.",
        "Despite having improved somewhat recently, risk premia and exchange rate volatilities remain high.",
        "The Committee stated that the measures announced by the CBRT within the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies” boost the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "The current monetary policy stance continues to be tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive of financial stability.",
        "In case the decline in loan growth rates becomes permanent and exchange rates continue to face upward pressure over the upcoming period, in addition to preserving the tight monetary policy stance, the Committee may take measures to support the Turkish lira and the loan growth by easing the conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels.",
        "In July, consumer prices increased by 0.09 percent while annual inflation was down 0.39 points to 6.81 percent.",

        "On the unprocessed food front, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained favorable, whereas meat prices continued to rise.",
        "Among processed food items, prices of bread and cereals continued to affect inflation favorably whereas prices of other items slightly accelerated.",
        "Annual energy inflation decreased to 1.58 percent amid falling fuel prices driven by lower oil prices.",
        "With the ongoing plunge in oil prices in July, annual energy inflation is expected to slow further in August.",
        "Prices of services were up 0.80 percent in July while annual services inflation dropped by 0.43 points to 8.42 percent.",
        "Amid higher meat prices, prices of catering services continued to soar in July.",
        "Annual inflation increased in rents and restaurants-hotels but fell in communication and transport items due to base effects.",
        "Overall, the underlying trend of services inflation posted a month-on-month improvement.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 6.05 percent in July.",
        "Annual inflation was up in durable goods, down in clothing and flat in core goods excluding clothing and durables.",
        "Prices of durable goods reflected the pass-through effect from exchange rate movements.",
        "Thanks to the favorable course in clothing prices, the underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a fall.",
        "The industrial production index increased strongly by 2.4 percent month-on-month in June.",
        "Accordingly, industrial production grew by 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and 3.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "The strong production growth in June does not signify an acceleration in economic activity and is rather a result of compensating for the output loss led by the May strikes in the auto industry and expediting production before Ramadan.",
        "In fact, leading indicators for July and August suggest that the industrial production might moderate in the second half of the year.",
        "Data on the expenditure side indicate that private consumption demand expanded further in the second quarter while investments remained weak.",
        "Production and imports of consumption goods were higher in the second quarter compared to their averages in the previous quarter.",
        "Meanwhile, production and imports of capital goods excluding vehicles fell in the second quarter.",
        "Indicators for the construction industry do not hint at a recovery for construction activity.",
        "After declining dramatically in May amid strikes, domestic sales of automobiles registered month-on-month gains in June and July.",
        "Thus, having contributed substantially to consumption lately, sales of automobiles are believed to have supported consumption further in July.",
        "On the other hand, the PMI for the July-August period and the Business Tendency Survey order indicators for July do not signal a solid domestic demand.",
        "Likewise, consumer confidence indices remained weak in July.",
        "Firms’ expectations for future investments increased slightly in July but remained sluggish.",
        "In sum, current indicators point to a moderate outlook for consumption demand yet signal no recovery for investments.",
        "After the first-quarter decline, the non-gold quantity index, an indicator for external demand, posted a quarter-on-quarter increase in the second quarter.",
        "Non-gold imports, on the other hand, grew modestly in the second quarter.",
        "As a consequence, deterioration in the real rebalancing process since mid-2014 somewhat reversed in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Amid lower energy prices, the current account balance is expected to improve further in the upcoming period.",
        "However, the relatively weak outlook of exports and the likely fall in tourism revenues may dampen this improvement.",
        "In May, seasonally adjusted total and nonfarm unemployment rates climbed by 0.2 and 0.3 points month-on-month, respectively.",
        "Although employment continued to expand in nonfarm sectors, unemployment increased due to the rising labor force participation, which was flat for some time.",
        "Industrial and services employment grew in this period, whereas construction employment declined.",
        "Industrial employment expanded at a stronger pace than in previous periods, providing the biggest contribution to nonfarm employment growth.",
        "Industrial production and survey indicators suggest that the industrial sector will contribute mildly to employment in the forthcoming period.",
        "The support from services was more limited due to the sluggish tourism industry.",
        "The contribution from the services industry to employment is expected to remain below early 2015 levels in the upcoming period.",
        "Thus, prospects for a robust employment growth are slim for the remainder of the year.",
        "The economic outlook and the waning investment tendency pose a downside risk to the labor market.",
        "To sum up, in the second quarter, external demand remained weak while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately.",
        "Current indicators suggest a similar outlook for the July-August period.",
        "Yet, uncertainties in global markets and the weak course of consumer and investor confidence add to the downside risks to growth for the upcoming period.",

        "Commercial loan growth remains robust while consumer loans continues to decelerate.",
        "Recent tightening in financial conditions is likely to have some slowing impact on loan growth in the upcoming period.",

        "Recent data releases signal no significant change in the macroeconomic outlook.",
        "The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global trade restrict the export growth.",
        "Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a modest upward trend driven mainly by consumption.",
        "Although available data point to an ongoing moderate growth for economic activity, recent developments necessitate close monitoring of forward-looking signals.",
        "Recently, rising risk premiums due to global and domestic uncertainty have led to a tightening in financial conditions.",
        "This, coupled with the already weak confidence indices, creates downside risks regarding the domestic demand for the second half of the year.",
        "Committee members stated that the inflation outlook has not displayed the desirable improvement yet.",
        "Although processed food and energy price developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, the cumulative exchange rate movements since early 2015 delay the recovery in the core inflation trend.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Committee stated that a slightly tighter monetary policy stance might be necessary to counterbalance the upside risks to inflation.",
        "The Committee indicated that the inflation outlook and the risks would be instrumental for the exact implementation of the monetary tightening.",
        "Due to the imminent economic slowdown, exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices will be more limited than implied by historical estimations.",
        "Moreover, falling commodity prices partly offset the exchange rate effect.",
        "Meanwhile, downside risks to global economy and domestic economic activity remain significant.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee agreed to adopt a flexible approach for the implementation of the monetary tightening at this point and follow the consequences closely to review the situation at the next meeting.",
        "In conclusion, given the uncertainty over domestic and global markets and the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to implement a tighter liquidity policy for as long as deemed necessary.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "The Committee also evaluated the strategy to be pursued before and after the global monetary policy normalization, and decided to implement policy measures in three dimensions: (i) interest rate and Turkish lira liquidity, (ii) FX liquidity, and (iii) policies regarding financial stability.",
        "It was concluded that, considering the current global and domestic circumstances, the policies need to be tight for the Turkish lira, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive for financial stability.",
        "The Committee decided to publish the related document on the website.",
        "A significant of the meeting focused on the simplification of the monetary policy framework.",
        "The Committee suggested that monetary policy framework may be simplified by gradually narrowing the interest rate corridor during global monetary policy normalization.",
        "It was stated that, eventually one week repo rate will assume the role of policy rate and represent the stance of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee underlined that structural measures to support financial stability are as important as the cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows.",
        "Accordingly, the published roadmap included measures to support the FX liquidity and to provide incentives for core liabilities and long-term borrowing.",
        "The Committee stated that the past measures on this front have already enhanced the resilience of the economy and that additional measures may further bolster these gains.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",

        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels.",
        "In February, consumer prices increased by 0.71 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.31 points to 7.55 percent.",
        "This increase was mainly driven by food prices.",
        "The decline in the annual inflation of non-food consumer prices has continued.",
        "Underlying inflation rose in services but fell in core goods.",
        "Overall, core inflation indicators continued to improve.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages surged by 2.73 points to 13.70 percent amid developments in unprocessed food prices.",
        "This period was marked by escalating vegetable prices caused by adverse weather conditions and supply-related upsurges in meat prices.",
        "On the other hand, despite the receding annual inflation in processed food prices, the monthly trend of increase remained elevated in this subcategory.",
        "Indicators for March signal that the annual food inflation will remain high.",
        "Annual energy inflation remained modest with a growth rate of -1.92 percent despite rising fuel prices and water tariffs.",
        "Yet, energy prices are expected to have a less constraining effect on annual consumer inflation due to soaring prices of fuel and bottled gas amid the Turkish lira depreciation in March.",
        "Prices of services were up by 0.68 percent in February while annual services inflation fell by 0.10 points to 8.63 percent.",
        "In this period, changes in food and oil prices as well as exchange rates exerted cost pressures on prices of services.",
        "Accordingly, the monthly rate of increase in catering prices accelerated due to rising food prices.",
        "Moreover, having declined since November, prices of transport services picked up slightly amid higher fuel prices while prices of some items sensitive to exchange rates surged notably.",
        "As a result, services inflation remained elevated throughout February.",
        "Annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.78 points to 6.79 percent in February.",
        "Annual inflation was down across all main categories, particularly in durable goods.",
        "The decline in annual core goods inflation was largely driven by base effects.",
        "Meanwhile, the monthly rate of increase in prices of core goods excluding clothing reflected the pass-through of the Turkish lira depreciation, although the recent weakening of domestic demand conditions has partially balanced off the exchange rate-driven cost pressures.",
        "Accordingly, the underlying trend of core goods inflation fell to a modest level in February.",
        "To sum up, (core) inflation indicators excluding energy and food continued to decline in February.",
        "Yet, the current course of food prices and the exchange rate developments are the key risk factors regarding the inflation outlook.",
        "Industrial production recorded a monthly decline of 1.4 percent in January.",
        "This was largely attributed to the slowdown in domestic demand growth and the weakening external demand as well as to the setbacks in the supply chain and construction activities caused by January’s adverse weather conditions.",
        "February’s PMI and Business Tendency Survey (BTS) data suggest that the weak course of industrial production has continued lately.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest that demand conditions do not yet reveal a significant recovery.",
        "In January, the production of consumer goods was lower than the previous quarter’s average, while the imports of consumer goods were on the rise.",
        "In this period, domestic sales of home appliances dropped.",
        "Similarly, sales of automobiles were down from the fourth-quarter average during the January-February period.",
        "Consumer confidence continued to weaken amid uncertainty over global markets.",
        "Among indicators for investments, the production and imports of machinery-equipment fell in January from the previous quarter’s average.",

        "Among variables related to construction investments, the production of minerals declined whereas the imports of minerals increased.",
        "After an upsurge starting in the second half of 2014, construction employment flattened in December.",
        "In sum, recent indicators suggest that private domestic demand has contributed moderately to growth albeit at a slower pace in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "According to the real measures of external trade indicators, the rebalancing process has not shown a notable improvement in January.",
        "During this period, non-gold exports were weaker than their fourth-quarter average, while non-gold imports were flat.",
        "The slowdown in exports was mostly due to the weak growth across Turkey’s major trading partners.",
        "However, the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Thus, the current account balance is expected to improve further throughout 2015.",
        "In December 2014, both total and nonfarm unemployment decreased.",
        "Although there was no robust employment growth in this period, the flat labor participation rate helped to bring unemployment rates down.",
        "Across nonfarm sectors, services employment increased whereas industrial employment recorded a slight fall.",
        "The PMI and BTS survey indicators that reflect actual and expected employment figures for firms were down in February 2015.",
        "Other indicators for the labor market point to no significant recovery in employment as of the first quarter of 2015.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that economic activity lost some momentum in the first quarter of the year.",
        "This slowdown was attributed to the weak external demand, the volatile financial markets and adverse weather conditions.",
        "As it is too early at this point to distinguish the negative impact of weather conditions, the Committee suggested monitoring the data closely for a while before making a more definitive assessment regarding the underlying trend of economic activity.",
        "The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators).",
        "The moderate course of aggregate demand conditions and the continued downtrend in import prices support disinflation as of the first quarter.",
        "In the short run, the annual rate of increase in core indicators is likely to decline further thanks to base effects.",
        "However, elevated food prices and the recent exchange rate movements will cause inflation to hover above the level indicated in the January Inflation Report for some time.",
        "Global markets continue to follow a volatile course.",
        "The reduced predictability regarding global economy, the low inflation rates across advanced economies, and the growing uncertainty along with the decoupling of monetary policies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive.",
        "As a result, the risk appetite and capital flows continue to be volatile.",
        "The Committee pointed out that the measures the CBRT has recently taken in terms of foreign exchange liquidity and prudent borrowing are to minimize macro financial risks arising from the uncertainty in global financial markets and global economic activity.",
        "In sum, the uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook.",

        "Any measure that would strengthen stability and confidence, ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline, and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates at low levels.",

        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.42 points to 14.12 percent.",
        "This was led by unprocessed food prices, and ongoing price hikes particularly in vegetables-fruits and meat stood out.",
        "On the other hand, annual inflation receded in processed food prices.",
        "Unfavorable influence of food prices to inflation continued with an increasing trend in this period and contribution of food group reached 3.47 points in annual inflation.",

        "Annual inflation of core goods decreased by 1.25 points to 5.54 percent in March.",
        "Annual inflation was down across all main categories, particularly in durable goods, largely due to the base effect.",
        "In the first quarter, pass-through of the exchange rate developments to core goods inflation under attenuated demand conditions proved limited.",

        "Despite the slowdown in domestic demand, the high course of food prices and the exchange rate developments are the key risk factors regarding the inflation outlook in the upcoming period.",
        "According to data released by TURKSTAT, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "Thus, annual growth ended 2014 at 2.9 percent.",
        "On the production side, the value-added from all sectors except construction posted year-on-year increases in the final quarter.",
        "Yet, over 2014, the agricultural value-added contributed negatively to annual growth due to drought-driven production losses, whereas value-added of construction, industry and services sectors expanded.",
        "On the spending front, the private demand for consumption and machinery-equipment investment added to growth in the fourth quarter, while the public sector made a weaker contribution.",
        "Net exports made a negative contribution to growth in this period as imports increased at a faster pace than exports.",
        "Over 2014, Europe’s sluggish growth and geopolitical tensions across neighboring countries dampened exports.",
        "However, imports nearly flattened on the back of the slowing rate of increase in domestic demand, making net exports the demand component that provided the highest contribution to growth in 2014.",
        "Data released for the first quarter of 2015 point to a relatively weak outlook for economic activity.",
        "Although industrial production recorded a monthly increase of 1.7 percent in February, the level of production remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2014 during January-February period.",
        "This outlook is mostly attributed to the slowdown in domestic demand growth and the weak external demand as well as to the setbacks in the supply chain and construction activities caused by adverse weather conditions in January and February.",
        "PMI and Business Tendency Survey (BTS) data suggest that this weak course will continue in March.",

        "The investment tendency failed to demonstrate a steady recovery in the first quarter of 2015, thus remaining weak.",
        "Against this background, private domestic demand is expected to slow down slightly and contribute moderately to growth in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "External demand indicators show that the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold, which came to a halt in the second half of 2014, has not shown an improvement as of January-February.",
        "This outlook is largely driven by the weak growth across Turkey’s trading partners and the slowing yet ongoing domestic demand growth.",
        "In fact, during this period non-gold exports were down, while non-gold imports increased from their averages in the previous quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",

        "Across nonfarm sectors, services employment continued to grow whereas construction employment maintained the negative pattern that started in December.",
        "On the other hand, after falling in previous months, industrial employment regained momentum, providing a major contribution to the fall in unemployment.",
        "To summarize, first-quarter data have yet to signal a recovery in economic activity.",
        "In this period, external demand weakened, but domestic demand is expected to contribute moderately to growth.",
        "However, the uncertainty over global markets and the weak course of consumer and investor confidence increase the downside risks to growth for the upcoming period.",

        "The weak external demand caused by the sluggish growth across European countries, the largest export market for Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries continues to limit the growth of exports.",
        "In addition to the weak external demand, the recent plunge in the value of the euro against the US dollar may have an adverse impact on firms that export in euro, but Turkey’s share in the European market remains robust.",
        "The recent signs of recovery for the European economy might be a development that would boost the external demand.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that economic activity lost some momentum in the first quarter.",
        "This slowdown was largely due to the weak external demand, volatility in financial markets and adverse weather conditions.",
        "Although economic activity is expected to grow gradually and moderately from the second quarter onwards, downside risks remain important.",
        "Lingering volatility in global financial markets and the weak course of confidence indices are the risk factors that may limit the contribution of the private sector final demand to growth.",
        "In case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down but at the same time lead to notable adverse effects on domestic economic activity.",
        "Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ the policy tools to support the economy.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term forecasts to be published in the April Inflation Report.",
        "The first quarter’s higher-than-projected annual consumer inflation compared to the January Inflation Report is mostly attributed to soaring food prices.",
        "Moreover, oil prices and TL-denominated import prices put cost pressures on inflation.",
        "Analyzing the assumptions and external conditions that underlie the inflation forecasts, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised upwards in view of oil prices, TL-denominated import prices and output gap developments.",
        "The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators).",
        "Low levels of international commodity prices and the moderate course of aggregate demand conditions support disinflation.",
        "The Committee expects the annual inflation of core indicators to decline further in the short run, with also contribution of base effects.",
        "However, the recent exchange rate movements may have an adverse impact on the core inflation outlook.",
        "Food prices remain as the main risk factor for the inflation forecast.",
        "Although food inflation is expected to remain high in the short term according to the baseline scenario, food prices are likely to see a notable correction upon the introduction of new-season products in the summer months.",
        "Moreover, measures that may be proposed by the Food Committee are assessed to contribute to the decline in the food inflation in the upcoming period.",
        "However, prices of some food items are sensitive to the exchange rate and there are uncertainties over supply-side developments, which necessitate caution against food inflation.",
        "Global markets continue to follow a volatile course.",
        "Reduced predictability of global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive.",
        "Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues.",
        "The Committee emphasized that measures recently taken in the FX liquidity, intermediation costs and prudential borrowing aimed at reducing macrofinancial risks stemming from uncertainties regarding global financial markets and the course of economic activity.",
        "Macro financial risks will be closely monitored in the upcoming period and additional measures will be taken when deemed necessary.",
        "In sum, the uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitate maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the pace of improvements in the inflation outlook.",

        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.83 points to 9.51 percent in November.",

        "Meanwhile, the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.67 percent in November.",

        "Orders over the last three months and three-month-ahead order expectations from BTS have been weakening in both exports and the domestic market.",

        "This loan outlook not only limits medium‐term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Moreover, the favorable developments in the terms of trade continue to support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Industrial production gained some momentum in the first quarter partly owing to the thriving vehicle production.",
        "Consumer confidence and investment tendency point to a moderate private domestic demand, while leading indicators suggest that external demand is relatively weak.",
        "Recent signs of recovery in Europe might be a development that would boost the external demand.",
        "However, lingering volatility in global financial markets and the weak course of confidence indices are the risk factors that may limit the contribution of the private final demand to growth.",
        "To sum up, external demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "Thus, the recovery in economic activity is expected to be gradual and aggregate demand conditions are expected to continue supporting disinflation.",
        "The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators).",
        "However, recently elevated volatility in the exchange rates has limited the improvement in the core inflation, as stated in the April Inflation Report.",
        "The moderate course of aggregate demand conditions and low levels of international commodity prices support disinflation but the recent fluctuations in energy prices curtail this contribution.",
        "Food prices, which are still at high levels, remain as the main risk factor for inflation.",
        "However, with the introduction of new seasonal products in summer months, food prices are likely to see a notable correction.",
        "Global markets continue to follow a volatile course.",
        "Reduced predictability of global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data‐sensitive.",
        "Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues.",
        "The Committee assessed that the measures taken to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities and long-term borrowing enhanced the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "Additional measures along these lines may continue to be taken if deemed necessary.",
        "In conclusion, the global market uncertainty and the unfavorable effects of the exchange rate volatility on core inflation coupled with the volatility in energy and food prices make it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium‐term inflation outlook.",
        "The implementation of the announced structural reforms is expected to contribute significantly to potential growth.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels.",
        "In June, consumer prices decreased by 0.51 percent, bringing annual consumer inflation down by about 0.9 points to 7.20 percent.",
        "With the ongoing correction in food prices, the decline in annual food inflation became more pronounced.",
        "Changes in crude oil prices drove energy inflation lower, yet the depreciation of Turkish lira constrained the disinflation.",
        "Core goods inflation was slightly up due to exchange rate effects while services inflation remained elevated.",
        "Thus, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core inflation indicators followed a flat course.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was down by 3.54 points in June to 9.28 percent.",
        "This decline was largely caused by unprocessed food prices, while annual processed food inflation continued to slow.",
        "May’s fresh fruit and vegetable-driven drop in seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices continued into this period at a stronger pace thanks to increased supply.",
        "However, red meat prices remained on the rise, affecting inflation negatively in associated categories such as processed food and catering services.",
        "After an upsurge since February, energy prices decreased by 0.17 percent in June, bringing annual energy inflation down by 0.6 points to 2.78 percent.",
        "The fall in energy prices was mostly attributed to bottled gas and fuel prices, while indicators for July point to a continued decrease in energy prices.",
        "Prices of services were up 0.88 percent in June while annual services inflation remained unchanged at 8.85 percent, mostly due to restaurants-hotels and other services.",
        "Annual inflation in rents and transport, on the other hand, decreased.",
        "Despite the significant correction in food prices over the past two months, annual restaurants-hotels inflation remained on the rise amid the ongoing upsurge in red meat prices.",
        "Meanwhile, annual inflation in the subgroup of other services increased due to rising prices of package holidays.",
        "As a result, underlying trend of services inflation remained flat at an elevated level.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 5.97 percent in June.",
        "Annual inflation was up in durable goods due to base effects but down in other main categories.",
        "The substantial April-May price hikes were replaced by a slowdown in June across categories where exchange rate pass-through to prices is relatively faster, such as home appliances and automobiles.",
        "Prices of automobiles increased only modestly, while prices of furniture and electric/nonelectric appliances went down.",
        "On the other hand, core goods excluding clothing and durable goods continued to reflect the effects of cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira.",
        "Hence, underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a small increase in June.",
        "Industrial production declined by 2 percent in May on a monthly basis.",
        "This fall stemmed mainly from the production loss led by strikes in the automotive sector.",
        "The lowering effect on industrial production of the contraction in the production of vehicles is expected to be compensated for in the coming months.",
        "On a quarterly basis, the production level in the April-May period is 1 percent higher than the average production in the previous quarter.",
        "Assessing the PMI and BTS data together, a strong rebound is not expected in industrial production in the second quarter.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest that production and imports of consumption goods increased in the April-May period compared to the average of the previous quarter.",
        "Domestic sales of home appliances recorded an uptick in this period.",
        "Likewise, sales of automobiles in the second quarter stood above the first-quarter average.",
        "Consumer confidence, on the other hand, continued to weaken due to geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global markets.",
        "Among investment indicators, production and imports of machinery-equipment posted a decline in the April-May period in comparison to the average of the previous quarter.",
        "Production and imports of mineral products, among the indicators for construction investment, registered an increase in the same period.",
        "Construction employment remained flat in April.",
        "Investment tendency maintained its sluggish course in the second quarter of 2015.",
        "Accordingly, domestic private demand is expected to contribute to growth moderately in the second quarter.",
        "Following the contraction in the first quarter, the export quantity index excluding gold increased at a modest rate in the April-May period compared to the previous quarter, while the import quantity index excluding gold maintained its upward trend.",
        "This suggests that the contribution of external demand to growth may be limited in the second quarter.",
        "The weak course of the global economy and the ongoing geopolitical developments put a cap on export growth.",
        "On the other hand, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "In April 2015, total and non-farm unemployment rates fell by 0.1 and 0.2 points, respectively.",
        "Employment in non-farm sectors rose while the increase in labor force was limited, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate.",
        "Employment in the industrial and services sectors rose, while construction employment fell in this period.",
        "Since the last quarter of 2014, non-farm employment growth has been driven by the services sector, while the industrial and construction employment have fluctuated around a flat trend.",
        "The industrial production and survey indicators suggest that the contribution of industrial sector to employment will be limited also in the upcoming period.",
        "Services employment is anticipated to grow at a slower pace in the upcoming period owing also to the stagnant tourism sector.",
        "Accordingly, unemployment is not expected to record a notable decline in the rest of the year.",
        "The current course of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency pose downside risks to employment.",
        "In sum, data on the second quarter of 2015 suggest a mild course in economic activity.",
        "External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "Meanwhile, geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global markets besides the weak course of consumer and investor confidence pose some risks to growth in the upcoming period.",
        "The Committee assessed the medium-term projections to be presented in the July Inflation Report.",
        "Inflation in the second quarter proved close to the forecasts of the April Inflation Report, while core inflation stood above the projections.",
        "In this period, the fall in food inflation became the main driver of the improvement in inflation, while core inflation rose mostly because of the exchange rate effects.",
        "Analyzing the assumptions and external conditions that underlie the inflation forecasts, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised slightly upwards in view of the developments in import and food prices besides the rise in core inflation driven by the exchange rate.",
        "The Committee assesses that that the partial recovery in food prices accompanied by the cautious monetary policy will limit the deterioration in the inflation outlook and inflation will reach the target in the medium term.",
        "Unprocessed food inflation had been quite unfavorable in the first quarter, leading inflation to post high figures.",
        "However, recently there has been a notable correction in food prices, which has affected inflation favorably.",
        "Similarly, the recent decline in oil prices supports disinflation.",
        "On the other hand, exchange rate movements have been especially influential in the core goods group, delaying the recovery in the core inflation trend.",
        "This delay, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy.",
        "The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the pace of improvements in the inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behaviors and other factors affecting inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "Besides the cautious monetary stance, additional foreign exchange liquidity measures may be adopted, if exchange rate movements continue to delay the fall in inflation.",
        "Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "Commercial loans have recently been following a robust course of growth, while consumer loans lost pace due to the items excluding housing.",
        "Additionally, commercial loans grow faster than consumer loans in line with the desired loan composition.",
        "Owing also to the recent partial tightening in financial conditions, total credit growth is expected to slow somewhat in the second half of the year.",
        "This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures, but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global trade restrict the export growth.",
        "Meanwhile, cumulative energy imports will continue to decline if the current low levels of oil prices are maintained.",
        "As a result, favorable developments in the terms of trade and the mild course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance, yet the relatively weak export outlook limits this recovery.",
        "Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a mild increase driven mainly by consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, the weak course of confidence indices coupled with domestic and external uncertainties are the risk factors that may restrict the contribution of the final private demand to growth.",
        "In this context, it is projected that the recovery in economic activity will be gradual, and the aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation.",
        "Risks to global markets remain significant.",
        "Reduced predictability of the global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive.",
        "Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues.",
        "The Committee underlined that, besides cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows, structural measures to enhance the resilience of the financial system are important as well.",
        "Accordingly, recent measures implemented to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities, and long-term borrowing have enhanced the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "The Committee has stated that additional measures along these lines may be adopted if deemed necessary.",
        "Following the global crisis, especially during the exit process of the US monetary policy, long-term rates in emerging economies have grown excessively sensitive to global monetary policies.",
        "The wide interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy implemented by the CBRT increased the resilience of our economy against global shocks during this period.",
        "In the upcoming period, following the start of normalization of global monetary policies, volatility in long-term interest rates may decline permanently thanks to forward guidance policies.",
        "According to this baseline scenario, the need for a wide interest rate corridor in our country may diminish over time.",
        "In that case, the operational framework of the CBRT’s interest rate policy may be simplified gradually.",
        "Members of the Committee asked the technical departments to complete the preparations in this direction and to present them in August meeting.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels.",
        "In May, consumer prices increased by 0.56 percent and annual inflation edged up by 0.2 points to 8.09 percent.",
        "Annual food inflation in this period declined owing to the correction in unprocessed food prices.",
        "On the other hand, energy prices maintained the upward trend amid the developments in crude oil prices.",
        "Being affected by the exchange rate developments, core goods inflation followed an upward course, while services inflation remained high.",
        "Accordingly, the underlying trend of core inflation indicators registered an increase due to core goods.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.55 points to 12.81 percent in May.",
        "This fall was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, and partly by the slowdown in bread and cereal products prices.",
        "Seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices registered a decline due to fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "Early indicators reveal that, amid the increase in product supply, correction in food prices will be more prononunced in June.",
        "Energy prices rose by 1.18 percent in May, and the group’s annual inflation recorded an uptick by 1.8 points and reached 3.38 percent mainly due to the low base.",
        "Domestic energy prices have been following an upward track since February.",
        "This rise is led both by the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the recovery in the international oil prices that hit the bottom in January.",
        "Prices of services rose by 0.77 percent, and the annual services inflation increased slightly to 8.85 percent in May.",
        "This was led by the price developments in restaurants-hotels and transport services, while annual inflation in other sub-groups remained relatively flat.",
        "Cumulative increases in food prices and the ongoing uptrend in meat prices pushed the inflation in restaurants-hotels group further upwards.",
        "Annual inflation in transport services have been receding since almost six months in line with the outlook in international fuel prices.",
        "However, upon the reversal of the downtrend in fuel prices, transport became another service item that recorded an increase in this period.",
        "Against this background, although remaining flat compared in May to the last month, the underlying trend of services stayed high.",
        "Annual inflation in core goods rose by 0.83 points to 5.88 percent in May.",
        "Among sub-groups, annual inflation in durable consumption goods rose by around 2 points to 4.66 percent in this period.",
        "Being led by the recent depreciation of the Turkish lira also against the euro, monthly price increases in durable consumption goods spread across all sub-groups, particularly home appliances and automobiles groups.",
        "Annual inflation was up in clothing, but declined in goods excluding clothing and durable goods.",
        "All in all, the seasonally-adjusted underlying trend of core goods inflation posted a significant increase mostly due to exchange rate pressures.",
        "According to TURKSTAT’s data, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 2.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "On the production side, the first quarter saw a yearly growth in the value added from non-construction industries.",
        "On the spending side, final domestic demand has increased due to private and public consumption demand.",
        "In this period, the ongoing yet slowing increase in domestic demand drove imports higher while net exports continued to make a negative contribution to annual growth amid declining exports caused by weak external demand.",
        "After the solid growth in February and March, industrial production remained unchanged month-on-month in April.",
        "On a quarterly basis, April’s production level is 2.1 percent above the quarter-ago average.",
        "Survey indicators suggest that there has recently been a slight recovery in the export orders.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand is expected to remain on a moderate upward trend.",
        "However, the May strikes, particularly those in the automotive industry, will cause output to drop across vehicle and base metal industries in this period.",
        "In fact, contrary to survey indicators, May survey data point to a plunge in non-gold exports driven by automotive industry exports.",
        "Thus, industrial production is expected to record a monthly fall in May.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest that private demand continues to rise in the second quarter, albeit more slowly.",
        "The production and imports of consumer goods grew faster in April than in the first quarter.",
        "Sales of home appliances and automobiles were up in the April-May period from their first-quarter average.",
        "Meanwhile, business survey indicators and consumer confidence indices point to a moderate domestic demand for the April-May period.",
        "Production and imports data related to non-vehicle investments remained flat in April.",
        "Likewise, indicators for the construction industry and companies’ expectations for future investments have yet to signal some recovery in investment spending.",
        "In sum, indicators on the second-quarter suggest that economic activity grows modestly, driven by private consumer demand.",
        "The terms of trade continues to affect the current account balance positively, which however is restrained by the sluggish exports.",
        "Leading indicators point to some increase in the seasonally-adjusted current account deficit in May.",
        "The improvement in the current account balance is expected to resume starting from June with the moderate course of consumer loans and lower energy prices.",
        "In March 2015, unemployment rates were down 0.1 point from the previous period in seasonally-adjusted terms.",
        "Amid non-farm employment losses, unemployment rates declined on falling non-farm labor force.",
        "In this period, construction employment increased whereas industrial and services employment fell.",
        "The drop in services employment mostly reflects a correction of the strong growth in previous months.",
        "Since the last quarter of 2014, non-farm employment growth has been driven by the services sector, while the increase in industrial and construction employment have been small.",
        "The industrial production tendency and survey indicators suggest that employment might see some recovery in the second quarter.",
        "Yet, other leading indicators have been signaling that non-farm employment gains are very limited, thus tempering any expectations of a significant decline in unemployment.",
        "The current pace of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency pose downside risks to employment.",
        "Loans continue to expand at a reasonable pace in response to the tight monetary stance and the macroprudential measures.",
        "The recent tightening in the overall financial conditions is expected to further slow down loan growth slightly in the second half of the year.",
        "The composition of loans continues to evolve in the desired direction, with commercial loans growing at a faster pace than consumer loans.",
        "In addition, consumer loans excluding home loans grow at a more modest pace.",
        "This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "The current course of global demand dampens the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "The economic recovery in Europe affects external demand positively but the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the slowing global trade will cause exports to remain weak for some time.",
        "The decline in cumulative energy imports is expected to have a further favorable impact on the current account balance, if the current levels of oil prices are maintained.",
        "Overall, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance, while the relatively weaker exports limit this improvement.",
        "The Committee stated that the inflation outlook has yet to display the desired improvement.",
        "Although a partial correction in food prices is expected to ease inflation in the short term, the recent exchange rate movements have delayed the improvement in core inflation.",
        "This, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy.",
        "The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.",

        "This fall was mainly driven by energy and food prices, yet inflation lost pace in almost all sub-groups.",
        "The decline in energy prices continued at a stronger pace in line with the international oil prices.",
        "The decline in the underlying trend in inflation got more apparent in services, but remained relatively limited in core goods.",
        "Annual food inflation decreased by 1.64 points to 12.73 percent and stood close to the assumptions made in the October Inflation Report.",
        "The seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a partial correction in unprocessed food prices in the last four months, which was led particularly by fruits and vegetables.",
        "Similarly, despite the deceleration in the monthly inflation trend in processed food prices in December after a long while, the group’s annual inflation remained high with 13.16 percent.",
        "Indicators for January signal for a possible decline in the annual food inflation due to the unprocessed food group.",
        "Energy prices remained on the decline and fell by 1.86 percent in December.",
        "The group’s annual inflation plummeted by 4.22 points to -1.54 percent, hitting the lowest level of the index history.",
        "The first-round effects of the decline in oil prices on energy prices appeared in fuel and bottled gas prices.",
        "Brent crude oil prices decreased approximately by USD 45 in the July-December period, and the direct effect of this decline on the consumer inflation through fuel and bottled gas prices was around -0.76 points in this period.",
        "This fall in these two items continued in January.",
        "Annual core goods inflation receded approximately by 0.5 points to 8.89 percent.",
        "This was led by prices of durables and the high-rated decline in clothing prices.",
        "Prices of durable goods edged down by 0.30 percent in December, and the downtrend in the group’s annual inflation continued.",
        "The sustained mild course of the prices of durable goods accompanied by the gradual elimination of the cumulative exchange rate effects suggests a notable decline in core goods inflation in the first quarter.",

        "In addition, the inflation trend in other services followed a weaker course in the last two months.",
        "The notable fall in oil prices is expected to have further positive effects on the prices of services that are closely related to fuel prices.",
        "The seasonally-adjusted data point to a sustained improvement in the underlying trend of core inflation indicators.",
        "The underlying trend in services inflation displays an evident decline, while the improvement in the trend of core goods inflation remained more limited.",
        "Data announced for the final quarter of 2014 point to a moderate recovery for economic activity.",
        "Having decreased by a mere 0.1 percent month-on-month in November, industrial production fell by 0.9 percent from the third quarter during October-November.",
        "This development stems largely from the weak external demand as well as the volatility caused by shifting holidays and transportation production.",
        "On the other hand, the recovery observed in other leading indicators suggests that the information content of the industrial production regarding the underlying trend of the fourth quarter economic activity might be limited.",
        "In fact, there have been widespread increases across nonfarm employment recently.",
        "Moreover, the import volume index for non-gold intermediate goods grew strongly during October-November, while non-gold exports increased only modestly.",

        "The Business Tendency Survey (BTS) and PMI indicators for manufacturing have shown a more robust growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, while the BTS’ three-month-ahead expectation for production and question of three-month-ahead total orders continued to improve in the fourth quarter.",
        "In this regard, the underlying trend of economic activity is considered to have recovered moderately.",
        "Data on the expenditure side point to some increase in private domestic demand for the fourth quarter.",

        "An indicator for investments, the production of machinery-equipment remained unchanged quarter-on-quarter, while its imports increased.",
        "Domestic sales of automobiles and light commercial vehicles grew robustly in the second half of 2014.",
        "Mineral production and construction employment, a proxy for construction investments, have registered moderate increases.",
        "Loans, on the other hand, remain on a modest upward track.",
        "Against this background, domestic demand is expected to recover further in the fourth quarter.",
        "The improved investment trend contains positive signals for investments over the upcoming period, but the weak consumer confidence poses a downside risk.",
        "External demand indicators point to no improvement for the fourth quarter of 2014 in the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold, which ground to a halt in the third quarter.",
        "Europe’s slowing economy and geopolitical tensions have caused exports to lose some pace.",
        "Thus, during October-November, exports excluding gold increased only slightly from the previous quarter, whereas imports excluding gold picked up at a relatively faster pace.",
        "However, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Having weakened after the first quarter of 2014, nonfarm employment posted notable gains during August-October period.",
        "Yet, this nonfarm employment growth has been balanced off by the growing nonfarm labor force participation recently, causing unemployment to remain steady.",
        "Employment growth was evident across all nonfarm sectors.",
        "Specifically, industrial and construction sectors are still experiencing growth in employment, which started in August.",
        "The services sector also has contributed further to nonfarm employment growth.",
        "As of October, actual data and leading indicators signal some recovery in employment for the fourth quarter, but considering the increase in labor force participation, unemployment rates are not expected to decrease.",
        "Loan growth is at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures.",
        "The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction.",
        "While the annual growth rate of consumer loans hovers around low levels, commercial loans remain relatively more robust.",
        "This loan composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) expects the growth composition to change in favor of domestic demand in the upcoming period.",
        "Ongoing weakness in growth across European countries, the largest export market of Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limits the growth of exports.",
        "Yet, with improved financial conditions and income effect of falling oil prices, domestic demand may see some recovery.",
        "In sum, external demand remains weak whereas domestic demand contributes moderately to growth.",
        "This change in the growth composition might lead to a widening in the non-energy current account deficit to some extent but the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow further down thanks to the improvement in the energy trade balance.",
        "Downside risks regarding economic activity continue to be important for the upcoming period.",
        "The lingering volatility across global financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices may cause private final demand to provide limited support to growth.",
        "In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down but at the same time lead to notable adverse effects on economic activity.",
        "Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ the policy tools to support the economic activity.",
        "There are many factors that might have a favorable effect on the inflation outlook for 2015.",
        "The recovery of economic activity is likely to be a gradual one and aggregate demand developments are expected to support disinflation.",
        "The tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially on inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) indicators.",
        "The adverse impact of cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation is also tapering off.",
        "Moreover, falling commodity prices, in particular oil prices, contribute to disinflation.",

        "Global financial markets have followed a volatile course recently.",
        "It was stated that capital flows to emerging markets may continue to be volatile in 2015.",
        "The ongoing uncertainty about the normalization of global monetary policies cause the global risk appetite and capital flows to be data-sensitive.",
        "The Committee stated that, against heightened global volatility, it would be helpful to pursue a flexible monetary policy in the short term and assessed that it would be appropriate to keep the overnight rates unchanged at this stage.",
        "The Committee stated that using a flexible interest rate corridor would cushion the economy against the volatility in global markets.",
        "In this regard, inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be further closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "The meeting also included a discussion of the projections to be published in the Inflation Report.",
        "Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that inflation will decline to levels close to the target by mid-2015.",
        "Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy.",
        "The Committee sees that a major opportunity has emerged to bring inflation down permanently in an environment where cost and demand factors are supportive of disinflation.",
        "Keeping inflation permanently at low levels might contribute to investments and potential growth.",
        "In this context, the Bank will continue to act decisively to bring down inflation and make future monetary policy decisions conditional on the pace of improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The Committee welcomed the development that the Medium Term Program incorporates disinflation as one of the main objectives.",
        "Moreover, it was indicated that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.",
        "Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In January, consumer prices increased by 1.10 percent and annual inflation fell by 0.93 point to 7.24 percent.",
        "This fall was mainly driven by energy and food prices, and inflation lost pace in almost all sub-groups except services.",

        "Processed food prices recorded a monthly upsurge, yet the group’s annual inflation receded to 12.56 percent also due to the high base.",
        "Being also affected by adverse weather conditions, the indicators for February signal a possible uptick in the annual food inflation due to the unprocessed food group.",
        "Energy prices remained on the decline and fell by 0.78 percent in January.",
        "The group’s annual inflation dropped by 1.50 points to -3.04 percent, hitting the lowest level of the index history.",
        "The effects of the decline in oil prices on energy prices appeared in fuel and bottled gas prices, while the upsurge in municipal water tariffs was remarkable.",
        "Meanwhile, the increase in fuel prices after six months in February due to the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the rise in oil prices indicates that the contribution of energy group to the decline in annual consumer inflation will be restricted to some extent.",
        "Annual core goods inflation edged down approximately by 0.3 points to 8.57 percent.",
        "This was led by prices of goods excluding clothing, particularly durable consumption goods.",
        "Although the group’s annual inflation decreased mostly owing to the base effect, prices surged across durables.",
        "In groups excluding durables and clothing, annual inflation decreased while there were increases in the monthly inflation.",
        "Recent exchange rate developments may restrict the fall in core goods inflation, yet a notable decline in core goods is expected in the first quarter.",
        "Prices of services increased by 1.06 percent and the group’s annual inflation crept up by 0.14 points to 8.73 percent mainly due to communication and other services groups.",
        "Moreover, maintenance-repair and healthcare services also saw an increase in inflation in this period.",
        "Additionally, the annual inflation in the restaurants-hotels group maintained its high course owing to the negative developments in food prices.",
        "Accordingly, the seasonally-adjusted data exhibit an increase in the underlying trend of services inflation.",

        "Core inflation is projected to decline further in the upcoming period in line with the maintained reasonable levels in inflation trends.",
        "Data announced for the final quarter of 2014 point to a limited recovery for economic activity.",
        "Industrial production increased 1.2 percent in December, but fell by 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter due to the volatility in other transport vehicles and the Feast of the Sacrifice.",
        "The dampening effects of the weak external demand have become more evident, while domestic demand has yet to accelerate adequately, which keeps economic activity from a robust recovery.",
        "According to data on the expenditure side, in the final quarter of 2014, the production of consumer goods was higher than the previous quarter’s average, while the decline in imports of consumer goods was limited.",
        "Domestic sales of automobiles and home appliances grew robustly.",
        "Loans, on the other hand, remained on a modest upward track.",

        "Mineral production and construction employment, variables related to construction investments, have registered some recovery.",
        "The investment trend that improved from the first half of 2014 contains positive signals for investments.",
        "Against this background, private domestic demand is believed to have increased moderately in the fourth quarter.",
        "External demand indicators suggest that net exports did not contribute to growth in the fourth quarter of 2014.",
        "The slowing growth rates across Turkey’s major trading partners and geopolitical tensions dampened export growth, while the modest recovery in domestic demand led to an increase in import demand.",
        "Thus, there has been no improvement for the fourth quarter of 2014 in the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold.",
        "However, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Data available for the first quarter of 2015 indicate that the fourth-quarter outlook will persist.",
        "January’s PMI and February’s Business Tendency Survey (BTS) indicators point to no acceleration in production.",
        "The increased volatility in financial markets and the weak consumer confidence restrain domestic demand.",
        "Moreover, external trade data for January show that exports remain weak due to external demand.",
        "According to seasonally adjusted data, unemployment picked up in November 2014 due to sluggish nonfarm employment.",
        "Construction employment has been recovering since August, yet the recent growth in industrial employment has been balanced off by a decline.",

        "The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction.",
        "The annual growth rate of commercial loans is quite strong relative to that of consumer loans.",
        "This loan composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "The weak external demand caused by the sluggish growth across European countries, the largest export market for Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limits the growth of exports.",
        "Yet, domestic demand may see some gradual recovery, also with the income effect of lower oil prices.",
        "In sum, external demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately.",
        "Thus, the growth composition may change in favor of domestic demand in the upcoming period.",

        "The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially on inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators).",
        "In this regard, the Committee anticipates that core inflation will continue to decline.",
        "Moreover, lower level of commodity prices, particularly oil, continue to support disinflation.",
        "However, the recent volatility in oil prices and exchange rates might limit the support provided by energy group to disinflation.",
        "Meanwhile, food prices may see some volatility, especially in unprocessed food, due to weather conditions.",
        "Having the foreseen decline in inflation to be more persistent is important for maintaining the progress made in inflation over the last decade.",
        "A persistent decrease in inflation will contribute to the fall in long-term real interest rates by leading to declines in risk and inflation premia.",
        "These developments will have a favorable impact on public balance and potential growth.",
        "In this context, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy.",
        "Taking into account the heightened volatility in food and energy prices, the Committee cut the interest rates but with a cautious approach kept the rate cuts at a measured scale.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook.",

        "The Committee emphasized that the CBRT has a rich set of policy tools to use against an earlier-than-expected policy rate hike by the Fed.",
        "Yet, higher risk of deflation in developed countries increases the probability of postponement in the normalization of monetary policies.",

        "In this period, annual inflation of core indicators and their seasonally adjusted underlying trend increased due to the core goods prices.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by around 1 point to 10.73 percent in September.",
        "This rise was led by unprocessed food inflation that reached 13.23 percent annually driven particularly by the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, most notably fruits.",
        "On the processed food front, the monthly price increase proved lower than the last two months with 0.63 percent and the downward trend in annual inflation continued.",
        "Leading indicators of October show that annual food inflation may decline due to the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Energy prices went up by 0.53 percent and amid the depreciation in the Turkish lira, the annual energy inflation rose by around 0.7 point to 1.95 percent in September.",
        "Prices of services rose by 0.79 percent in September, and annual services inflation edged down by 0.11 points to 8.54 percent.",
        "In this period, annual inflation increased in communication and other services, but decreased in transport and the restaurants-hotels groups.",
        "Due to the lagged effects of oil prices, annual transport service inflation maintained its slowing trend.",

        "Cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira has adversely affected prices in the core goods group, especially the durable goods in this period.",
        "Accordingly, prices of durable goods increased by 2.68 percent on a monthly basis, and price hikes particularly in automobiles and home appliances stood out.",
        "Moreover, prices of core goods excluding clothing and durables, where the exchange rate effects are observed with a relatively longer lag, also recorded an upsurge on a monthly basis.",
        "Thus, seasonally-adjusted indicators show a notable deterioration in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.",
        "October indicators point that exchange rate pressures continue to affect the prices of durable consumption goods.",
        "In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assessed that developments in energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, yet exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "In August, industrial production increased by 2.9 percent month-on-month, rising above the second-quarter average by 0.7 percent in the July-August period.",
        "However, current data signal a weak outlook for September’s industrial production.",
        "The 3 nonworking days due to the Feast of Sacrifice in September is expected to translate into a sharp drop in the annual percentage change of the raw data.",

        "The non-gold exports volume index is expected to increase in the third quarter whereas the imports index may decline in line with the weakening domestic demand.",
        "The growth composition is expected to shift gradually towards net exports over the upcoming period thanks to a rising demand from the EU countries.",
        "This composition change and the favorable developments in the terms of trade along with the moderate course of consumer loans support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Data for September and October indicate that the marked August improvement in the current account balance continues recently.",
        "In July, unemployment rates came down due to nonfarm employment growth.",
        "Services employment continued to make a sustained contribution to employment growth, while construction employment picked up after having fallen since the first quarter.",
        "Thus, the average annual employment growth equaled 3.4 percent for the January-July period.",
        "Industrial production and survey indicators suggest that industrial employment, which posted a modest increase in the first half, may fail to contribute to nonfarm employment growth in the third quarter.",
        "Being considered with other leading indicators, a moderate employment growth outlook is expected to continue in the upcoming period.",
        "To sum up, current indicators suggest that domestic demand is likely to be more moderate in the forthcoming period than in the first half of the year, while external demand might see some recovery.",
        "Uncertainties in global markets and the weak course of confidence indices add to the downside risks to the growth and employment outlook, yet the rebalancing in the growth composition supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Against this background, aggregate demand conditions are likely to support disinflation.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term forecasts to be presented in the October Inflation Report.",
        "In the third quarter, inflation surpassed the forecast of July Inflation Report due to food prices and exchange rate changes.",
        "Unprocessed food inflation increased, while core inflation remained high amid cumulative depreciation of the Turkish lira.",
        "Based on the assumptions underlying inflation forecasts and the external conditions, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised upward in view of revisions to import prices and the exchange rate-driven upsurge in core inflation.",
        "Inflation is expected to hover around current levels for some time due to the effects of the exchange rates and start declining afterwards.",
        "Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably.",
        "The negative impact of cumulative exchange rate developments since early 2015 on the inflation outlook is partly offset by lower oil prices.",
        "Food prices, on the other hand, remain volatile mainly due to unprocessed food prices, which poses both upside and downside risks to the year-end inflation forecast.",
        "The cumulative Turkish lira depreciation caused the annual core goods inflation to rise and the core inflation to deteriorate slightly.",
        "However, the tight monetary stance and the moderate domestic demand limit the exchange rate pass-through to prices compared to similar periods in previous years.",
        "Accordingly, considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "The Committee highlighted that loan growth has displayed a notable deceleration due to tighter financial conditions caused by recently increased domestic and external uncertainties.",
        "Specifically, commercial loans denominated in foreign currency and consumer loans have lost significant momentum.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures, but also helps to improve the current account balance.",
        "In addition to the moderate economic activity, rising loan rates and the tightening of other financial conditions also signal that loan growth may remain lower than past years’ averages in the upcoming period.",
        "Final domestic demand was the main driver of growth in the first half of 2015, while external demand remained weak.",
        "Indicators for the third-quarter point to a moderate economic activity, whereas the composition of growth hints at a slight slowdown in domestic demand and a recovery in exports.",
        "The weak consumer confidence and tighter financial conditions curb private consumption and investment demand.",
        "The slowing domestic demand and the changes in real exchange rates drive imports lower.",
        "On the exports front, despite the negative impact of geopolitical developments, the rising demand from EU members affects Turkey’s exports positively.",
        "Against this background, the Committee expects the growth composition to shift gradually in favor of net exports in the upcoming period.",
        "This shift is expected to have a positive impact on the current account balance.",
        "Moreover, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the sluggish course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance which became evident with the August figures is expected to continue.",
        "Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause financial markets to remain volatile.",
        "Thus, portfolio flows to emerging economies and risk indicators follow a highly volatile pattern.",
        "The Committee stated that the measures announced by the CBRT within the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies” boost the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "The current monetary policy stance is tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive of financial stability.",
        "In case that the decline in loan growth rates become permanent and exchange rates continue to face upward pressure over the upcoming period, in addition to preserving the tight monetary policy stance, the Committee may take measures to support the Turkish lira and loan growth by easing the conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels.",

        "Soaring fruit prices was the main driver of the increase in food inflation.",
        "Moreover, meat prices continued to increase, contributing to the upside movement in the unprocessed food inflation.",
        "On the processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued, but monthly price increase remained still high at 0.83 percent.",
        "Leading indicators on September inflation point that annual unprocessed food inflation may post another increase with rising fresh fruits and vegetables prices.",

        "In July, industrial production decreased by 1.5 percent month-on-month in seasonally adjusted terms, falling below the second-quarter average by 0.9 percent.",
        "This production drop is largely attributed to the correction of June’s sharp increase and the reduced number of working days due to factors such as bridge days.",

        "Accordingly, imports are expected to slow in the upcoming period.",

        "Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably.",
        "The upward impact of the exchange rate developments on inflation is partly offset by lower oil prices.",

        "February discounts lagged well behind historical averages in the clothing industry despite weaker output and external demand, whereas temporary tax cuts put a lid on price hikes in durable goods.",
        "Prices were also significantly higher across core goods other than clothing and durables due to the exchange rate pass-through as well as the increased customs duty on cosmetics.",
        "The cumulative depreciation of the Turkish lira may continue to put upward pressure on core goods inflation in March.",
        "In short, cost push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation.",

        "In fact, domestic demand seems to be slowing due to demand being brought forward in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the recent TL plunge and the weakening confidence.",

        "Economic activity is projected to display a slow gradual and slow rebound in 2017.",
        "However, the course of capital flows in line with uncertainties regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments, the subsided course of the labor market and the lingering volatility in exchange rates may stand out as factors to limit the pace of growth in 2017.",
        "Leading indicators and expectations regarding global economic activity have recently been favorable.",

        "Meanwhile, following a marked increase in 2016, global energy prices displayed a steady outlook in the last couple of months owing to favorable supply conditions in the energy market.",
        "Parallel to a tighter stance in January 2017, Turkey’s financial indicators have recorded an improvement.",
        "Recent losses in all indicators were mostly redeemed, which led to a positive divergence between Turkey and other emerging economies.",
        "Moreover, loan rates remain mild despite the rise in the CBRT funding rate; and the revival in loan growth continues due to the partial recovery in growth outlook, macroprudential arrangements and public incentives.",
        "In fact, consumer loans and TL-denominated commercial loan growth caught up with past averages.",
        "Domestic demand registered a recovery in the last quarter of 2016, yet sectoral diffusion of this recovery proved limited and the underlying trend of the economy exhibited a mild growth.",
        "Recent indicators show that the TL depreciation and the confidence channel have led to a deceleration in domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, owing both to waning uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets and the incentives supporting the economy, a mild economic growth is expected in the upcoming period.",

        "Excluding the offset work day losses of the third quarter, the fourth quarter was marked by a moderate growth.",
        "The TURKSTAT’s upward revisions to the first three quarters of 2016 showed that the level of economic activity was much higher than anticipated.",

        "Annual growth was driven by domestic demand in the last quarter of 2016.",

        "Following a robust increase in January, industrial production contracted in February.",
        "Rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira at the start of the quarter, uncertainties led by volatile financial markets and the leap in inflation are projected to dampen consumption and investment spending.",

        "In brief, the mild recovery in the underlying trend of economic activity continues, which is enhanced by supportive incentives and measures.",
        "Despite a partial recovery in domestic demand, net external demand spurs growth with robust increases in exports of goods that spill over into all sectors.",
        "The growing demand from the European Union economies, normalizing relations with neighboring countries, the course of the real exchange rate, and Turkey’s market-shifting flexibility abroad continues to stimulate exports.",
        "Increases in exports of goods translate into a decelerated deterioration in the current account deficit and improvement in core current account deficit indicators.",
        "In addition to the expected partial recovery in tourism, the robust course of exports of goods is expected to contribute positively to the current account.",

        "In this period, non-farm employment recorded an uptick particularly with the contribution from the services sector.",

        "Compared to the previous reporting period, indicators of economic activity point at a stronger global growth in 2017, owing especially to advanced economies.",
        "However, uncertainties over the Brexit process and blurred prospects for post-electoral economic policies in the US keep downside risks to global growth brisk.",
        "As of the first quarter of 2017, the upward trend in advanced economies’ long-term bond yields which started in November came to a halt, and portfolio flows to bond and stock markets of emerging economies resumed thanks to abated uncertainties over the Fed policy accompanied by optimistic expectations in financial markets.",
        "Although there is a slight recovery in recent global financial conditions, the pace of the Fed’s monetary tightening cycle will be the determining factor on the direction and volume of portfolio flows to emerging economies.",
        "Despite the relative improvement in global financial conditions, domestic financial conditions tightened slightly in the first quarter of 2017 due to the partly persistent volatility in the exchange rate market and the tightening in monetary policy.",
        "On the other hand, the Turkish lira has recently diverged positively from other emerging economy currencies and offset past losses to some extent.",
        "Moreover, macroprudential policies supporting the financial system, public incentives and public credit guarantees allowed credit conditions to continue to recover.",

        "Downside risks to economic activity have recently abated.",
        "The growth outlook for 2017 is expected to be more favorable compared to 2016 which was subject to numerous concurrent adverse shocks.",
        "The relative stability in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the favorable effect of the cumulative exchange rate depreciation on net exports, and the normalization of commercial relations with Russia will all contribute to growth.",
        "Moreover, measures and incentives to stimulate consumption and investment expenditures, fading perceptions of uncertainty and the improvement in the tightness of financial conditions will also enhance growth.",
        "Accordingly, economic activity is expected to strengthen as of the second quarter of the year.",
        "On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute downside risks to growth in 2017 as well as it has recently.",
        "Consumer inflation has surged since November 2016 and rose above the upper band of January forecasts.",
        "The upward trend in inflation was largely driven by the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the rise in import prices in addition to the increase in food prices.",
        "The rapid depreciation in the Turkish lira spread across the consumer price index, particularly to energy and durable goods items.",
        "The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the April Inflation Report in the meeting.",
        "Year-end inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were revised upwards by 0.5 and 0.4 points, respectively, compared to the 2017 January Inflation Report.",
        "Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target.",
        "Accordingly, inflation is likely to be 8.5 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term after falling to 6.4 percent in 2018.",
        "As also indicated in the previous Report, due to the base effects stemming from the prices of unprocessed food, tobacco and clothing as well as temporary tax reductions, consumer inflation will fluctuate throughout 2017.",
        "Inflation is expected to reach the highest levels in April-May particularly due to the base effect from unprocessed food and the lagged effects of the exchange rate, and then to fall thereafter as the impact of last year’s price increases in energy, alcohol-tobacco products and food gradually diminishes.",
        "The tight monetary stance will support the disinflation process.",
        "Aggregate demand conditions on which medium-term inflation forecasts are based, continue to have a disinflationary effect albeit at a more limited extent in comparison with the January Report.",
        "The upward revision in last year’s national income data and the acceleration in credit indicate that the recovery in economic activity might be stronger than expected.",
        "However high levels of unemployment rates suggest that the demand-side risks on inflation are balanced.",
        "The effects on aggregate demand conditions, of production and employment incentives and measures to boost the credit market, will be closely monitored in the upcoming period.",
        "Risks to food inflation – another major determinant of inflation forecasts – are considered to be on the upside.",
        "Due to the recovery in the exports of food products and the impact of the exchange rate developments, food inflation might exceed current projections, which are based on the assumption that measures taken by the Food Committee will considerably balance the upside risks to food prices.",
        "Although the recent improvement in the risk appetite contains some of the upside pressures from cost factors, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook, and raised the Late Liquidity Window lending rate from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent in its April meeting.",
        "Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "The CBRT formulates monetary policy in consideration of the medium-term inflation outlook, thus, focuses on the developments in the underlying trend of inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations in inflation driven by the base effects during the course of the year.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework and have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "Countercyclical fiscal policy has been implemented recently, thanks to the space provided by fiscal discipline.",
        "Structural measures, which would improve the potential to implement countercyclical fiscal policy, will contribute to the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and thus support macroeconomic stability.",
        "In December, consumer prices were up 1.64 percent, while annual inflation rose by 1.53 points to 8.53 percent.",
        "As stated in December’s Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, annual food inflation soared amid higher unprocessed food prices, while energy inflation continued to climb due to the outlook for exchange rates and oil prices.",
        "In addition, recent tax adjustments, particularly on tobacco, put a marked upward pressure on inflation.",
        "Moreover, the plunging Turkish lira drove the annual inflation and underlying trend of core indicators higher.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages surged by 2.10 points to 5.65 percent, largely due to unprocessed food prices rising amid adverse weather conditions and exchange rate developments.",
        "Annual processed food inflation remained virtually flat.",
        "Leading indicators for January signal a continued uptrend in annual food inflation on the back of unprocessed food prices.",
        "Energy prices increased by 2.15 percent in December, with the upswing spread across all subcategories due to soaring oil prices and the tumbling Turkish lira.",
        "Thus, annual energy inflation increased by a total of 5.70 points in the last four months to 8.67 percent.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that energy inflation has remained on the rise over January due to exchange rate changes.",
        "Prices of services edged up by 0.38 percent, while annual services inflation rose by 0.17 points to 8.11 percent in December.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in transport, remained almost flat in communication and went up in other subcategories.",
        "The slowdown in domestic demand and the sluggish tourism industry spilled over into prices of services, while several subcategories reflected the effects of the Turkish lira depreciation.",
        "Annual core goods inflation inched up by 0.84 points to 6.77 percent in December.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in clothing, but increased in other subcategories.",
        "Among durables goods, all subcategories, home appliances in particular, saw considerable price hikes.",
        "Automobile prices were affected by the SCT hike, along with exchange rate developments.",
        "The depreciation in the Turkish lira was evident in core good prices in December despite restrictive domestic demand conditions.",
        "Although aggregate demand conditions put a downward pressure, inflation is expected to remain on an upward track in the short term due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through and volatile unprocessed food prices.",
        "Recent data indicate that economic activity rebounded somewhat in the fourth quarter after the third-quarter deceleration.",
        "Despite a mild production growth across exporting industries, sectors with a relatively higher sensitivity to domestic demand weakened, causing industrial output to remain flat in November.",
        "Data on the production of electricity and vehicles and exports point to a modest growth in industrial output for December.",
        "Thus, industrial production is likely to post a quarterly gain in the fourth quarter thanks to the base effect coming from working day adjustment.",
        "However, apart from the technical recovery driven by working day effects, there is only a moderate recovery in economic activity which is not evenly spread across all sectors.",
        "Current data indicate the external demand was more robust than domestic demand in the fourth quarter.",
        "Non-gold exports were up quarter-on-quarter in the October-November period, while non-gold imports edged down.",
        "Likewise, the PMI’s new export orders rose above the neutral mark in the fourth quarter, while total orders posted a small quarterly gain.",
        "In this period, domestic sales of automobiles and home appliances were robust amid brought-forward demand, whereas the demand for services was on the decline, particularly in retail.",
        "Economic activity is expected to recover further amid accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "The data on mortgage and auto markets accompanied by the recent recovery in consumer loans bolster the projections for a gradual improvement.",
        "Moreover, the public sector is expected to provide further investment support to growth in the coming months.",
        "The growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in particular.",
        "Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying markets continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand.",
        "Furthermore, the newly-restored relations with neighbor countries translated into a boost for exports.",
        "The sluggish outlook in tourism sector continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of loans.",
        "However, commodity prices are expected to gradually have a less of a positive influence on the current account deficit in the upcoming period.",
        "The deterioration in the labor market, which began in May, continued through October.",
        "This period saw modest increases in services and industrial employment in contrast to a decline in the construction sector.",
        "Meanwhile, leading indicators such as new job vacancies and unemployment insurance claims suggest that employment remains subdued and unemployment rates will continue to remain high.",
        "In sum, economic activity slightly recovered in the fourth quarter and is expected to record a moderate growth in 2016.",
        "However, reverberations of recent market volatility through confidence channel, the potential impact of recent global and geopolitical developments on financial conditions and the lack of any signs of improvement in tourism outlook limit the pace of economic recovery.",
        "Following the US elections in November 2016, global economic uncertainties intensified.",
        "In this period, long-term interest rates increased in advanced economies, while capital flows towards emerging economies subsided.",
        "The increased likelihood of the adoption of protective policies in the US following the elections poses a downside risk to the pace of growth and employment in emerging economies.",
        "In addition, the increased possibility of accommodative fiscal policies to be adopted by the US may lead to accelerated rate hikes by the Fed, which may result in further tightening of financial conditions in emerging economies.",
        "Not only the ongoing uncertainties in global markets but also the geopolitical and domestic developments caused fluctuations in domestic financial markets in the fourth quarter of 2016.",
        "The adverse impact of these on financial conditions are partially counterbalanced through liquidity measures, macroprudential policies and other incentives.",
        "In fact, consumer loans and TL-denominated commercial loans have recently been signaling for recovery.",
        "On the other hand, tax arrangements done in the last quarter of the year, coupled with exchange rate developments led the demand for automobiles and durable goods to be brought forward at end-2016.",
        "Thus, the revival in consumer loans may lose some pace in the first quarter of 2017.",
        "Recently-released data hint at a noticeable economic slowdown in the third quarter of the year.",
        "Thanks to the accommodative incentives and measures, domestic demand recorded an improvement in the last quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, sectoral diffusion of this improvement remained limited and underlying trend of economic activity registered a mild growth.",
        "Recent indicators suggest that the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the repercussions through confidence channel may lead to a slowdown in domestic demand in the first quarter of the year.",
        "However, as uncertainties and volatility in financial markets wane, the economy is expected to revert to its underlying trend in the ensuing period and display a moderate growth in 2017.",
        "On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, the global economic outlook, uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of advanced economies and geopolitical developments pose downside risks to the economic activity, while possible lagged effects of recent incentives and measures are considered as the upside risk factor.",
        "Retaining price stability as the main objective, the CBRT closely monitors also the reverberations of the downside risks to economic activity on financial stability.",
        "The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the January Inflation Report in the meeting.",
        "In the last quarter, inflation increased due to the energy, alcohol-tobacco and unprocessed food groups.",
        "Although aggregate demand conditions continued to be disinflationary, rises in the exchange rate and commodity prices increased the underlying trend of core inflation.",
        "In the short term, the base effect from unprocessed food prices and developments in the TL-denominated import prices are expected to drive inflation upwards significantly.",
        "Hence, it is projected that despite the restrictive effect of the mild course of aggregate demand, inflation will remain high for a while due to cost pressures, and display a gradual decline as of the second half of the year.",
        "Forecasts are based on the assumption that despite the tourism-induced slowdown in food demand and the support from the actions taken by the Food Committee, the base effect from unprocessed food prices, the probable effects of the adverse weather conditions on the food supply and the exchange rate developments will push the end-2017 food inflation upwards compared to the figures of the previous report.",
        "Accordingly, year-end inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were revised upwards by 1.5 and 1 points, respectively compared to the October Inflation Report.",
        "Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is likely to be 8 percent in 2017, 6 percent in 2018 and stabilize around 5 percent in 2019.",
        "There are both downside and upside risks to inflation forecasts, yet upside risks to end-2017 inflation forecast seem more evident.",
        "Recently, the marked rise in foreign exchange market volatility poses an upside risk to inflation from expectations and pricing behavior channels as well as from the cost channel.",
        "On the other hand, the projected disinflationary effect of demand conditions may be higher, if economic activity recovers slower than expected in the period ahead.",
        "Risks to food inflation -another factor shaping forecasts- are considered to be balanced.",
        "Despite the possibility of food inflation to prove higher than expected still resides amid adverse weather conditions and the reverberations of the exchange rate, measures taken by the Food Committee are believed to counterbalance these risks.",
        "The CBRT will closely monitor the developments regarding inflation outlook and continue to take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.",
        "Against this background, starting from January 2017, the CBRT took a series of liquidity measures in response to the excessive exchange rate volatility and deterioration in the inflation outlook and decided to strengthen the tight monetary policy stance in the January MPC Meeting.",
        "In this respect, the marginal funding rate and the late liquidity window lending rate were hiked by 75 and 100 basis points to 9.25 and 11 percent, respectively.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Moreover, necessary liquidity measures will be taken in case of unhealthy pricing behavior in the foreign exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals.",
        "The fact that the excessive volatility observed in the foreign exchange market in January 2017 was not accompanied by a change in macro framework or economic fundamentals, required a dynamic tightening practice inclusive of alternative liquidity instruments.",
        "While a simple policy framework enhances the effectiveness of transmission mechanism, it does not rule out these type of dynamic reactions.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The contribution of adjustments in administered prices to consumer inflation in 2016 was above historical averages.",
        "This emerged as one of the main determinants of higher inflation than the CBRT’s forecasts issued at the start of the year.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "Moreover, the room provided by the fiscal discipline facilitates the countercyclical implementation of the fiscal policy in periods of slowing economic activity without a permanent deterioration in budget balances, as in 2016.",
        "Nevertheless, designing public spending and tax policies in a way that takes into account the subsequent effects on macroeconomic variables other than fiscal accounts such as growth, domestic savings and inflation, will contribute to the coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy, and enhance macroeconomic stability.",
        "In August, consumer prices were up 0.52 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.89 points to 10.68 percent.",
        "Inflation recorded a spike in food and energy and remained elevated in services.",
        "Clothing and durable goods sent inflation soaring across core goods, pushing the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators higher.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.9 points to 11.97 percent in August due to both a negative base effect from unprocessed food prices and widespread upsurges of processed food prices.",
        "Leading indicators for September signal that annual food inflation will remain on the rise mainly due to the base effect from unprocessed food.",
        "Energy prices jumped by 2.03 percent in August amid price developments in oil and other inputs.",
        "Thus, having been on an upward track for the last two months, annual energy inflation amounted to 10.54 percent.",
        "Prices of services rose by 0.73 percent while annual services inflation remained high at a virtually unchanged 9.40 percent in August.",
        "In this period, inflation was higher across catering and accommodation services due to rising food and beverage prices as well as the recovering tourism.",
        "Other drivers of high services inflation include soaring costs and indexation to headline inflation.",
        "In fact, prices of educational services, which are largely inflation-indexed, surged by 2.79 percent, driving annual inflation up to 10.30 percent in this subcategory.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.22 points to 11.08 percent in August.",
        "Clothing and durable goods prices drove annual inflation higher amid the Turkish lira’s slide against the euro and the strong economic activity.",
        "With the methodology change for clothing factored in as well, inflation seems to be on the rise for the last two months.",
        "Among durable goods, price hikes were more prevalent in furniture, automobiles and home appliances, yet monthly price increases continued to slow across core goods excluding clothing and durable goods.",
        "Indicators for September hint at continued uptrend in core goods inflation, albeit mainly due to the methodology change in the weight system for the clothing category.",
        "In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators pose risks to the pricing behavior.",
        "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew annually 5.1 percent and quarterly 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017.",
        "Economic activity was thus stronger than in the first quarter.",
        "The upward revisions to the data of previous periods were also considered as signs of an even stronger economic activity leading to the conclusion that the disinflationary contribution of demand conditions has reduced significantly as of the second quarter.",
        "The main driver of quarterly growth in this period was domestic demand, particularly construction investments and private consumption.",
        "Net exports made a negative contribution to quarterly growth due to the domestic demand-led upswing in imports and weaker exports, yet continued to boost annual growth.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that economic activity remained robust in the third quarter.",
        "July’s industrial production data and the PMI data for August signal stronger growth in the third quarter compared to the previous one.",
        "Not only the manufacturing industry, but also services, retail trade and construction saw strengthening activity recently.",
        "Accordingly, economic recovery appears to be more widespread across sectors.",
        "A similar outlook is also evident in demand indicators.",
        "The consumer demand for categories subject to incentives remains robust while investments edged up in the second quarter after a subdued first quarter.",
        "Domestic demand is likely to make more contribution to growth in the third quarter.",
        "Given the strengthening economy as well as the calendar and base effects, the Committee expects a sizable annual growth for the third quarter.",
        "Domestic demand keeps recovering while net external demand spurs growth thanks to increases in exports of goods that spill over into a wide range of sectors.",
        "The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports.",
        "Increases in exports of goods slow down the deterioration of the current account deficit and help improve core current account deficit indicators.",
        "In addition to the expected partial recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.",
        "The uptick in the labor market, which started in February and March, continued in June period.",
        "In this period, nonfarm employment was up on account of services.",
        "Leading indicators signal further gradual decreases in unemployment rates over the upcoming period amid economic recovery.",
        "In short, recently released data indicate that the recovery in economic activity has gained strength.",
        "Domestic demand conditions keep improving and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports.",
        "The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to potential growth significantly.",
        "Global economic activity has recently settled on a trend of recovery due both to advanced and emerging economies.",
        "The optimistic outlook in the consumer and the real sector confidence indices, ongoing favorable conditions in global financing and stabilizing commodity prices also underpin the positive outlook in global economic activity.",
        "Leading indicators for the third quarter hint at a better growth performance than the second quarter, which lead to upward revisions in the year-end growth projections for 2017.",
        "While communications by advanced economy central banks regarding the normalization of monetary policies occasionally cause short-term market volatility, the monetary policy normalization process has remained moderate because of still low global inflation rates.",
        "The elevated risk appetite and the subsided volatility in global financial markets along with favorable figures regarding global growth, keep portfolio inflows to emerging economies brisk including Turkey.",
        "Despite the current favorable outlook in global economic activity, downside risks to global economy reside as well.",
        "In particular, should the normalization process of the Fed’s policy-rate increase and the balance sheet downsizing prove faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may reverse.",
        "That may generate fluctuations in prices of securities in advanced economies and weaken the growth trend.",
        "Moreover, fading risk appetite also led by geopolitical developments may cause fluctuations in portfolio flows to emerging economies as well.",
        "In line with the upbeat mood in global financial markets, domestic financial conditions also continued to be supportive of economic activity in the third quarter.",
        "This was driven by macroprudential policies, public measures and incentives, as well as the credits secured by the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which improved overall credit conditions.",
        "As the upper limit defined in credits secured by the CGF becomes near and the supply-side effects have recently stepped in the banking sector, credit growth is balancing at milder levels, approaching past averages in the third quarter.",
        "The strong acceleration in credits in the first half of the year is monitored closely with regard to the extent of its impact on the aggregate demand and economic activity.",
        "Recently-released indicators confirm the previous view that downside risks to economic activity have abated and the economic recovery will prove more robust starting from the second quarter of the year.",
        "Third-quarter indicators reveal an ongoing robust economic activity.",
        "Exports remain buoyant despite some deceleration, and investments signal for recovery on the back of the sustained improvement in domestic demand.",
        "Annual growth in the third quarter is likely to prove quite high due to the calendar and base effects.",
        "The remainder of the year is anticipated to witness a milder trend in economic activity due to the fading effects of the CGF support on growth and the withdrawal of the tax incentives on consumption expenditures.",
        "Assessing the data on economic activity and the labor market jointly suggests a subsided disinflationary support from demand conditions in some sectors.",
        "Base effects in the food group, temporary tax reductions in white goods and the furniture sector that will be taken back in October as well as the methodological changes stand out as factors that will lead to fluctuations in inflation in the short term and temporary increases in core inflation.",
        "The inflation outlook is projected to improve gradually starting from the last months of the year, yet the pace and quality of this improvement will be monitored closely.",
        "Against this background, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy in its September meeting and kept the Late Liquidity Window lending rate constant at 12.25 percent.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",
        "In September, consumer prices were up 0.65 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.52 points to 11.20 percent.",
        "Annual inflation recorded a decline in the energy group due to the base effect, but increased in other subgroups.",
        "Food inflation increased due to the negative base effect in the unprocessed food group coupled with the spike in the processed food prices.",
        "Core goods and services groups witnessed overall price hikes, while the rise in the clothing group is mainly attributed to the methodological change in the weighting system.",
        "These developments pushed both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators higher.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 0.53 points to 12.50 percent in September.",
        "Both unprocessed and processed food prices recorded higher annual inflation rates.",
        "While this outlook on unprocessed food inflation was triggered by the base effect, the red meat prices are decreasing amid the measures in effect and seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices have been on the decline for the last three months.",
        "Leading indicators for October hint at a sustained downtrend in unprocessed food prices.",
        "On the energy front, prices jumped in September amid price developments in oil and other inputs, and this trend continued in October.",
        "Prices of services rose by 1.04 percent and the annual services inflation reached 9.55 percent in September.",
        "Price hikes spread across subgroups, and particularly striking were those in accommodation services and rent.",
        "Largely indexed to headline inflation, prices of educational services increased at a high rate in September as in August.",
        "Climbing inflation in services was driven both by increased costs and indexation to past inflation besides the robust course of economic activity.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.62 points to 12.70 percent in September.",
        "All subgroups, chiefly the clothing group saw higher annual inflation in this period.",
        "The recent upward course of core goods inflation was led by the lagged effects of the exchange rate, the strong course of economic activity and the clothing-driven methodological effects.",
        "The change in the weighting structure in clothing was mostly manifested itself in this period and accounted for nearly half of the rise in annual inflation in core indicators.",
        "Among durable goods, price hikes were more prevalent in automobiles and home appliances, and monthly price increases in core goods excluding clothing and durable goods gained momentum.",
        "Indicators for October hint at an ongoing uptrend in core goods inflation.",
        "The termination of the temporary tax reductions in white goods and furniture sector will also have a role in this uptrend.",
        "In addition, the weight update for clothing prices may still put upward pressure in October, albeit to a lesser degree.",
        "In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and the developments on core inflation outlook continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.",
        "Recently released data indicate a strong economic activity.",
        "July-August data on industrial production and September’s survey indicators suggest that industrial activity remains strong yet somewhat slower than in the second quarter.",
        "As growth becomes more widespread across sectors, indicators for services and trade have also recorded substantial gains; the recovery in the tourism sector helped boost the economic activity, as well.",
        "A similar outlook is also evident in demand indicators.",
        "Private consumption props up growth, while machinery and equipment investments have been increasingly displaying signs of recovery following a long spell of weak growth.",
        "Domestic demand is expected to provide added support to growth in the third quarter.",
        "The Committee reiterated that annual growth will be much faster in the third quarter owing to strengthening economic activity as well as calendar and base effects.",
        "The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports.",
        "Despite that a slight deterioration in the current account deficit is expected in the next few months due to the recovery in domestic demand and base effects, the strong recovery in tourism and the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.",
        "The labor market improvement halted in July.",
        "In this period, construction employment increased whereas employment in industry and service sectors dropped compared to the previous period.",
        "Thus, despite the strong economy-wide growth, the labor market displayed only a partial recovery.",
        "Survey data suggest that the weak July outlook was only temporary.",
        "Still, the Committee noted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the strong upward trend in the labor force participation rate.",
        "In short, economic activity was robust in the third quarter.",
        "Domestic demand conditions keep improving and the improving external demand, primarily from European Union economies, continues to contribute positively to exports.",
        "The Committee assesses that the implementation of structural reforms would contribute to potential growth significantly.",
        "The global economic upturn is expected to continue in the rest of 2017 and throughout 2018.",
        "Although financial market volatility slightly increased in the third quarter, global financial conditions remain accommodative as the risk appetite is still strong.",
        "Despite the third quarter’s higher crude oil prices driven by the benign global growth outlook, the OPEC output cut and the hurricanes that hit the US oil production, demand and supply-side factors specific to the oil market are containing the upward pressures on energy prices.",
        "On the other hand, risks related to other commodity prices are on the upside due to the global growth outlook.",
        "The primary downside risk to the global economic outlook is the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy normalization across advanced economies.",
        "The communication after the September meeting reinforced financial market expectations that the Fed will stick to its previously announced path of normalization.",
        "The Fed started reducing the size of its balance sheet in October.",
        "If the impending balance sheet downsizing of the Fed and other major central banks is introduced faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may be reversed.",
        "In addition to these uncertainties regarding global economic policies, the lack of a clear-cut Brexit strategy, the tendency towards more inward-oriented policies in European economies and the ongoing geopolitical turmoil in Asia and the Middle East stand out as other upcoming downside risks to financial markets and global growth.",
        "The fact that the size of private sector debt has reached high levels across some emerging economies, with China in the lead, might aggravate the impact of the risks related to financial markets.",
        "The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite prompted an upturn in portfolio flows toward emerging economies recently, but heightened geopolitical risks caused portfolio investments to lose momentum in Turkey.",
        "Turkey’s portfolio inflows have been more concentrated in government bonds since September whereas flows to the stock market remained volatile and weak.",
        "The volatility in the foreign exchange market triggered a rise in long-term inflation compensation.",
        "Despite these developments, financial conditions remained mostly accommodative in the third quarter.",
        "Loan growth balanced at historical levels in the third quarter, as the loans guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund almost reached the pre-determined upper limit.",
        "The strong acceleration of credit growth in the first half of the year and its phase-out in the second half are monitored closely with regard to their impact on aggregate demand and economic activity.",
        "The third quarter’s economic activity and aggregate demand were mostly in line with the predictions of the previous Report.",
        "After the third quarter, domestic demand might see some slowdown due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the termination of tax incentives for durable goods, and the economy is expected to move towards its underlying trend.",
        "Both the subsiding effect of the accommodative policies of 2017 and the fiscal measures announced in the recent Medium Term Program (MTP) are monitored closely with respect to their effect on economic activity.",
        "The continued recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel.",
        "The improving perceptions regarding uncertainty will continue to bolster investment in the next quarter, as in the third quarter.",
        "As the recovery becomes widespread, it is expected that favorable tendency will take place in employment and investment, upholding economic growth.",
        "Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain key to economic activity.",
        "Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to the economic activity.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be presented in the final Inflation Report of the year.",
        "Accordingly, year-end inflation forecast was revised upwards by 1.1 points for 2017, and 0.6 points for 2018, compared to the 2017 July Inflation Report.",
        "Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target.",
        "Accordingly, inflation is likely to be 9.8 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term after falling to 7 percent by the end of 2018.",
        "Following the July Inflation Report, the rise in commodity prices, particularly for oil and metals, and exchange rate changes drove inflation higher through the cost channel, causing core inflation indicators to exceed forecasts.",
        "Inflation is expected to remain high in October and November before coming down markedly to a still elevated level in December amid base effects.",
        "Base effects from food prices, the termination of temporary tax cuts for home appliances and furniture in October and the methodology change for clothing are the factors that will cause inflation to fluctuate in the short term and core inflation to rise briefly.",
        "The inflation outlook is expected to improve gradually from December onwards.",
        "The current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior.",
        "These risks and the high levels of inflation expectations might dampen the expected improvement in the inflation outlook from December through the first months of 2018.",
        "The fact that inflation expectations and the pricing behavior show no sign of improvement jeopardizes the inflation outlook.",
        "All these developments necessitate the maintaining of the tight monetary policy stance.",
        "Against this background, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance in its October meeting and kept the Late Liquidity Window lending rate constant at 12.25 percent.",
        "The Committee strengthened gradually the caution level of its monetary stance with the communication conducted in September and October.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets.",
        "Accordingly, the monetary policy will aim to bring inflation down to 7 percent at end-2018 before gradually falling to 5 percent.",
        "Consequently, with the current reading of the data, this stance requires that the tight monetary policy be preserved until a convincing fall in the trend of inflation is reached.",
        "The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year.",

        "The Committee will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",
        "In June, consumer prices were down 0.27 percent and annual inflation decreased by 0.82 points to 10.90 percent.",
        "Food inflation dropped on the back of fresh fruits and vegetables while annual energy inflation continued to decelerate.",
        "The lagged effects of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation continued to weigh upon core goods whereas annual core goods inflation declined due to prices of durable goods.",
        "There is an improvement in underlying inflation in this period, even after adjusting for the transient effects of the methodology change in the clothing price index.",
        "Prices of services rose by 0.53 percent while annual services inflation inched up by 0.12 points to 9.18 percent in June amid factors such as rising transport prices driven by the lagged effects of increased fuel prices, and higher catering prices due to the indirect effects of increased food inflation, particularly in red meat.",
        "In addition to cost increases driven by exchange rates, fuel prices and food prices, factors affecting services inflation also include indexation to headline inflation.",
        "In sum, inflation edged down but still remains high.",
        "Despite the disinflationary impact of recent cost developments and a likely partial correction in food prices, the high inflation remains a risk to the pricing behavior.",
        "Recently released data indicate an ongoing recovery in the economic activity.",

        "Survey indicators of June show that this outlook will be maintained.",
        "Not only the manufacturing industry, but also services, retail trade and construction saw strengthening activity recently.",

        "The uptick in the labor market, which started in February and March, grew more apparent in April period.",
        "Supported by rising employment in non-farm sectors, unemployment rate records a decline.",
        "Leading indicators hint at a further decrease in unemployment rate amid the economic recovery.",
        "Despite the current favorable outlook in global economic activity, downside risks to global economy reside as well.",
        "In particular, should the normalization process of the Fed’s policy-rate increase and the balance sheet downsizing prove faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may reverse.",
        "That may generate fluctuations in prices of securities in advanced economies and weaken the growth trend.",
        "Moreover, fading risk appetite may cause fluctuations in portfolio flows to emerging economies as well.",
        "In addition to these, the course of Brexit talks and effects of the blurred global economic policies like foreign trade protectionism that is on the agenda of many countries, particularly the US, are monitored closely.",
        "Recently-released indicators confirm the previous view that downside risks to economic activity have abated and the economic recovery will prove more robust as of the second quarter of the year.",
        "Signals for a wider sectoral spillover of the pickup in economic activity led by exporting sectors compared to the previous periods are important to a stable recovery in growth.",
        "The gradual improvement in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the positive effect of the cumulative depreciation on net exports and the normalization of commercial relations with Russia support growth.",
        "Moreover, the measures and incentive packages to boost consumption and investment expenditures, reduced uncertainty and improved financial conditions will continue to spur growth.",
        "The improvement in employment and the fall in unemployment rate on the back of the ongoing recovery constitute a ground for the maintenance of this trend and increased contribution of domestic demand to growth.",
        "Investment is envisaged to exhibit a gradual improvement as uncertainties wane and the climate of confidence grows stronger.",
        "On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute a downside risk to growth also in 2017, as they have recently.",
        "The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the July Inflation Report in the meeting.",
        "Accordingly, year-end inflation forecast was revised upwards by 0.2 points for 2017, while it was kept unchanged for 2018 compared to the 2017 April Inflation Report.",
        "Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target.",

        "Food inflation remained on the rise while energy inflation continued to slow.",
        "The lagged effects of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation continued to weigh upon core goods whereas annual core goods inflation declined due to the methodology change to clothing prices.",
        "Adjusted for these transient effects, the improvement in underlying inflation remained limited in this period.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.28 points to 16.91 percent in May largely due to the annual fresh fruits and vegetables inflation that hit 48 percent.",

        "Leading indicators for June signal that annual food inflation will decrease on the back of the base effect from unprocessed food.",

        "Factors affecting services inflation included cost increases driven by exchange rates and food prices and indexation to headline inflation.",
        "Annual core goods inflation dropped by 0.31 points to 9.71 percent in May, mainly due to the temporary impact of the methodology change to weight system of the clothing category.",
        "In non-clothing categories, annual inflation continued to climb because of the lagged spillovers of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation.",
        "More specifically, prices soared at a much faster rate than historical averages across core goods excluding clothing and durables.",
        "All in all, inflation remains high.",
        "Despite recent cost developments and the expected partial improvement in food prices, risks to the pricing behavior still prevail.",

        "Moreover, temporary tax reductions in white goods and furniture sectors to be taken back in October accompanied by the effects of the methodological changes in the clothing group are also noted as the developments envisaged to cause fluctuations in inflation in the short term.",
        "Additionally, the Committee evaluated that as the improvement in economic activity gets stronger, demand conditions will offer less support to the disinflation process.",
        "In short, although recent improvements in cost factors and expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks to the pricing behavior.",

        "The main driver of annual and quarterly growth proved to be domestic demand led by machinery-equipment investments and private consumption in the third quarter.",

        "On the other hand, current indicators show that the third-quarter improvement in machinery-equipment investments continues.",
        "The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The rise in exports of goods slows the deterioration in the current account deficit and improves the core current account deficit indicators.",

        "As the steps towards normalization have been in line with expectations, the market reaction is currently mild.",
        "However, risks to the US interest rates are on the upside.",

        "The third quarter’s economic activity and aggregate demand were mostly in line with predictions.",
        "In the fourth quarter, domestic demand might see some slowdown due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the withdrawal of tax incentives for durable goods, and economic growth is expected to move towards its underlying trend.",

        "Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.",
        "In this regard, the contractionary pressure of the recent Turkish lira depreciation on domestic demand might be partly offset by the export channel.",
        "The rise in commodity prices, particularly for oil and metals, and exchange rate changes have recently driven inflation higher through the cost channel.",
        "Amid robust economic activity, cost pressures had a much larger effect on inflation.",
        "Consumer inflation is expected to come down markedly due to base effects but remain high in December.",
        "The current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior.",
        "These risks and the high levels of inflation expectations might dampen the expected improvement in the inflation outlook from December through the first months of 2018.",

        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",

        "In June, consumer prices remained almost unchanged with a minimal rise of 0.03% and annual inflation decreased by 2.99 points to 15.72%.",
        "In this period, annual inflation decreased across all subgroups, chiefly in the food group.",
        "Annual food inflation declined on the back of the falling unprocessed food prices in tandem with the prospects for the vegetable products.",
        "Energy prices decreased, contributing positively to consumer inflation.",
        "Domestic demand developments and the effects of monetary tightening as well as the waning impacts of the cumulative depreciation supported the deceleration in annual inflation of core inflation indicators.",
        "In the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, annual inflation fell by 9.24 points to 19.20% in June.",
        "Annual unprocessed food inflation declined to 15.31% due to vegetable prices and became the main driver of the slowdown in consumer inflation.",
        "Processed food prices, on the other hand, posted a significant month-on-month increase also in June in response to the lagged effects of increases in costs on prices and annual inflation increased in this group.",
        "In June, energy prices decreased by 1.04% due to the fall in municipal water tariffs and exchange rate developments, as well as fuel prices which declined amid falling oil prices.",
        "In July, annual energy inflation is expected to rise depending on the adjustment in electricity prices.",
        "Recently-released data indicate a moderate recovery in the economic activity.",
        "Industrial production recorded a month-on-month increase in May, and maintained the trend of recovery in the April-May period with an uptick by 1.7%.",
        "This outlook is preserved even when other transport vehicles that stimulate industrial production are excluded.",
        "The unfavorable outlook in the survey data of April-May was replaced by recovery in June.",
        "Thus, survey indicators such as the manufacturing industry capacity utilization ratio and the PMI-production recorded an increase in the second quarter.",
        "On the other hand, the services sector also exhibits improvements, while the construction sector still remains sluggish.",
        "Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, due to improved competitiveness.",
        "In particular, strong tourism sector supports economic activity through direct and indirect channels.",
        "Despite recent signs of a partial global slowdown, particularly for the European Union (EU), external demand maintains its relative strength.",
        "Notwithstanding the somewhat slowing exports to the EU in April-May, the seasonally-adjusted non-gold export quantity index continued to rise quarter-on-quarter amid strong exports to other regions.",
        "In the same period, the number of foreign visitors and travel and transport revenues remained on a firm uptrend while exports of services continued to boost growth.",
        "Economy-wide spillovers from the robust tourism industry through sectors such as nondurable goods production, clothing in particular, and transport services help offset part of the weak domestic demand caused by the dim labor and credit markets outlook.",
        "The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance.",
        "Firms’ orientation towards external markets due to subdued domestic demand, and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; the lagged effects of exchange rates and the modest outlook for loans and economic activity restrain import demand, and external balance continues to improve at an accelerated pace thanks to the upbeat in tourism activity.",
        "Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.",
        "Labor market data is relatively weak.",
        "According to April 2019 data, nonfarm employment remains flat while nonfarm unemployment rate came to a halt.",
        "Across sectors, industrial employment increased while services employment edged down and construction lost more jobs, compared to the previous period.",
        "In sum, looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the partial improvement in financial conditions.",
        "Against this background, aggregate demand conditions are estimated to make a further contribution to disinflation.",
        "Besides geopolitical developments, ongoing uncertainties over global economic activity pose a downside risk to growth via capital flows and foreign trade channels.",
        "The persistent trade tension between the US and China, political uncertainties regarding the Brexit, and Middle East-based geopolitical developments cause the uncertainty over global economic policies to remain elevated and the vulnerabilities in global financial markets to continue.",
        "All these factors keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.",
        "The downside risks to future crude oil prices have intensified.",
        "Despite OPEC’s decision in July to extend the production cuts, ongoing geopolitical problems across the world, and the slowing US shale oil production, the downside risks to crude oil prices have strengthened due to the high level of uncertainty over global trade and the unfavorable global economic outlook.",
        "In addition, in spite of higher wages due to tight job markets in advanced economies, inflation remains moderate.",
        "All in all, the global economic outlook appears to have fed into the downside risks to global inflation.",
        "Recently, weaker global economic activity and heightened downside risks to inflation have strengthened the possibility of advanced economy central banks to take expansionary monetary policy steps.",
        "These developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, increasing the upward risks on portfolio flows to emerging markets.",
        "On the other hand, rising protectionism and the uncertainty regarding global economic policies pose downside risks to these portfolio flows.",
        "These factors are closely monitored in terms of their potential impacts on domestic economic activity and financial markets through both capital flows and international trade.",
        "In the second quarter of the year, Turkey’s risk premium negatively diverged from other emerging market economies due to domestic uncertainties and geopolitical factors.",
        "However, it has rapidly declined since mid-June owing to reduced uncertainties, the improvement in the outlook for global financial conditions as well as in macroeconomic indicators, and the tight monetary policy stance, while the volatility in financial markets has decreased.",
        "On the other hand, the persistence of high levels of country risk premium and exchange rate volatility as well as the lingering global uncertainties and geopolitical risks keep the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook alive.",
        "In the second quarter of 2019, banks’ domestic funding conditions tightened, causing them to reflect the increased Turkish lira funding costs in loan rates.",
        "Due to these developments and the expectations for the overall economic outlook, loan growth rates lost pace in this period.",
        "A decrease in the degree of monetary policy tightness and the introduction of accommodative credit packages are deemed to be the factors that will support the normalization in credit conditions and credit demand in the upcoming period.",
        "The speed, scope and sustainability of the normalization in credit conditions will be important for the economic activity outlook.",
        "Despite the restrictive impact of domestic demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook in the upcoming period.",
        "Anchoring inflation and exchange rate expectations is crucial for the effectiveness of monetary policy in the current period.",
        "The course of food prices constitutes one of the risk factors that may affect the short-term inflation outlook.",
        "While accumulated cost pressures keep the upside risks to processed food prices alive, they may also exert an additional pressure on catering services prices through periodic factors.",
        "On the other hand, projections for unprocessed food inflation may be revised downwards depending on the future course of the correction in this group’s inflation driven by the increased supply of vegetables due to favorable weather conditions.",
        "Against this background, the risks that the course of food prices may pose to the short-term inflation outlook are considered to be balanced.",
        "The inflation outlook continued to improve.",
        "In the second quarter, inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution from a deceleration in unprocessed food and energy prices.",
        "Domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy continue to support disinflation.",
        "Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook.",
        "In light of these developments, recent end-year inflation forecasts are slightly below the projections of the April Inflation Report.",
        "Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 425 basis points.",
        "The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower country risk premium, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.",
        "Keeping the disinflation process on track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance.",
        "In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.",
        "The Committee maintains its assessment that the recent gradual improvement in the country risk premium will also continue in the upcoming period.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price and financial stability objectives, taking into account all macroeconomic indicators including inflation and economic activity in particular.",
        "In order to support the effectiveness of monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.",
        "The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior.",
        "If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.",
        "Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability.",
        "Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.",

        "In this period, annual inflation increased in food and energy groups while it decreased in the core goods group.",
        "The rise in annual food inflation was driven by the significant hike in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "Energy prices rose mainly due to international oil prices and exchange rate developments.",
        "While services inflation followed an almost flat course, the slowdown in core goods inflation continued across all subgroups.",
        "Against this background, core inflation indicators suggested a continued deceleration in annual inflation, and the underlying trend of core indicators remained low.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.52 points in March to 29.77%.",
        "Unprocessed food prices, led by fresh fruit and vegetable prices, had a decisive role in this development.",
        "The processed food group posted moderate price increases while annual inflation in this group declined.",
        "Energy prices were up by 1.94% and annual energy inflation rose by 1.84 points to 16.41%.",
        "This rise is mainly attributed to the rising fuel and bottled gas prices in tandem with exchange rates and the outlook for international oil prices.",
        "In March, annual core goods inflation dropped by 1.30 points to 19.92%.",
        "In this period, annual inflation decreased across all subgroups.",
        "The decline in durable goods prices was mainly driven by the fall in automobile prices while the new season price hikes in the clothing group remained below those of the previous year.",
        "Annual inflation in other core goods lost pace but still remained high.",
        "To sum up, the moderate course of core goods inflation is attributed to weak domestic demand.",
        "Services inflation rose month-on-month by 0.07 points to 15.21%.",
        "Annual inflation slightly decreased in restaurants-hotels, rents, and transportation services whereas it increased in the other services subgroup.",
        "The decline in annual inflation in transportations services was led by local passenger transportation.",
        "Meanwhile, the increase in prices of maintenance-repair services as well as in prices of education services driven by private school fees constituted the most significant factor affecting other services inflation.",
        "Despite the slow course of domestic demand, services inflation remained elevated due to the cost factors as well as the backward-indexation behavior.",
        "In the final quarter of 2018, GDP decreased by 3.0% on an annual basis and by 2.4% on a quarterly basis.",
        "Thus, growth in 2018 was 2.6%.",
        "While the contraction in economic activity in the final quarter of 2018 was driven by domestic demand conditions, net exports continued to underpin growth and the rebalancing trend in the Turkish economy became more apparent.",
        "Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy continues.",
        "Economic activity displays a slow pace due to tight financial conditions.",
        "The rise in public expenditures, extended tax cuts on durable goods and the partial rebound in loan volume underpinned a moderate recovery in domestic demand in the first quarter.",
        "Accordingly, while a partial recovery is observed in economic activity compared to the previous quarter, the contribution of aggregate demand conditions to disinflation continues.",
        "The recent rise in financial volatility and risk premium indicators increases the downside risks to the domestic demand outlook.",
        "Despite recent signs of a global slowdown, particularly for the EU, external demand remains relatively strong.",
        "Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; lagged exchange rate effects, subdued loans and economic activity dampen import demand; and external balance continues to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand.",
        "Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend in the upcoming period.",
        "Labor market data confirm the slowdown in economic activity.",
        "The data for January 2019 suggest that nonfarm employment was down across all sectors compared to the previous period, construction in particular; while unemployment remained on the rise.",
        "Economic activity has lost further momentum across the world, particularly in the EU, since the previous MPC meeting.",
        "The ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the EU, the current trade conflict between the US and China and geopolitical tensions have led to higher uncertainty over global economic policies and persistently fragile financial markets, which feeds into the downside risks to global economic activity.",
        "Supply-side effects may pose upside risks to prices for international crude oil and other commodities in the upcoming period.",
        "If such risks materialize, the monetary policy response will ensure to keep the possible deterioration in inflation expectations and the pricing behavior under control.",
        "The improvement in the risk appetite due to the postponed normalization of monetary policy across advanced economies has provided a partial boost for portfolio flows to emerging economies.",
        "Developments in domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in inflation indicators.",
        "However, higher food and import prices and the elevated course of inflation expectations point to continued risks to price stability.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, and kept the one-week repo auction rate, i.e.",
        "the policy rate, unchanged at 24%.",

        "The largest contribution to the decline in inflation came from energy and core goods groups.",
        "Oil prices and exchange rate developments favorably affected the energy group, while core goods prices were affected by both exchange rate developments and weaker domestic demand.",
        "Services inflation decreased across all subcategories.",
        "Against this background, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend in core indicators decelerated.",
        "In sum, consumer prices in December reflect the appreciation in the Turkish lira as well as demand-side effects led by weaker economic activity.",

        "Although monthly price increases in other core goods significantly lost pace, annual inflation in this group remained high.",

        "Increased protectionist trends in international trade continue to keep the risks to the global growth outlook alive by increasing uncertainties regarding global economic policies.",
        "The global economic slowdown has been slightly more pronounced since the previous MPC meeting.",
        "Therefore, the outlook for 2019 has been revised down for both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "The buoyant labor markets across advanced economies sustain the wages-backed upside risks to global inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, given the weaker global growth otlook and the fall in oil prices, the global inflation pressures are judged to be mild in the upcoming period.",

        "Expectations on the normalization of monetary policy stances in advanced economies have moderated since the last MPC meeting.",

        "In November, consumer prices increased by 0.38% while annual inflation rose by 2.01 points to 10.56%.",

        "In this period, annual inflation increased in core goods, food, and energy groups while it remained relatively flat in the services group.",
        "Although annual inflation in core indicators was up due to the base effect, the B and C indices maintained their mild trend thanks to the stable course of the Turkish lira, the improvement in inflation expectations, and the developments in domestic demand conditions and producer prices.",
        "Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 1.04 points to 8.89% in November.",
        "This rise was primarily driven by the unprocessed food group.",

        "In November, energy prices were up by 0.55% while annual energy inflation increased by 1.34 points to 7.34%.",

        "Annual core goods inflation surged by 4.65 points to 6.57% in this period due to the effect of the durable goods group in particular.",
        "Although durable goods prices remained flat in November on the back of both the stable outlook in the Turkish lira and the moderate course of domestic demand conditions, annual inflation in this group posted a significant increase due to the low base effect stemming from the temporary tax cuts in the same period of the previous year.",
        "While annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group remained almost flat at a low level, it slightly receded in the other core goods group.",
        "The stable course of the Turkish lira and the current trend in producer prices favorably affect the short-term inflation outlook in the core goods group.",

        "In this period, despite the curbing effects driven by domestic demand and Turkish lira, services inflation remained elevated due to the backward-indexation behavior, real unit labor costs, and the lagged price hikes in the sub-items of administered transport services.",
        "6.The improvement in inflation expectations continues.",

        "Due to the robust increase in machinery-equipment investments, the downtrend in total investments came to a halt.",
        "Although the uptrend in exports of goods and services remained intact, the contribution of net exports to annual and quarterly growth was negative due to the rebound in imports.",
        "As risk premium, exchange rate volatility and uncertainties have declined, improved financial conditions and accelerated loans have supported domestic demand in the last quarter of the year.",
        "Despite the weakness in the labor market, private consumption has been increasing on the back of postponed demand.",

        "While flexibility in market diversification and strong course in tourism support exports of goods and services, the recovery in domestic demand stimulates imports.",
        "Against this background, in the last quarter of the year, it is expected that the contribution of net exports to economic growth will decline, and the current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, will maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures.",
        "Labor market data is relatively weak.",
        "Despite the rise in nonfarm employment in the third quarter, nonfarm unemployment rate continued to rise.",

        "Leading indicators signal for a partial recovery in the labor market in the last quarter of the year.",

        "Global economic activity continued to slow down in the third quarter of the year.",
        "Leading indicators for the next quarter indicate that the ongoing global slowdown in the manufacturing industry might have also fed into the services sector.",
        "These developments keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.",
        "The resulting likely effects on domestic growth are monitored closely.",
        "Weak global economic activity depresses commodity prices and leads to a mild course in crude oil prices despite supply-side hurdles arising from geopolitical developments.",
        "Accordingly, global inflation rates remain flat.",
        "Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies.",
        "The expectation that recently adopted accommodative stance of monetary policies in advanced economies, the US in particular, is likely to be maintained over a medium term horizon under current circumstances, and its implications for global financial conditions support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite.",
        "Accordingly, amid recent positive expectations regarding a likely settlement of the trade tension between the US and China, global risk appetite has increased slightly compared to the previous meeting period and portfolio flows towards emerging economies have presented a more favorable outlook.",
        "Meanwhile, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.",
        "Turkey’s risk premium continued to decline owing to a cautious monetary policy stance and improved macroeconomic indicators as well as the accommodative monetary policy outlook in advanced economies.",
        "The decline in the short-term exchange rate volatility has also become more pronounced following the previous meeting period.",
        "However, possible upside effects of global and geopolitical uncertainties on the medium-term inflation outlook through country risk premium and exchange rate volatility channels will continue to be monitored closely.",
        "The strong rate cuts since July and expectations of further rate cuts thereafter helped bring loan and deposit rates further down.",
        "Thus, TL-denominated commercial and consumer loan rates dropped significantly due also to the improvement in inflation expectations, while improved financing conditions and growing domestic demand helped total loans, consumer loans in particular, accelerate.",
        "Consumer loans have seen an upswing since early August while corporate loan growth gained pace with a lag.",
        "This can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as postponed loan demand.",
        "The more flexible and effective use of required reserves as a countercyclical macroprudential tool in this period supports credit growth and financial stability.",
        "In this context, firstly on , Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios and the remuneration rate on Turkish lira denominated required reserves were linked to annual growth rates of Turkish lira cash credits.",
        "Moreover, on , considering the level of rebalancing in the economy, a new reserve requirement practice was introduced to channel credit supply towards production-oriented sectors rather than consumption.",

        "The sliding scale system continued to curb annual inflation in the energy group, meanwhile, fuel prices slightly increased in August mainly due to the rise in LPG prices for which the SCT was formerly reduced to zero.",
        "Bottled gas prices increased in tandem with the rise in LPG prices.",
        "In addition to the uptrend in electricity market clearing prices due to weather conditions, international natural gas and coal prices are on the rise as well.",

        "While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation will prove to be mostly temporary with the normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints, and waning base effects.",
        "Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.",
        "In this MPC Meeting period, equity and bond markets of emerging economies have attracted portfolio inflows to a limited extent.",
        "The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.",

        "According to main industrial groups, the increases in energy and intermediate goods groups stood out in August.",
        "Agricultural drought that has become evident in some regions leads to a change in the composition of electricity production, having an upward effect on industrial electricity costs.",

        "In July, the industrial production index decreased by 4.2% month-on-month and by 2.3% year-on-year.",
        "The sector-wide decrease of production in this period is attributed to the loss of working days (bridging day effect) driven by the bridging the official holiday of 15 July (Thursday) with the Feast of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) holiday (17-25 July), which was extended to 9 days.",
        "Excluding this effect, the underlying trend of industrial production remained strong.",

        "High–frequency data indicate a rapid recovery in the services items most affected by the pandemic due to increased mobility in the third quarter.",
        "In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered higher rates of increases.",
        "The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.",
        "While employment continued to grow in July led by the services sector, the total and non-farm unemployment rates increased by 1.4 points and 1.6 points month-on-month to 12.0% and 13.9%, respectively, due to the rise in the labor force participation rate.",

        "The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective.",
        "The Committee once again underlined its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance for the sustainability of recovery in economic activity and financial stability.",
        "The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target.",
        "Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments, inflation expectations, as well as the temporary factors projected to bear effect on these in the short term, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.",
        "Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening.",
        "It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors.",
        "On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed.",
        "The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans.",
        "While the nominal commercial loan growth remains well below previous year averages, the strong course in personal loans has largely remained in place.",
        "In addition, the macroprudential policy framework has been strengthened to curb personal loan growth.",
        "Accordingly, the impact of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency’s related decisions will be monitored.",

        "Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are closely monitored for macroeconomic stability.",
        "The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks.",
        "Accordingly it is judged that a revision in monetary policy stance is needed and the policy rate was decided to be reduced by 100 basis points.",
        "Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices and administered prices in the lead.",
        "However, sufficiently tight monetary stance to ensure the return of inflation to its downward trend once temporary effects disappear, will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and financial market developments.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.",
        "Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in the country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs.",
        "This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.",
        "Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices.",
        "The outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and the global risk appetite heighten the risks to the portfolio flows towards emerging economies.",
        "In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.",
        "The Committee reiterated that in order to achieve price stability, strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.",
        "The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.",
        "Consumer prices rose by 1.80% in July, and annual inflation increased by 1.42 points to 18.95%.",
        "While this development was mainly driven by the rise in food and energy groups, annual inflation increased moderately in services and decreased slightly in core goods.",
        "In July, the Turkish lira followed a mild course while international energy prices rose, and non-energy commodity markets continued to register decreases, albeit to a limited extent.",
        "Nonetheless, producer inflation remained on the rise due to lagged effects and the ongoing disruptions in supply chains.",
        "Against this background, annual inflation increased in the B index but decreased in the C index, while the recent trends of these core indicators remained high.",
        "In July, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 2.77%, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 4.93 points to 24.92%.",
        "In addition to the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, cumulative exchange rate effects, and weather conditions, supply constraints for certain products affected food producer inflation adversely, and these increases spilled over into consumer prices with the reopening.",
        "Annual inflation rose by 7.03 points to 25.73% in the unprocessed food group, and by 2.93 points to 24.13% in the processed food group.",
        "Seasonally adjusted data in the unprocessed food group pointed to a significant monthly increase in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, with fruits in the lead.",
        "While milk prices rose due to the regulation in raw milk reference prices, there were also increases in prices of some pulses whose domestic production decreased due to weather conditions.",
        "In the processed food group, the subcategories that diverged negatively were bread and cereals, cheese and other dairy products, and processed meat products.",
        "Another significant subcategory in this period was fats and oils due to external price pressures.",
        "Energy prices surged by 6.19% in July while the group’s annual inflation rose by 4.23 points to 21.51%.",
        "Electricity and natural gas prices increased by 15.01% and 9.84%, respectively, becoming the main drivers of the price dynamics in the energy group.",
        "While part of the required price increase in LPG was met through the sliding scale system, part of it was reflected in prices.",
        "Bottled gas prices also rose in parallel to the increase in LPG prices.",
        "Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.70 points to 21.22% in July.",
        "The Turkish lira followed a relatively mild course in this period, which alleviated pressures driven by import prices.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in durable consumption goods, but increased in other subcategories.",
        "In July, prices of durable goods edged down by 0.11%, while annual inflation thereof registered a decline by 3.68 points to 27.18%.",
        "These figures were led mainly by the fall in furniture prices as well as the base effect despite the ongoing monthly increases in electrical and non-electrical appliances, with white goods in the lead.",
        "Meanwhile, the clothing and footwear group, which followed a moderate course amid restrictions, maintained the uptrend stimulated by the reopening, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 1.51 points to 8.37%.",
        "Reacting more sluggishly to developments in the exchange rate and import prices compared to durable goods, other core goods registered a further increase in annual inflation.",
        "In July, services prices increased by 1.32%, while annual group inflation edged up by 0.29 points to 13.75%.",
        "Annual inflation rose in restaurants-hotels and transport services, remained flat in rent, and declined in communication and other services.",
        "Amid normalization steps, prices increased in the eat-out meals and accommodation services in the restaurants-hotels group in July as well.",
        "The negative outlook in catering services is attributable also to the high food inflation.",
        "In this period, prices remained relatively flat in transport services, yet annual inflation in this group increased due to the low base.",
        "Against this background, prices of services excluding restaurants-hotels recorded a relatively mild course in July.",
        "In July, annual inflation in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group decreased slightly as the increase in the PPI of the last six months was not reflected to lump-sum and minimum lump-sum taxes.",
        "The August results of the Survey of Market Participants indicated that the current year-end inflation expectation was revised upwards and the 12-month ahead inflation expectation downwards.",
        "Accordingly, while the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.66 points to 16.30%, the 12-month ahead inflation expectation fell by 0.14 points to 12.48%.",
        "Currently, the 24-month ahead inflation expectation is 10.52%.",
        "Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that with the normalization steps taken, the services sector, which was affected more by pandemic restrictions, has been accompanying the ongoing recovery in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions.",
        "On the other hand, some virus variants recently leading to a resurgence of cases keep the downside risks to the global economic activity posed by the uncertainties about the course of the pandemic in place.",
        "Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally.",
        "Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices.",
        "The effects of rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.",
        "Since the previous MPC Meeting, monthly and annual inflation rates in some developed economies have increased further.",
        "The normalization process in emerging economies has continued and some central banks have delivered additional tightening.",
        "This outlook points to increased uncertainties and a slight tightening in global financial conditions.",
        "The fluctuating course of global risk appetite and uncertainties regarding the course of long-term bond rates lead to volatility in global financial markets.",
        "The Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures increase data sensitivity in monetary policies and global financial markets in turn, which may lead to volatilities.",
        "In this MPC Meeting period, portfolio outflows from emerging economies have stemmed from equity markets, while bond markets have attracted inflows to a limited extent.",
        "The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.",
        "Producer inflation continued to rise in July due to the lagged effects of international commodity prices, the lingering problems in supply chains, and the adjustments made to domestic energy prices.",
        "In this period, producer prices increased in energy, wood and cork products, the base metal sector, which is one of the sectors providing input to the manufacturing industry, and the construction sector-related non-metallic mineral products.",

        "Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are closely monitored for macroeconomic stability.",
        "Domestic economic activity remained strong in the second quarter.",
        "In June, the industrial production index increased by 2.3% month-on-month and 23.7% year-on-year.",
        "Thus, up 1.6% from the first quarter, production remained strong in the second quarter.",
        "Indices for turnover and retail sales volume also recorded a sharp increase in June due to the reopening.",

        "After the reopening, confidence indices registered increases across all sectors in June and July, particularly in services.",
        "The acceleration of the domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.",
        "In June, total and non-farm unemployment rates were down 2.5 and 2.7 points from May to 10.6% and 12.3%, respectively, thanks to the overall growth of non-farm employment and reduced labor force participation.",
        "High-frequency data point to a reopening-induced recovery in the labor market.",
        "In this respect, it is assessed that there may be employment increases in the services sector in the upcoming period.",

        "In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook.",
        "The increase in inflation in July was driven by the rise in food inflation, due to supply-side effects in some products led by climate conditions, the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, as well as the effects of the reopening.",
        "On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed.",

        "Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices.",
        "While the current tight monetary policy keeps demand-side factors under control by containing loans and domestic demand, it also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",

        "Annual inflation increased in rents, restaurants-hotels and communication groups, while posting a more significant rise in the transport group, and decreased in other services.",
        "The rise in transport services was mainly driven by the adjustments in intra-city transportation fees.",
        "The rise in annual inflation in restaurants-hotels was mainly driven by catering services, and the increases in food prices and the minimum wage were influential in this development.",
        "Excluding communication, the trend of the services inflation remained high.",
        "The Committee has reiterated that pandemic-led dynamics have contained the services inflation, particularly inflation in accommodation, package tours, education, transport, recreational and cultural services, and underlined the upside risks associated with the normalization process.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that the special communication tax, which was raised from 7.5% to 10%, had an upside effect on services inflation, as confirmed by leading indicators.",
        "Inflation expectations decreased in January and also in February, however remained at elevated levels.",
        "In CBRT Survey of Expectations the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased by 0.17 points to 10.36% and 24 month-ahead inflation expectation decreased by 0.11 points to 9.03%.",
        "The Committee evaluated the impact of the change in the weights in consumer prices index on the forecast path presented in the January Inflation Report.",
        "It was noted that the rise in the weights of groups with high annual inflation would make an upside impact on annual inflation until mid-2021.",
        "The impact of the weight on annual inflation was projected to reach 0.5 points by April, then post a gradual decline in the rest of the year and die out towards the end of the year.",
        "Global economic activity data indicate that the partial recovery since the third quarter continues, albeit with some deceleration.",
        "However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the vaccination process and the course of the pandemic.",
        "The effects of pandemic-related restrictions in European countries are more prevalent on the services sector, while manufacturing industry remains strong.",
        "Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances.",
        "Despite the recent rise, long-term interest rates in advanced economies are still at historically low levels.",
        "Even though central banks announce in their statements that inflation is likely to increase temporarily in the post-pandemic normalization process, the forward guidance delivered and market expectations point that the low interest environment would continue for an extended period in advanced economies.",
        "The effectiveness of these policies on financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and the available policy room in each country.",
        "Similar to the previous MPC meeting period, emerging economy portfolio markets continued to attract large volume of inflows due to improved risk sentiment.",
        "In this period, the trend of inflows to bond markets of emerging economies remained the same as the previous MPC meeting, while inflows to equity markets continued increasingly.",
        "Crude oil prices have been rapidly increasing since the last MPC meeting.",
        "In addition, the ongoing rise in commodity prices excluding energy, specifically agricultural commodities and industrial metals, have an adverse effect on both producer and consumer inflation.",
        "Inflation is quite high in paper products and basic metals sectors, which are main input providers for the manufacturing industry.",
        "Supply constraints have become more pronounced as delivery times lengthened in those and related sectors.",
        "Other items driving producer inflation higher include vegetable oils, animal feed, processed steel products, vehicles and electronic products.",
        "These items affect consumer inflation through food and durable goods.",
        "The Committee stated that in the upcoming months, consumer inflation would increase consistent with the past projections due to the base effect of import prices and the rise would be mainly driven by the energy group.",
        "The Committee noted the important role of commodity prices in continuing inflationary pressures despite the appreciation in the Turkish lira, and reiterated the upside risks for the upcoming months.",
        "Economic activity is on a strong course.",
        "In December, the industrial production index increased by 1.3% month-on-month and 12.1% year-on-year.",
        "Thus, production gained strength, having grown by 4.8% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.",
        "While turnover and retail trade volume indices also strengthened compared to the third quarter, economic activity was considerably buoyant in services excluding tourism-related sectors as well as in trade.",
        "Hence, pre-pandemic levels were exceeded widely across sectors excluding industrial and services sector groups that were adversely affected by the pandemic.",
        "The strong course of economic activity is also reflected onto the labor market..",
        "In November period, seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment increased by 0.2% from the previous period, while total and nonfarm unemployment rates were 12.9% and 14.9%, respectively.",
        "During this period, employment was up in the industrial sector amid supported by upward trend in exports, but edged down in construction and services.",
        "The fall in services employment was driven by the sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.",
        "While the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy have been limited, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail.",
        "Survey indicators for February indicated that manufacturing industry activity remains strong, particularly in intermediate and durable goods sectors.",
        "While there is no additional slowdown in domestic demand, there is some weakening in external demand mainly due to lockdown restrictions in Europe.",
        "Domestic demand faces upside risks associated with the timing of lifting pandemic-related restrictions.",
        "The Committee assessed that the inflationary effects of the sectoral divergences that emerged due to pandemic dynamics and the macro policy mix, along with the risks they imply for the period ahead should be monitored.",
        "Evaluating the output gap indicators related to the cyclical state of the economy, the Committee concluded that economic activity started converging to its underlying trend due to some slowdown in the first quarter, but demand-side inflationary effects continue to exist throughout the quarter.",
        "Business and household surveys indicate that the demand for durable goods has been strong.",
        "Some members of the Committee underlined that personal loan demand is still brisk due to high inflation expectations, and reiterated that the effects of the monetary policy tightening are yet to be felt.",
        "To this end, developments in credit growth and its composition will be monitored closely.",
        "The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance.",
        "In addition, rising international prices for oil and other commodities also affect the external balance.",
        "Gold imports have declined to their historical averages since mid-January.",
        "The Committee assessed that terms of trade-related risks to the current account balance may be limited if that trend in gold imports hints at a permanent improvement.",
        "Credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions.",
        "The limiting effect of the slowdown in loans on domestic demand and imports is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period.",
        "The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.",
        "The Committee re-emphasized that monetary policy decisions will be taken within the framework of inflation targeting regime and with the priority of price stability.",
        "The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving price stability target.",
        "Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely.",
        "The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing upward trend in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.",
        "Accordingly, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability.",
        "In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations are monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon.",
        "The interaction of risks posed by soaring commodity prices to the inflation outlook with the pricing behavior and inflation expectations will be closely monitored.",
        "In addition, there has been recently an acceleration in consumer loans.",
        "Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.",
        "The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5% target are reached.",
        "Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.",
        "The effects of the monetary policy stance on money markets have been examined.",
        "There has been some decline in loan and deposit rates, recently.",
        "The Committee stated that Turkish lira reserve requirements need to be increased in order to enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "For the same purpose, the Committee discussed whether to lower the rates within the Reserve Options Mechanism, which allows a certain ratio of Turkish lira required reserves to be maintained in foreign currency and gold.",
        "The Committee emphasized that the policy rate is the sole instrument to determine the monetary policy stance, while the required reserve ratio is a tool that affects the transmission of the monetary stance determined by the policy rate to deposit, loan and other money markets.",
        "The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.",
        "In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors.",
        "It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.",
        "Consumer prices rose by 0.89% in May, while annual inflation decreased by 0.55 points to 16.59%.",
        "Annual inflation receded in energy and core goods; remained relatively flat in the food group and increased in services.",
        "In this period, lockdown measures led to interruptions in economic activity in certain sectors, which recorded only limited price increases, in turn.",
        "Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of B and C indices registered some decline, maintaining their high levels.",
        "In May, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.29% and the group’s annual inflation crept up by 0.06 points to 17.04%.",
        "Annual inflation edged down by 0.06 points to 14.61% in the unprocessed food group, but rose by 0.13 points to 19.49% in the processed food group.",
        "Annual inflation receded in fresh fruits and vegetables within the unprocessed food group, whereas it increased in the other unprocessed food group due to the hike in red meat prices.",
        "Meanwhile, processed food prices registered a monthly increase of 0.87%.",
        "Prices in the bread and cereals group rose by 1.00%, while non-alcoholic beverages stood out among other processed food.",
        "Moreover, increase in raw milk reference prices became another factor to keep risks to food inflation brisk.",
        "The uptrend in international food and agricultural commodity prices accelerated in May, and price hikes spread across all subcategories, with cereals and fats and oils in the lead.",
        "Energy prices rose by 1.50% in May, while the group’s annual inflation declined by 0.73% to 17.71%.",
        "This is attributed to fuel prices that increased by 3.84% due to the uptick in international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments accompanied by adjustments in the sliding-scale system and termination of the price cap practice.",
        "It is considered that fuel prices will increase also in June amid the carry-over effects of the SCT rise in May, yet the high base effect will cause annual energy inflation to decline further.",
        "It should be emphasized that despite the recent adjustments, the sliding-scale practice continues to limit price increases both directly and indirectly.",
        "Prices of core goods rose by 0.86% in May and annual core goods inflation decreased by 2.29% to 20.84%.",
        "Annual inflation decreased across all subcategories, particularly in clothing and footwear.",
        "The recent trend of upsurge in the clothing and footwear group lost sizeable momentum due to lockdown effects, and annual inflation declined by 5.40 points to 5.56%.",
        "In durable goods, prices increased by 0.91%, while annual inflation decreased by 1.76 points, yet remained high at 30.74%.",
        "In addition to international commodity prices, exchange rate effects were visible in automobile and furniture items, while the mild course in electrical and non-electrical appliances limited the inflation.",
        "In May, services prices increased by 1.18%, and annual services inflation rose by 0.50 points to 13.62%.",
        "Annual inflation surged in transport services; rose by a more limited rate in restaurants-hotels, communication and rent; and declined somewhat in other services.",
        "The surge in annual transport services inflation is attributed also to the increases in intercity bus fares due to capacity constraints led by pandemic measures.",
        "Price increases in the restaurants-hotels group remained quite moderate due to lockdown, while annual inflation maintained its uptrend owing to the low base.",
        "Inflation expectations of market participants increased in June.",
        "While the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.65 points to 14.46%, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations increased by 0.31 points and 0.17 points to 12.12% and 10.16%, respectively.",
        "The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery.",
        "Accelerated activity in the manufacturing industry and global trade as well as improvements in services bolster this recovery process.",
        "Pandemic-led downside risks to the global economic performance are reduced amid ongoing vaccination efforts.",
        "The increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally.",
        "The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.",
        "Since the previous MPC Meeting, the expectations of policy rate hike have been brought forward in tandem with the median expectations of the FOMC members, while inflation projections have also increased.",
        "The normalization process has started in emerging economies, where policy rates remain well below historical averages.",
        "This outlook points to increased uncertainties and a slight tightening in global financial conditions compared to the previous MPC Meeting period.",
        "Uncertainties regarding the course of long-term bond rates lead to volatility in global financial markets.",
        "The Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures increase data-sensitivity in monetary policies and global financial markets in turn, which may lead to volatilities.",
        "Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio inflows to emerging economies have been favorable in both bond markets and equity markets.",
        "Nonetheless, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.",
        "Driven by international commodity prices, exchange rate developments and supply constraints, producer prices recorded a high rate of increase also in May, which spread across the sectors.",
        "Although non-energy commodity prices displayed a slightly favorable outlook in June, it is considered that cost pressures on consumer prices have remained strong because of the depreciation in the Turkish lira and cumulative effects.",
        "Loan growth exhibits a mild course owing to the monetary tightening.",
        "However, short-term trends show that retail loan utilization has increased notably owing also to the deferred demand because of pandemic-led restrictions.",
        "The Committee assessed that a milder growth in retail loans is critical to curb risks to the inflation outlook and external balance.",
        "Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are monitored for macroeconomic stability.",
        "Domestic economic activity is strong.",
        "Having increased by 7.0% annually and 1.7% quarterly in the first quarter of 2021, GDP confirmed the past evaluations of economic activity being above its potential despite the restraining effects of the pandemic.",
        "In this period, final domestic demand slowed down due to private consumption, while total investments and net exports made a positive contribution to the quarterly growth.",
        "On the production side, while the industrial and construction value-added were the main determinant of quarterly growth, the services value-added made a limited contribution to growth due to pandemic-led restrictions.",
        "While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong.",
        "The April readings of industrial production, turnover index and retail sales volume index revealed that the measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic as of mid-April restricted the economic activity.",
        "In April, the industrial production index decreased by 0.9% month-on-month and 0.3% quarter-on-quarter.",
        "Industrial turnover indices suggested that the slowdown in this period was driven by domestic demand.",
        "Likewise, while the services turnover index declined due to accommodation and catering services, the retail sales volume also went down amid restrictions.",
        "High-frequency data indicate that the additional pandemic measures announced for the 29 April- period continued to slow down economic activity, and that, along with the gradual normalization steps, the rapidly increasing mobility exceeding the levels before the measures, point to a significant recovery in economic activity in the subsequent period.",
        "In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered substantial increases starting from the second half of May.",
        "For the period ahead, the acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.",
        "The impact of restrictions on economic activity was also reflected in the labor market.",
        "While non-farm employment dropped by 1.1% in April over the previous month, the total unemployment rate rose by 0.9 points to 13.9%.",
        "High-frequency data suggest a rapid recovery in job opportunities and labor force participation rates following the easing of restrictions.",
        "In this respect, it is assessed that there may be employment increases in the services sector in the upcoming period.",
        "However, the rise in the labor force participation rates may limit the impact of employment increases on unemployment rates.",
        "In April, the seasonally-adjusted current account balance started to improve.",
        "According to preliminary foreign trade data for May, seasonally-adjusted exports and imports excluding gold increased on a monthly basis.",
        "Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the slowdown in credit growth, the significant fall in gold imports and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities are expected to accelerate the ongoing improvement in the current account balance.",
        "The Committee maintained its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.",
        "The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target.",
        "Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.",
        "In addition to the recent import-price-based cost factors, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook.",
        "On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed.",
        "Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 19%.",
        "Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices in the lead.",
        "The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.",
        "The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is reached.",
        "The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs.",
        "This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.",
        "Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices.",
        "The ongoing improvement in the current account balance is expected to become more evident in the upcoming months due to the developments in foreign trade and tourism.",
        "On the other hand, the outlook for domestic demand, international prices and global risk appetite heightens the risks arising from external financing needs to the balance of payments.",
        "In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.",
        "The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.",
        "The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.",
        "Consumer prices rose by 1.08% in March, and annual inflation increased by 0.58 points to 16.19%.",
        "Annual inflation increased in energy, services and core goods groups, but declined in the food group.",
        "Against this background, annual inflation rates of B and C indices increased, and their trends remained high despite some decline.",
        "Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.13% in March, and the group's annual inflation fell by 0.96 points to 17.44%.",
        "While this was largely due to annual unprocessed food inflation declining to 14.98%, annual processed food inflation rose slightly to 19.87%.",
        "The decline in annual unprocessed food inflation was led by the recently mild course of fresh fruit and vegetable prices.",
        "Seasonally adjusted data indicate that fruit and vegetable prices fell in March, while the increase in other unprocessed food prices slowed.",
        "After upswings in January and February, processed food prices continued to rise in March, albeit at a slower rate.",
        "International oil prices continued to rise, and domestic prices of fats and oils continued to climb, although at a slowing pace.",
        "Prices of international agricultural commodities, which have been on the rise for a long time, have recently displayed a more moderate outlook.",
        "Leading indicators suggest that annual food inflation continued to fall in the first half of April.",

        "Bottled gas and natural gas prices increased by 2.81% and 0.93%, respectively, in March, while fuel prices fell by 0.69%.",
        "Despite the rise in international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments, their impact on fuel prices was prevented by the sliding scale system and the price cap practice that helps this system to be more effective.",
        "Currently, the sliding scale system eliminates an important inflationary effect given the direct and indirect effects of fuel prices.",
        "The upward trend in annual energy inflation is expected to continue in April due to the base effect.",
        "Core goods prices rose by 1.39% in March, and the group's annual inflation rose by 0.44 points to 22.14%.",
        "Annual inflation increased in clothing and footwear and other core goods, but declined slightly in durable goods.",
        "Across other core goods, prices were notably higher in household repair-maintenance and personal care products with high exchange rate pass-through in addition to the lingering effect of adjustments to prices of medicine.",
        "Durable goods prices had a limited increase in March due to supply constraints and rising international industrial metal prices.",
        "Furniture and automobile prices rose in this period, while prices of electrical and non-electrical appliances decreased, easing the rise in the group’s prices.",
        "Prices of services increased by 1.26% in March, and the group's annual inflation rose by 0.82 points to 12.56%.",
        "Annual inflation increased in restaurants-hotels, communication and other services, but followed a flat course in rents and transport services.",
        "With the easing of pandemic measures, restaurants-hotels prices increased significantly in March.",
        "Cost increases during the period when activities were interrupted passed through to prices, while the increasing demand, triggered by capacity constraints, was another factor that put pressure on prices.",
        "Prices of communication services rose amid the lingering effects of the increases in the special communication tax.",
        "Among items grouped within other services, education and recreation services diverged negatively due to sharp price increases.",
        "The increase in prices of recreation services was driven by the easing of pandemic measures.",
        "On the other hand, prices of education services increased on the back of the backward indexation in private school tuitions as well as the expiration of temporary VAT reductions.",
        "According to the results of the CBRT Survey of Expectations, participants’ inflation expectations have increased in April.",
        "While the current year-end inflation expectation increased by 1.58 points to 13.12% in April, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations rose by 0.79 points and 0.37 points to 11.26% and 9.55%, respectively.",
        "The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process.",
        "This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade.",
        "However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the course of the pandemic.",
        "In this period, the upward trend in commodity prices has decelerated.",
        "In tandem with the recovery in expectations of growth in advanced economies, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.",
        "Long-term bond rates lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets.",
        "Nevertheless, the Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures might cause an earlier-than-projected tightening in monetary policies, and maintained its assessment that a period marked by increased data-sensitivity and related volatilities in global financial markets was entered.",
        "Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio flows to emerging economies have continued at an accelerated rate in bond markets and at a milder pace in equity markets.",
        "The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies keeps the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.",

        "Commodity prices have registered some deceleration in the recent period.",
        "However, inflationary effects arising from disruptions in supply chains persist.",
        "While commercial loans exhibit a moderate course, an upward trend is observed in consumer loan growth despite tightening financial conditions.",
        "Noting that demand and cost-side inflationary effects persisted, the Committee maintained its assessment that the risks to the year-end forecast target announced in the January Inflation Report were on the upside.",
        "Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong, led by domestic and external demand.",
        "In January-February period, industrial production rose by 2.3% compared to the previous quarter, and continued to hover above its long-term trend despite the constraining effect of the pandemic in this period.",
        "The strong momentum in manufacturing industry activity has widely spread across sectors, being particularly significant in intermediate and durable consumer goods.",
        "On the other hand, the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions.",
        "In February, nonfarm employment remained flat while total and nonfarm unemployment rates rose by 0.7 points to 13.4% and 15.3%, respectively, due to the increase in the participation rate.",
        "During this period, employment increased in the services and construction sectors, but decreased in the industry sector.",

        "On the other hand, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors and the adjustments in wages and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "While the expectation that the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand to become more significant is maintained, the projected gradual waning in demand and cost factors is being delayed by the recent upward trend in credit growth and increase in import costs.",
        "As a result of pandemic-driven expansionary policies, inflation expectations have been increasing recently in the United States, causing long-term bond yields to rise, and thus the global risk appetite to follow a volatile course and emerging market currencies to depreciate.",

        "Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.",
        "The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached.",
        "Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.",

        "Evaluating the output gap indicators related to the cyclical state of the economy, the Committee concluded that despite the constraining effect of unemployment and tourism, aggregate demand conditions remained inflationary in the last quarter due to the cumulative effects of the strong credit impulse and external demand.",
        "It was judged that economic activity reached its cyclical peak in the last quarter and started to converge towards its trend owing to the deceleration in the first quarter.",
        "Some members of the Committee indicated that the deceleration in the first quarter was largely driven by the sectors adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions and that the effects of the monetary policy tightening are yet to be felt.",

        "On the other hand, the developments in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices remain important to the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "As the lagged effects of the credit slowdown are expected to become apparent in the upcoming period, inflation may increase further in the coming few months due to supply-side inflationary factors that are significant in the short run.",
        "The additional inflation rigidity to be driven by the minimum wage through the services prices channel in particular, necessitates an extended period of a tight monetary policy stance compared to past projections.",
        "The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.",
        "Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance decisively for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability.",
        "As regards to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon.",
        "Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.",
        "Besides the current information set, if any new information arrives pointing at the risk of inflation expectations and pricing behavior diverging from the medium-term target path, additional front-loaded tightening will be implemented.",
        "The tight monetary policy stance, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.",
        "The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.",
        "In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors.",

        "It should be noted that annual inflation in the energy group will also rise significantly in January due to base effects.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.91 points to 7.48% in December, partly due to the low base effect from the same period last year.",
        "In this period, annual inflation increased in clothing and durable goods but slightly decreased in other core goods.",
        "The increase in durable goods prices is attributable to depreciation of the Turkish lira.",

        "Leading indicators signal that the partial improvement in unemployment rates continues, while the weakness in the labor market prevails.",

        "The expectation that recently adopted accommodative stance of monetary policies in advanced economies, the US in particular, is likely to be maintained over a medium term horizon under current circumstances, and its implications for global financial conditions have paved the way for expansionary policies in emerging market economies as well.",
        "Current global financial conditions and the recent partial improvement in expectations regarding global trade support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite.",
        "Accordingly, portfolio flows towards emerging economies have presented a more favorable outlook compared to the previous meeting period.",

        "Thus, TL-denominated loans, consumer loans in particular, remained on the rise thanks to improved financing conditions and recovering domestic demand.",
        "This rise can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as postponed loan demand and loan restructuring.",
        "The more flexible and effective use of required reserves as a countercyclical macroprudential tool in this period supports credit growth and financial stability.",
        "The aim of the reserve requirement practice introduced on was to channel credit supply towards production-oriented sectors rather than consumption and encourage the use of long-term commercial loans that have a strong relation with production and investment, and long-term mortgage loans that have a weak relation with imports.",
        "In the upcoming period, with the improvement in liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector, the fall in interest rates and adjustments in required reserves are expected to further support credit growth.",

        "In this context, in order to support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of the fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.",
        "The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior.",
        "If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.",
        "Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic framework are expected to support the achievement of price stability.",
        "Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.",

        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages went down by 3.60 points to 25.66% in November.",
        "This decline was mostly driven by the fall in unprocessed food prices led by fresh fruits and vegetables.",

        "Energy prices were down by 0.71% and annual inflation in this group fell by 4.08 points to 25.35%.",

        "Leading indicators for December indicate that the support from fuel prices to consumer inflation continues at a strong pace.",

        "The rate of increase in clothing prices remained significantly below periodic price increases of past years.",
        "Meanwhile, lagged effects of the exchange rate on other core goods persisted, albeit in a weaker manner.",
        "All in all, the decline in core goods inflation in November is largely attributed to temporary tax cuts, while appreciation in the Turkish lira and weaker domestic demand emerged as other factors to support the slowdown in inflation.",

        "Public consumption was another drag on quarterly growth.",

        "Accordingly, net exports are expected to contribute further to growth in the fourth quarter and limit the economic slowdown to some extent.",

        "The rising external demand led by the favorable global growth outlook and Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "According to February data, the rebound in tourism is strengthening while the number of tourists from regions whose per capita spending is relatively higher, such as Europe, is increasing.",
        "On the other hand, transport and shuttle trading remain strong.",
        "Due to the quarterly moderation in private consumption demand, imports of goods and services slowed slightly in the first quarter.",
        "The Committee noted that net exports is likely to contribute positively to quarterly growth under these circumstances.",
        "Amid the cumulative depreciation of the real exchange rate, the recovering tourism and the strengthening global growth, exports of goods and services are expected to provide further strong stimulus to growth and affect favorably the current account balance.",

        "The risks to the global economic outlook are tilted to the downside for the upcoming period.",
        "The primary downside risks to the global growth outlook are the geopolitical tensions and the growing protectionist agenda in international trade.",
        "The newly passed US tax reform is poised to provide a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered as an upside risk factor for the world economy.",
        "The US government’s announcement in March to impose additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum might spark more protectionism in international trade across the world.",
        "The extent to which such policies will affect global growth will depend on how other trading partners will respond.",
        "An analysis of risks to global inflation reveals that geopolitical developments coupled with uncertainties regarding trade policies are likely to pose upside risks to commodity prices, particularly to energy and metal prices.",
        "Moreover, in line with the falling unemployment rates in advanced economies, the possibility of wages to increase more rapidly than the current trends is among the major risk factors to push inflation up.",
        "Unless notable upside surprises occur in global inflation under the mentioned risk factors, it is considered that major central banks, the Fed and the ECB in particular, will continue to normalize monetary policy in line with expectations, and the impact on financial markets will remain limited.",
        "However, the possibility of accelerated inflation amid strong demand conditions accompanied by surging commodity prices in advanced economies may trigger a faster-than-projected tightening in these countries.",
        "In such a case, global financial markets may witness fluctuations as in early February, and emerging economies may face higher volatility in exchange rates and weakening portfolio flows.",
        "Further ahead, the baseline outlook envisages a sustained support from the favorable global economic outlook to Turkey’s external demand, an increase in portfolio flows, and a decline in commodity prices as implied by the futures markets.",
        "Under a potential scenario of waning global growth and rising commodity prices, the Turkish economy may face cost-push inflationary pressures and widened current account deficit.",
        "In such a case, the CBRT will formulate the monetary policy response assessing the disinflationary impact of weaker demand conditions in tandem with the second-round effects of cost pressures on inflation.",
        "Should this scenario be accompanied by portfolio outflows, the extent of the pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to consumer prices and the potential impact on overall financial stability will shape the monetary policy response as well.",
        "The volatility in global financial markets in February coupled with geopolitical developments had reflections on domestic financial conditions as well.",
        "Accordingly, the risk premium increased slightly, portfolio flows declined, the Turkish lira depreciated with a rise in volatility, and interest rates in financial markets as well as loan rates increased.",
        "The credit market reveals that the accelerating effect of the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) support of 2017 have dissipated to a great extent.",
        "In addition to the developments in commercial loans, the consequences of the deceleration in consumer loans on economic activity are monitored closely.",
        "All in all, the domestic financial conditions are expected to remain on the current trajectory, should the rising trend of external interest rates continues as per expectations.",
        "The fiscal measures and incentives to support the economic activity as well as the CGF-backed credit expansion produced a strong recovery in domestic demand in 2017, thereby weakening the disinflationary transmission of monetary policy.",
        "The expansionary effect of these policies, also taking into account the lagged effects, are estimated to have peaked in the first quarter of 2018, and the economic activity is expected to start to revert to its main trend from the second quarter on, which will gradually lessen the effect of aggregate demand conditions on inflation.",
        "Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets and the cumulative real exchange rate depreciation, as well as the favorable global growth outlook for 2018 are expected to continue supporting exports and growth.",
        "A relatively moderate outlook for domestic demand is expected as a result of the waning effect of the supportive policies.",
        "Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks to growth.",
        "Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.",
        "In the first quarter of 2018, cost pressures played a significant role in shaping not only producer prices but also consumer prices led also by the robust demand conditions.",
        "High levels of inflation and the rise in inflation expectations keep the risks to the pricing behavior alive.",
        "For instance, the fact that the producer price inflation improved only slightly in the first quarter despite the relatively mild course of input costs indicates that firms can raise prices more easily in the high inflation environment.",
        "Indeed, the diffusion indices show evidence that the economic agents’ tendency to raise prices rose to quite high levels in the first quarter.",
        "In addition, wage increases hinder the improvement in services inflation because of the sector’s labor-intensive structure.",
        "As a result of the significant backward indexation behavior in the service sector, inflation inertia is strong in this sector.",
        "Productivity gains are imperative to contain the adverse effect of rigidities arising from wage and price setting behaviors on price stability.",
        "The risks are on the upside for food inflation, another significant factor underlying the inflation forecasts.",
        "Despite a decline in the second half of 2017 due to the import measures, the red meat prices surged in the first quarter of 2018.",
        "Given the supply conditions in the sector, the red meat prices constitute an upside risk factor to food prices in the remainder of the year.",
        "The projections for food inflation are based on the assumption that measures taken by the Food Committee will balance considerably the upside risks to food prices.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be presented in the April Inflation Report.",
        "Accordingly, the inflation forecast for end-2018 was revised upwards by 0.5 points, while that for 2019 was kept intact.",
        "Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the 5-percent target, falling to 8.4 percent at the end of 2018, 6.5 percent at the end of 2019, and stabilizing around 5 percent over the medium term.",
        "The Committee judges that the rigidity in the underlying inflation indicators and the high levels of core inflation in the first quarter continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior, and in addition, that the recent rise in import prices also weighs on these risks.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a measured monetary tightening in April to support price stability.",
        "The Committee also assessed the technical presentations on finalizing the simplification process of the monetary policy’s operational framework and enhancing the predictability of monetary policy.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets.",
        "Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Public finance has been providing more support to disinflation, which confirms the stronger coordination between monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "There was no significant inflationary impact arising from tax increases throughout 2017.",
        "The joint efforts to transform policy coordination into a continuous and systematic framework will contribute to disinflation in 2018 as well.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",
        "Moreover, sustaining structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability and social welfare.",
        "In June, consumer prices rose by 2.61 percent and annual inflation increased by 3.24 points to 15.39 percent.",
        "The rise in annual inflation was widespread across subcategories, with the most significant contribution coming from unprocessed food.",
        "Cost pressures from recent exchange rate developments drove prices higher in many related items.",
        "Producer prices exerted even stronger upward pressure on consumer prices compared to a month earlier.",
        "Thus, core indicators saw a notable increase in both their annual inflation rates and underlying trends.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 7.89 points to 18.89 percent in June.",
        "This increase was driven by the unprocessed food inflation that soared due to vegetables prices.",
        "In this period, there was significant divergence between the producer prices for PPI for agriculture and the consumer prices for food.",
        "The widening gap between producer and consumer price levels for some vegetables signaled market problems associated with the distribution channel.",
        "Meanwhile, processed food prices recorded increases across all subcategories, pushing annual processed food inflation up to 14.47 percent.",
        "In the upcoming period, bread and raw milk reference purchase prices might put upward pressure on processed food prices.",
        "Energy prices increased by 1.01 percent in June and annual energy inflation rose by 1.82 points to 16.99 percent.",
        "Solid fuel, bottled gas and administered municipal water prices were up, whereas fuel prices remained flat due to the new sliding-scale tariff system.",
        "In the period ahead, administered energy prices will likely reflect the cumulative cost pressures from exchange rates and oil prices.",
        "In June, annual services inflation increased by 1.44 points to 10.96 percent.",
        "The rise in services inflation was widespread across subcategories.",
        "Communication services inflation went up on the back of internet tariffs, while transport services inflation was driven higher by cumulative cost pressures and the buoyant domestic and international tourism industry.",
        "The tourism upsurge was the main driver of price hikes in related subcategories, such as catering, accommodation and package tours.",
        "In summary, prices of services reflected not only cost pressures from exchange rates, oil prices and food prices but also demand-side effects of the favorable tourism outlook.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 2.57 points to 18.55 percent in June, largely due to recent exchange rate developments.",
        "Thus, prices of durable goods and other core goods posted sharp widespread increases.",
        "Clothing inflation, however, remained flat in this period.",
        "The exchange rate-driven rise in costs is likely to put further inflationary pressure on prices of core goods in coming months.",
        "Economic activity proved a little stronger than projected in the first quarter of 2018.",
        "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 2.0 percent on a quarterly basis and 7.4 percent on an annual basis.",
        "Main driver of quarterly growth was domestic demand, particularly private consumption in the first quarter.",
        "Investment offered rather limited support to growth due to the muted course of machinery-equipment investments.",
        "Net exports contributed positively to quarterly growth owing both to the contraction in imports coupled with the rebound in tourism.",
        "Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in economic activity.",
        "Data for the second quarter reveal that external demand maintains its strength.",
        "Amid favorable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The Committee noted that the rebound in revenues from tourism and other services is rather brisk, and under these circumstances, net exports will provide positive contribution to quarterly growth in the second quarter as well.",
        "In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to have further positive repercussions on the current account balance.",
        "In the second quarter, signs of deceleration in domestic demand became more visible.",
        "In this period, the depreciation in the Turkish lira accompanied by the increased financial volatility, perceptions of uncertainty and financing costs decelerated domestic demand both through the consumption and investment expenditures channels.",
        "The slowdown in domestically-oriented sectors, particularly sectors affiliated to construction, confirms this outlook.",
        "Meanwhile, accommodative stance of the public sector conducted through expenditures and fiscal measures are projected to moderate the slowdown in domestic demand to some extent.",
        "Survey indicators point that the rebalancing process in economic activity may continue in the third quarter.",
        "The ongoing improvement in the labor market came to halt in the second quarter, as the economic activity started to lose pace and converge to its underlying trend.",
        "Employment in the services and industrial sectors posted mild increases in April, while the evident fall in construction employment led to a quarterly decline in non-farm employment.",
        "In sum, data for the second quarter indicate that economic activity has assumed a rebalancing process both in terms of growth rate and composition.",
        "However, the downside risks to the magnitude and duration of the slowdown in economic activity are kept alive by the high level of financial volatility and perceptions of uncertainty.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term inflation forecasts for the July Inflation Report as well.",
        "Accordingly, year-end consumer inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were revised upwards by 5 points and 2.8 points, respectively compared to the April forecast.",
        "With a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down with enhanced policy coordination, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the target.",
        "Accordingly, inflation is projected to be 13.4 percent at the end of 2018 and then fall to 9.3 percent at the end of 2019, 6.7 percent at the end of 2020, stabilizing around 5 percent over the medium term.",
        "Forecasts are based on a monetary policy framework that envisaged that the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained for an extended period.",
        "Cost factors and volatility in food prices have been the main drivers of the recent upsurge in inflation.",
        "On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors.",
        "Despite the milder impact of demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee assessed that it might be necessary to maintain a tight monetary stance for an extended period.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "The outlook that the medium-term projections presented in the Inflation Report is based on the Monetary Policy Committee's judgments and assumptions.",
        "Nevertheless, various risks to these factors may affect the inflation outlook and necessitate changes in the monetary policy stance envisaged in the baseline scenario.",
        "The Committee evaluated that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook are mostly on the upside.",
        "The pricing behavior, developments in global risk appetite, the contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing, and the lagged effects of the monetary policy will be monitored closely in the coming period.",
        "Should these factors deviate from the baseline scenario, the monetary policy stance will be reviewed depending on the change in the inflation outlook.",
        "In August, consumer prices rose by 2.30 percent and annual inflation increased by 2.05 points to 17.90 percent.",
        "The rise in annual inflation was widespread across subcategories, with the most significant contribution coming from core goods and energy groups due to exchange rate developments.",
        "In the recent period, cost pressures have elevated, economic units’ tendency to raise prices has become stronger.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.35 points to 19.75 percent in August.",
        "In this period, seasonally adjusted unprocessed food prices remained almost flat.",
        "Meanwhile, processed food prices increased by 2.12 percent in August, mainly due to exchange rates and developments in the prices of products used as input for processed food.",
        "In August, energy prices increased by 5.37 percent and annual inflation in this group increased by 3.85 points to 21.34 percent.",
        "The rise was mainly driven by increments in electricity and natural gas prices as well as increased fuel oil prices due to Special Consumption Tax (SCT) arrangements.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 3.60 points to 23.18 percent in August.",
        "The durable goods and other core goods prices continued to increase across subcategories due to exchange rate developments.",
        "Prices of durable consumption goods increased by 5.49 percent.",
        "The seasonal sales in clothing group remained limited compared to previous years.",
        "Annual services inflation increased by 0.80 points to 11.84 percent.",
        "Transportation services inflation went up on the back of rapid rises in tourism and fuel-oil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the uptrend in accommodation services continued due to exchange rate developments and robust tourism activities.",
        "In the second quarter of 2018, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 0.9 percent quarterly and by 5.2 percent annually.",
        "Thus, economic activity slowed down to converge to its underlying trend and rebalanced in terms of its composition.",
        "In the second quarter, the main driver of the quarterly growth was net exports backed by the recovery in tourism.",
        "Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in the economic activity.",
        "According to the third quarter data, external demand maintains its strength.",
        "Amid a stable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The Committee noted that the recovery in revenues from tourism and other services is rather strong, and under these circumstances, the positive contribution of net exports to quarterly growth may increase also in the third quarter.",
        "In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to maintain its positive impact on the current account balance.",
        "Data on global economy indicate that growth has stabilized and remained strong, offering a positive outlook for the  year end.",
        "Despite the rise in commodity and energy prices due to positive global growth, consumer and core inflation rates continue to follow a moderate course worldwide.",
        "Downside risks to the global growth outlook are assessed to be more evident in the upcoming period.",
        "Geopolitical developments and increased discourse of protectionism in foreign trade stand out as the main risk factors that may deteriorate  the global growth outlook.",
        "An assessment of global inflation risks reveals that geopolitical developments and uncertainties about foreign trade policies may pose an upward risk to commodity prices, particularly energy and metal prices.",
        "Moreover, the likelihood of an acceleration in wages in advanced economies due to falling unemployment rates is also one of the most important risk factors for inflation in these countries.",
        "Financial conditions in advanced economies have tightened in the recent period.",
        "The probability of acceleration in inflation due to strong demand and the rise in commodity prices creates a risk that may trigger a faster-than-expected tightening in the monetary policies of these economies.",
        "In particular, the ongoing positive growth performance and the new tax law in the US that can be seen as an expansionary fiscal policy increases the probability of Fed to expedite the monetary policy normalization process.",
        "In sum, geopolitical uncertainties, weakening capital flows towards emerging economies, and the expansion of protectionism discourse in foreign trade continue to affect the outlook in emerging economies.",
        "In this period of high volatility in financial markets, cost pressures and their second-round effects have negatively affected the inflation outlook.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee has delivered a strong monetary tightening in September to support price stability and raised the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) to 24 percent from 17.75 percent.",
        "It has also announced that the Central Bank funding, which used to be provided through overnight lending, will be provided via one-week repo auctions.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "The enhanced coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy is believed to play an important role in disinflation efforts and macroeconomic rebalancing.",
        "Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and social welfare.",
        "In December, consumer prices rose by 0.69 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 1.06 points to 11.92 percent.",
        "Annual inflation recorded a decline in food and energy groups, but increased in the core goods group.",
        "The fall in food inflation was led by the unprocessed group, while core goods group was largely affected by the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira.",
        "Against these developments, annual inflation in core indicators increased slightly and their underlying trend remained high.",
        "In December, annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages receded by 1.99 points to 13.79 percent.",
        "This fall was largely driven by unprocessed food prices due to the base effect accompanied by the sustained decline in red meat prices.",
        "Meanwhile, having soared lately, processed food prices rose moderately in December.",
        "The surge in prices of cheese and other dairy products in recent months turned flat due to the muted rise in raw milk prices.",
        "In line with red meat prices, processed meat products recorded a decline.",
        "Owing to the change in the basis weight in the Bread Communique, processed food prices entail the risk of an upsurge in January.",
        "Nevertheless, leading indicators for January hint at a downtrend in the annual food inflation to be led by the unprocessed food group.",
        "The uptrend in international oil prices weigh on energy prices.",
        "Accordingly, energy prices registered an increase in December, yet the group’s annual inflation declined due to the base effect.",
        "Despite the increase in electricity prices, leading indicators hint at a similar decline in energy inflation due to the base effect in January as well.",
        "Prices of services inched up by 0.43 percent in December and the annual services inflation remained almost unchanged at 9.47 percent.",
        "In this period annual inflation increased in transport services; remained relatively flat in the restaurants-hotels and communications group, but decreased in other groups.",
        "Fuel prices, which surged amid the depreciated Turkish lira coupled with the rise in oil prices, aggravate inflation in transport services.",
        "Meanwhile, the robust course of demand conditions in certain groups and the headline-inflation indexation stiffens the elevated levels in services inflation.",
        "Annual core goods inflation crept up by 0.40 points and reached 15.45 percent in December.",
        "This was led by the prices of durable goods that increased parallel to the soaring prices of automobiles and white goods.",
        "Thus, inflation in durable goods reached 18 percent.",
        "Price increases in other core goods accelerated in tandem with the cumulative exchange rate effects in products with high import component.",
        "The effect of the methodological change in the clothing group continued with a weaker pace.",
        "The rebound in manufacturing in the clothing sector coupled with the improvement in tourism fueled the rise in group’s inflation across the year.",
        "In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.",
        "Recently-released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength.",
        "A joint analysis of October and November data suggests sustained growth in industrial production with some deceleration in the fourth quarter.",
        "However, this deceleration stems from the slowing activity in sectors subject to tax incentives, particularly furniture, and other sectors do not register a loss of momentum.",
        "Survey indicators show that this trend is maintained in December as well.",
        "Indicators for services and trade stand moderate, while the recovery in the tourism sector spurs economic activity further.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand.",
        "In the fourth quarter, private consumption growth is expected to lose some pace following the withdrawal of tax reductions in white goods and furniture.",
        "On the other hand, current indicators show that the third-quarter improvement in machinery-equipment investments continues.",
        "The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly in the EU, rising external demand and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The improvement in the import demand in tandem with the course of economic activity notwithstanding, the rise in exports of goods slows the deterioration in the core current account deficit indicators.",
        "In addition to the ongoing recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.",
        "The Committee noted that the contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth will continue in the fourth quarter owing to the strong course of exports accompanied by the slowing gold imports.",
        "The second and third-quarter recovery in the labor market continued in the October period, confirming that economic activity remains robust.",
        "Employment increased in services and industry, but receded in the construction sector compared to the previous period.",
        "Survey data suggest the rise in employment coupled with the fall in unemployment rates will continue.",
        "The Committee highlighted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the strong uptrend in the labor force participation rate.",
        "Against this background, the unemployment rate is anticipated to decline gradually in the period ahead.",
        "In sum, recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.",
        "Data on global growth hint at continued simultaneous recovery in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "PMI indicators pointing to growth for both markets and the upgraded growth forecasts, particularly for the euro area, confirm the steady economic rebound across the globe.",
        "Global inflation has been volatile amid changing commodity and oil prices yet remains low, whereas global core inflation remains stable.",
        "The primary downside risks to the global economic outlook over the upcoming period are the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula and the heightened protectionism clouding international trade negotiations.",
        "Moreover, the US tax reform is considered a positive risk factor for the world economy.",
        "With the Federal Reserve and the ECB in the lead, major central banks continue to normalize monetary policy.",
        "As the steps towards normalization have been in line with expectations, the market reaction is currently mild.",
        "However, risks to monetary policy tightening are more on the upside.",
        "With the ongoing economic recovery in the US, the Fed demonstrated its commitment to policy normalization.",
        "The strengthening euro area economy increases the possibility of an earlier-than-anticipated tightening of the ECB monetary policy.",
        "Despite the favorable course of the labor market in advanced countries, the limited increase in wages, while limiting price increases, poses an upward risk in terms of inflation in the upcoming period.",
        "Another key factor that might deteriorate the stable global inflation is the recent movements in oil prices.",
        "The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite drive strong portfolio flows into emerging economies.",
        "In 2018, it is estimated that portfolio inflows will continue in the case of sustained economic recovery and a moderate course in monetary policy normalization of advanced economies.",
        "Meanwhile, portfolio investments to Turkey may at times be volatile amid geopolitical risks.",
        "Both global and domestic financial conditions have generally been supportive of economic activity.",
        "Since the December MPC meeting, financial indicators such as exchange rate volatility, market interest rates and risk premium have alleviated thanks to the CBRT policies and the interruption in the negative news flow.",
        "Due to the CBRT’s tighter monetary stance, the downward slope of the yield curve has become more pronounced.",
        "The loan growth that hovers around historical averages as the loans guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund hit the pre-determined upper limit in mid-2017 is monitored closely with regard to its impact on aggregate demand and economic activity.",
        "Domestic demand has slowed slightly due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the withdrawal of tax incentives for durable goods, and economic growth has started to move towards its underlying trend as of the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "The accommodative policies of 2017 will have less of an effect in 2018 while the fiscal measures to be introduced within the context of the Medium Term Program and the tight monetary stance are expected to be the main drivers of loan growth and a normalized economic activity.",
        "Moreover, the smaller yet ongoing Credit Guarantee Fund support will support domestic demand in 2018.",
        "The steady recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel.",
        "Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain key to economic activity.",
        "Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.",
        "Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.",
        "Having pulled annual consumer inflation down in December largely on the back of base effects and weather conditions, food and energy prices might shape consumer prices over the first quarter of 2018, particularly due to upward and downward volatility in unprocessed food prices.",
        "In addition, changes in oil prices put upward pressure on domestic energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core goods inflation remains on the rise amid cumulative exchange rate effects, and aggregate demand conditions support this uptrend.",
        "Given also the elevated services inflation, the Committee assesses that there is no significant improvement in the core inflation outlook.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and kept the Late Liquidity Window (LON) lending rate at 12.75 percent.",
        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets.",
        "The Committee formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year.",
        "Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",
        "Moreover, continuation of structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability process and social welfare.",
        "In February, consumer prices rose by 0.73 percent and annual inflation receded by 0.09 points to 10.26 percent.",
        "Annual inflation was down in energy and core goods, but up in food and services.",
        "Energy inflation was pulled down by falling oil prices as well as relatively stable exchange rates.",
        "Annual core goods inflation slowed slightly while food inflation was driven higher by both processed and unprocessed food prices.",
        "Thus, the annual inflation of core indicators recorded a small decrease while their underlying trend remained high.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was up by 1.51 points to 10.27 percent in February.",
        "Annual unprocessed food inflation accelerated to 6.71 percent, due to rising prices of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as higher milk and red meat prices.",
        "On this account, being adversely affected, annual processed food inflation hit a nine-year high of 13.76 percent.",
        "In this category, prices of cheese and other dairy goods, fats and processed meat recorded sharp gains.",
        "In addition, bread prices that went up due to the adjustment in the Bread Regulation and prices of nonalcoholic beverages that were driven higher by the new Special Consumption Tax (SCT) applied to some beverages put upward pressure on annual processed food inflation.",
        "Energy prices fell by 0.58 percent in February amid sliding international oil prices and moderating exchange rates, and annual inflation dropped to 6.92 percent in this category.",
        "Annual services inflation increased by 0.14 points to 9.37 percent in February, largely due to the subcategory of other services, the inflation of which was pushed up by rising prices of package tours and health services.",
        "Meanwhile, annual inflation was relatively flat in rents, restaurants-hotels and telecommunications, but continued to decline in transport services.",
        "Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.65 points to 14.93 percent in February.",
        "Annual inflation was down across all subcategories yet remained high.",
        "The rise in annual clothing inflation was prompted by cumulative cost developments and robust aggregate demand conditions.",
        "Prices of durable goods posted a month-on-month increase due to furniture and automobile prices.",
        "Other core goods, on the other hand, saw a lower annual inflation rate thanks to base effects but their prices were up due to home maintenance-repair and medicines.",
        "It should be noted that the remaining impact of the mid-February increase of 15 percent in medicine prices caused by the reference exchange rate will also be felt in March.",
        "In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior.",
        "Underlying trend indicators display inertia and core inflation remains elevated.",
        "Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength.",
        "Industrial production continued to grow in the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower rate.",
        "However, this deceleration stems from the slack in sectors subject to tax incentives, particularly furniture, whereas other sectors see no loss of momentum.",
        "Survey indicators hint at strong industrial output across subsectors for January and February.",

        "The upbeat growth outlook across the globe, particularly in the European Union (EU), rising external demand and Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "Notwithstanding the recovering import demand aided by the buoyant economy, gains in exports of goods helped slow down the deterioration of the core current-account-deficit indicators.",
        "The uptrend in exports of goods, coupled with the ongoing tourism rebound, will likely contribute further to the current account balance over the upcoming period.",
        "The Committee noted that the contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth will increase in the fourth quarter owing to brisk exports accompanied by slowing gold imports.",

        "Employment surged in services and construction sectors in this period, but remained constant in the industrial sector compared to the previous period.",
        "Survey data hints at further employment gains and lower unemployment rates for the upcoming period.",
        "The Committee highlighted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the upswing in labor force participation.",
        "Thus, unemployment rates are expected to decline gradually in the period ahead.",
        "In short, recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength.",
        "Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.",
        "Fourth-quarter data of the previous year on global growth signal continued simultaneous recovery in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "PMI indicators pointing to growth for both markets and the upgraded growth forecasts, particularly for the EU, confirm the steady economic rebound across the globe.",
        "The primary downside risks to the global economic outlook for the upcoming period are the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the heightened protectionism clouding international trade negotiations.",
        "In fact, the recent US plan to impose extra customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum might spark more protectionism in foreign trade across the world.",
        "Moreover, the newly passed US tax reform has provided a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered an upside risk factor for the world economy.",

        "A second risk factor to stimulate global inflation is the possibility of an upsurge in wages following the fall in unemployment rates in advanced economies.",
        "In fact, following the announcement of the US labor market data in early February, acceleration in inflation proved more likely.",
        "With the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) in the lead, major central banks continue to normalize monetary policy.",
        "However, risks to monetary tightening are more on the upside due to the possibility of accelerating inflation.",
        "In fact, higher volatility emerged in global financial markets and, particularly in the US, a decline was witnessed in the stock exchange amid concerns over the possibility of accelerating inflation and faster-than-projected monetary tightening by the Fed following the labor market data in the US.",
        "The stronger growth outlook also for the European Union is likely to cause a sooner-than-expected tightening in the ECB’s monetary policy.",
        "Unless upside surprises occur in inflation in the period ahead, it is considered that the Fed’s and the ECB’s steps towards normalization will be in line with expectations.",
        "The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite drive strong portfolio flows into emerging economies.",

        "With the diminishing effect of the macroprudential incentives and the CGF support granted last year in Turkey, credit growth reverted to historical averages.",
        "Meanwhile, underpinned also by the robust domestic demand, loan rates trended upwards.",
        "In 2018, the release of the new CGF-backed tranches is expected to accelerate the extension of credits, particularly for investment purposes.",
        "Financing the new credits, to be extended by banks, through core liabilities and long-term resources is significant.",
        "Effects of growth and composition of credits on aggregate demand and economic activity are monitored closely.",
        "The reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the expiry of tax incentives on durable goods have led domestic demand to lose pace and economic growth to move towards its underlying trend as of the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "In 2018, in addition to the fading effect accommodative policies of 2017, the tight monetary stance and the fiscal measures under the MTP are likely to appear as the main drivers of loan growth and a normalized economic activity.",
        "Meanwhile, the continued support from the CGF, albeit limited, will stand as a factor to stimulate domestic demand in 2018.",
        "The steady recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel.",
        "Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain a key element of economic activity.",
        "Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.",

        "The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets.",
        "The Committee formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year.",
        "Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",

        "Effects of exchange rate developments were apparent in many items, particularly on core goods, while items with relatively low exchange rate pass-through also recorded noticeable price hikes.",
        "Elevated exchange rate volatility weighed on inflation uncertainty, while backward-indexation in inflation trended upwards and exchange rate pass-through to consumer inflation remained strong, which resulted in a notable deterioration in the pricing behavior.",
        "Although aggregate demand conditions started to support disinflation, the course of consumer inflation was mostly shaped by the elevated producer inflation-driven cost pressures.",
        "Against this background, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators recorded a sharp increase.",

        "In September, energy prices increased by 6.05 percent and annual inflation in this group rose by 5.69 points to 27.03 percent.",
        "This rise was mainly driven by price adjustments in electricity and natural gas as well as increased fuel oil prices due to the lingering effect of Special Consumption Tax (SCT) arrangements in August.",
        "Oil prices trended upwards in this period, but the continued sliding-scale tariff restricted the possible upside risks to inflation.",
        "The rise in energy inflation is likely to move further upwards in October due to the price adjustments in electricity and natural gas.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 11.94 points to 35.12 percent in September.",
        "This rise was led by the sharp depreciation in the Turkish lira, and prices increased across all subcategories.",
        "Considerable price increases were seen particularly in durable goods with high imported content (12.93 percent) and other core goods (11.22 percent).",
        "Moreover, the clothing group registered price hikes above seasonal norms.",
        "Core goods inflation is expected to follow a favorable course in October particularly due to durable goods supported by the recent appreciation in the Turkish lira coupled with the SCT base arrangement in automobiles.",
        "In addition the All-Out War on Inflation Program is also considered to underpin the downtrend in inflation in the short term.",
        "Annual services inflation increased by 2.13 points to 13.97 percent month-on-month.",
        "The rise in the restaurants-hotels and transportation services inflation went up due to the cost-side factors led by food and fuel oil prices as well as the brisk outlook in tourism.",
        "Meanwhile, the uptrend in other services inflation is attributed to the reverberations of exchange rate developments accompanied by the price hikes in education services driven by the high levels of headline inflation.",
        "Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable.",

        "Amid a stable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The Committee noted that the brisk course of revenues from tourism and other services notably boosted the contribution of net exports to quarterly growth in the third quarter.",
        "In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to maintain its positive effect on the current account balance.",
        "The slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tighter financial conditions.",
        "Survey indicators for the last quarter show that the downtrend in the capacity utilization rate of the manufacturing industry continues across all subcategories.",
        "The deceleration in the indicators for production and orders of domestic market-oriented sectors, particularly sectors affiliated to construction, confirms this outlook.",
        "Prospects for exports and tourism-linked activities seem relatively better, yet the stance for employment and investment has recorded an overall worsening.",
        "The labor market data confirmed the evaluations that the economy lost pace in the third quarter due to the domestic demand.",
        "Sectors affiliated to foreign trade and government offered positive contributions to the services employment.",
        "However, the fall in construction employment continued and the industrial employment registered a decline compared to the previous period.",
        "Leading indicators signal a sustained increase in unemployment rates.",
        "Credit conditions have remained to be tight in the third quarter.",
        "In addition, the propensity to save in public expenditures coupled with the rise in unemployment rates hint at a further deceleration in domestic demand.",
        "Net exports are likely to boost growth further in the last quarter and curb the slowdown in economic activity to some extent.",
        "In sum, recently released data for the third quarter and the leading indicators for the last quarter point that the real adjustment in the economy continues with full speed and the rebalancing trend has become more pronounced.",

        "Under a tight policy stance focusing on bringing inflation down accompanied by reinforced policy coordination, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the targets.",
        "In this respect, inflation is projected to be 23.5 percent at end-2018, and then fall to 15.2 percent at end-2019 and 9.3 percent at end-2020 before stabilizing around 5 percent in the medium term.",
        "Forecasts are based on a monetary policy framework that envisages that the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained for an extended period.",
        "Recent developments regarding the inflation outlook point to significant risks to price stability.",
        "Price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors, reflecting the movements in exchange rates.",
        "Although weaker domestic demand conditions will partially mitigate the deterioration in the inflation outlook, upside risks to the pricing behavior continue to prevail.",
        "The significant increase in producer prices-driven cost-side pressures,  and the elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the inflation outlook in the coming period.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "The outlook that the medium-term projections presented in the Inflation Report are based on is shaped by the Monetary Policy Committee's judgments and assumptions.",
        "Nevertheless, various risks to these factors may affect the inflation outlook and necessitate changes in the monetary policy stance envisaged in the baseline scenario.",
        "The Committee noted that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook are mostly on the upside.",
        "The primary risk to inflation outlook in the upcoming period would be a further deterioration in pricing behavior.",
        "In recent months, the exchange rate pass-through to the consumer inflation has firmed, backward indexation has become more widespread, and pricing behavior has deteriorated considerably.",
        "Although it is believed that exchange rate-related inflationary pressures will remain relatively subdued under current circumstances, risks to the inflation outlook remain solid amid highly volatile exchange rates.",
        "In case of a failure in implementing the macroeconomic rebalancing process rapidly and effectively enough to bring inflation down amid high inflation rates and risk premium levels, inflation and exchange rate expectations may feed each other and undermine the disinflation process.",
        "In such a case, any further deterioration in pricing behavior may necessitate a tighter-than-envisaged monetary policy stance for a longer time in order to lower inflation.",
        "Crude oil prices and domestic food prices are also considered to constitute upside risks to inflation in the upcoming period.",
        "Although problems in the US regarding the supply of shale oil have been largely settled in the recent period, the supply shortage due to geopolitical developments in Iran and Venezuela continues to be the major upside risk to crude oil prices.",
        "On the other hand, increased protectionism in global trade stands out as a downward risk factor for commodity prices due to its likely adverse effect on global growth.",
        "Risks related to domestic food prices are projected to be on the upside because of cumulative cost-side pressures, particularly in the short term.",
        "In this framework, the monetary policy response will be determined in such a way to curb a possible deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior, taking into account the direct and secondary effects of respective risks on inflation.",
        "The deteriorated pricing behavior, tight financial conditions and the financial state of the corporate sector have recently caused inflation dynamics to change and the uncertainty over inflation and forecasts to rise.",
        "The cumulative cost pressures on firms and the decrease in their profitability, coupled with increased working capital costs and the backward indexation behaviour in wages, may cause the disinflationary impact of the demand channel to be more limited compared to the implications of the historical data.",
        "In the short-run, monetary policy decisions will be more sensitive to incoming data and the monetary policy stance will be revised upon detection of changes in the inflation outlook.",
        "In the third quarter of the year, credit conditions recorded a significantly higher tightening than historical averages due to incresing risk premiums.",
        "The rate and extent of the normalization to be observed in credit conditions in the upcoming period are important in terms of the outlook of economic activity.",
        "As cash flows and balance sheets of firms have been adversely affected by the increase in exchange rates and loan rates as well as by the slowdown in economic activity, conducting the necessary assessments and analyses related to the asset quality of firms will have a decisive role in the credit market.",
        "Therefore, establishing a coordination between the financial sector policies that restrict the balance sheet effects of the corporate sector and the monetary policy that focuses on inflation has become crucial for preventing the financial conditions from falling into an unproductive tightening cycle.",
        "There are also risks stemming from global monetary policies and risk appetite developments that may lead to a decline in capital flows towards emerging economies and feed into exchange rate volatility.",
        "The sustained monetary tightening trend and the increase in bond yields in advanced economies, heightened protectionism in global trade, Brexit developments, concerns over the budget deficit and sovereign debt of Italy, and imminent sanctions on Iran may cause the risk appetite for emerging economies to display a fluctuating pattern in the upcoming period.",
        "This, in turn, may pose a downside risk to portfolio flows to emerging economies.",
        "In case of excessive market volatility due to fluctuations in global liquidity conditions and in perceptions of risk, the CBRT may use liquidity measures intended for providing the market with the needed FX liquidity in a timely, controlled and effective manner.",
        "In addition, it may introduce additional tightening in monetary policy to curb the impact of these risks on inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "The coordination between the monetary policy and the fiscal policy is very crucial with respect to disinflation and macroeconomic rebalancing.",
        "The fiscal policy outlook that the medium-term projections in the Inflation Report are based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on disinflation and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy, which is in line with the New Economy Program announced in September.",
        "Accordingly, the projections rest on an outlook where the fiscal policy introduces a tight fiscal discipline, as envisaged in the New Economy Program.",
        "Moreover, it is assumed that administered prices, tax and wage adjustments will be formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward-indexation behavior.",
        "If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.",
        "Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the fight against inflation.",
        "Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and social welfare.",
        "In May, consumer prices rose by 1.62 percent and annual inflation increased by 1.30 points to 12.15 percent.",
        "The uptick in inflation spread across subgroups in this period.",
        "Persisting producer-price-driven cost pressures proved stronger relative to April.",
        "All in all, core indicators witnessed an increase in annual inflation, and their underlying trend maintained a high course.",
        "Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages went up by 2.19 points to 11.00 percent in May.",
        "The uptick in the annual food inflation was led by the unprocessed food group, while the annual processed food inflation remained on a downward track.",
        "Seasonally adjusted unprocessed food prices recorded a notable increase, with items such as vegetables, potato, white and red meat and eggs in the lead.",
        "Price increases in processed food, which proved high across the first quarter, decelerated further in May as in April, and the group’s annual inflation receded to 13.42 percent.",
        "Energy prices increased by 1.74 percent in May and annual energy inflation rose by 3.18 points to 15.17 percent, largely due to the low base effect accompanied by exchange rate developments and the course of oil prices.",
        "Owing to the tax arrangement in fuel products (re-arrangement of lump-sum special consumption tax amounts according to the changes in domestic refinery outlet prices due to the international oil prices or the exchange rate), it is expected that price increases in the energy group will lose pace, but the group’s annual inflation will remain on the rise in June.",
        "In May, prices of services rose by 1.17 percent and annual services inflation inched up by 0.25 points to 9.52 percent, mostly due the to transport and restaurants-hotels groups.",
        "Inflation in transport services was pushed up by highway passenger transport, while the restaurants-hotels group saw rising prices in catering and accommodation services.",
        "These groups also reflected cost pressures led by the exchange rate as well as oil and food prices in addition to demand-side effects driven by the upbeat performance in tourism.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.52 points to 15.98 percent.",
        "Annual inflation declined somewhat in the clothing group, but picked up in other subgroups.",
        "The persisting upsurge in prices of durable goods continued in May, which was led by the prices of automobiles and white goods.",
        "In the other core goods group, prices posted increases due to the items with large import content such as housing maintenance and repair equipment and domestic cleaning products.",
        "In sum, cumulative deprecation in the Turkish lira stood out as the main driver of the rise in the core goods inflation in May.",
        "The base effect and cost factors are likely to continue to exert upward pressure on annual inflation in June.",
        "Moreover, leading indicators signal that some subcategories of the unprocessed food group may register price hikes well above seasonal averages.",
        "Considered mostly temporary, this movement is monitored closely.",
        "As a result, cost factors are the main driver of the upsurge in inflation.",
        "On the other hand, price increases marked a generalized pattern across subsectors.",
        "Despite the mild outlook for demand conditions, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior.",
        "Data for the first quarter of 2018 suggest a maintained strength in economic activity.",
        "Although industrial production lost momentum in quarterly growth compared to previous quarters, its annual growth proved strong with 9.8 percent.",
        "In this period, sectors providing inetermediate inputs to the construction activity and sectors strongly affiliated to tourism supported industral production.",
        "The data reveal a mild course in sectoral activities other than industry as well.",
        "Domestic demand stood out as the main driver of quarterly growth in the first quarter.",
        "Private consumption remained on the rise, while investments, also supported by the public sector, were mainly contsruction oriented in the first quarter.",
        "Despite the sustained increase in gold imports, with the robust course in exports of goods excluding gold besides tourism revenues, net exports are expected to boost quarterly growth.",
        "Recently released data indicate a rebalancing trend in the economic activity.",
        "Data for the second quarter indicate that external demand maintains its strength.",
        "Amid the favorable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports.",
        "The Committee noted that the rebound in tourism and transportation revenues remains rather brisk, and under these circumstances, net exports will provide positive contribution to quarterly growth in the second quarter as well.",
        "In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the balancing in the domestic demand is likely to halt the upward trend in the current account deficit.",
        "However, soaring energy prices and gold imports hinder the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Domestic demand displays a more moderate course in the second quarter.",
        "Survey indicators point to a weaker consumer confidence as well as the trends of orders in firms especially producing for the domestic market.",
        "The current outlook signals for a domestic demand-driven slowdown, which is consistent with past projections that economic activity would converge to the uynderlying trend.",
        "In the close future, rising volatility in financial markets and perceptions of uncertainty, the depreciation in the Turkish lira and mounting financing costs may restrain domestic demand through investments.",
        "Meanwhile, accommodative fiscal measures are projected to moderate the slowdown in domestic demand.",

        "Risks to the global growth outlook are more on the downside for the upcoming period.",
        "Major risks that can pose a drag on global growth include geopolitical tensions and the rising protectionist sentiment in international trade.",
        "Both the US government’s decision not to exempt EU member states from the additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and political uncertainty add to the downside risks to EU growth that slowed down in the first quarter of the year.",
        "The newly passed US tax reform is poised to provide a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered a major upside risk to global growth.",
        "After the March announcement on imposing additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the US government lifted certain country exemptions from tariffs in early June, sparking possibly more protectionism in international trade across the world.",
        "In fact, impacted trading partners are poised to impose retaliatory tariffs that would spark more trade protectionism.",
        "The potential negative spillovers of such policies on global growth will depend on the size and form of the response of other trading partners.",
        "An analysis of risks to global inflation reveals that geopolitical developments coupled with uncertainties regarding trade policies are likely to pose upside risks to commodity prices, especially to energy and metal prices.",
        "Moreover, in line with the falling unemployment rates in advanced economies, the possibility of wages to increase more rapidly than current trends is among major risk factors to push up inflation.",
        "Financial conditions have recently tightened in advanced economies.",
        "The probability of an accelerated inflation due to brisk demand conditions and rising commodity prices constitutes a risk of triggering a faster-than-projected tightening in monetary policies across these countries.",
        "US bond returns have been on the rise since mid-April as the Federal Reserve (the Fed) hints at three policy rate hikes in the remainder of 2018.",
        "Amid the appreciation of the US dollar, global financial markets have recently witnessed fluctuations, the risk sentiment towards emerging economies has deteriorated, exchange rates saw depreciation and increased volatility and portfolio flows lost momentum.",
        "Fluctuating global financial markets have a tightening effect on domestic financial conditions, which led to a higher risk premium, slower portfolio flows, a weaker and more volatile Turkish lira and higher market and loan rates.",
        "Geopolitical developments and the outlook for macro indicators such as inflation and the current account deficit made Turkey more sensitive to global fluctuations.",
        "Due to higher risk premium and reduced portfolio flows, the Turkish lira faced more depreciation and volatility compared to other emerging market currencies.",
        "On the credit market front, the loan boost created by the CGF support of 2017 has largely subsided and in addition to commercial loans, there has been a balancing in consumer loans, especially in housing loans.",
        "Hence, both external and domestic developments suggest that financial conditions will remain tight over the upcoming period.",
        "After a robust first quarter, economic activity started to converge to its underlying trend in the second quarter.",
        "The uncertainty over monetary policies across advanced economies and geopolitical tensions feed into downside risks to economic activity.",
        "The recent financial market volatility and the mounting uncertainty pose downside risks to domestic demand and the growth outlook, particularly via investment spending.",
        "The tighter monetary policy stance is likely to decrease financial volatility and contain downside risks to growth.",
        "On the other hand, the strong tourism rebound, the upbeat global growth outlook and accommodative real exchange rates are expected to provide further positive contribution to the growth composition and the current account balance.",
        "The Committee emphasized that the steps toward tighter monetary policy should be accompanied by an enhanced macro policy coordination to ensure a modest rebalancing of the economy.",
        "High inflation and rising inflation expectations keep risks to pricing behavior alive.",
        "Although aggregate demand conditions are likely to have a steadily waning effect on inflation, the significant cost pressures from the recent Turkish lira depreciation and their potential second-round effects weigh on the inflation outlook.",
        "According to diffusion indices, economic agents are much more inclined to raise prices.",
        "The inertia in the indicators for underlying inflation trends and the high levels of core inflation continue to pose risks to pricing behavior.",
        "In addition, the recent increases in import prices, particularly for oil, add to these risks.",
        "Thus, considering the effects of unhealthy pricing and excessive volatilities across markets on the inflation outlook, the Central Bank introduced some adjustments for the foreign exchange market since the interim meeting on 23 May.",
        "These adjustments aim at controlled and efficient provision of the liquidity required by the market in times of excessive volatility.",
        "Accordingly, on , the Bank announced an update to the calendar for Turkish lira-settled forward foreign exchange sale auctions to be held in the second quarter of 2018, thus raising the amount of forward foreign exchange sale position from 7.1 billion USD to 8 billion USD.",
        "Moreover, the upper limit for the total amount of forward foreign exchange sale position was determined to be USD 10 billion until end-2018.",
        "Additionally, on , the Bank decided to allow repayments of rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services to be made in Turkish liras at a fixed exchange rate.",
        "Furthermore, on , the Committee announced its decision to complete the simplification process regarding the operational framework of monetary policy.",
        "Accordingly, the one-week repo rate will be the main policy rate of the Central Bank.",
        "This rate is set equal to the late liquidity window lending rate in effect on the date of meeting.",
        "In addition, the Central Bank overnight borrowing and lending rates are determined at 150 basis points below/above the one-week repo rate.",
        "Thus, the overnight borrowing and lending rates will form a symmetrical corridor around the one-week repo auction rate, keeping market rates from deviating significantly from the weekly repo auction rate.",
        "The new operational framework that took effect on is expected to enhance the predictability of monetary policy and strengthen the transmission mechanism.",
        "With the strong policy response at the interim meeting on and the simplified operational framework, the Committee has partially restrained the domestic financial market volatility.",
        "Nevertheless, the current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on pricing behavior.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to further strengthen the monetary tightening in June to support price stability and raised the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) from 16.5 percent to 17.75 percent.",
        "The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.",
        "Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.",
        "Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.",
        "Public finance has been providing more support to disinflation, which confirms the stronger coordination between monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "The joint efforts to transform policy coordination into a continuous and systematic framework will contribute to disinflation in 2018 as well.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.",
        "Moreover, sustaining structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability and social welfare."

        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1.04 points to 5.20 percent.",
        "Although annual inflation in unprocessed food increased mostly due to the prices of vegetables, seasonally-adjusted prices recorded a decline in October as in the preceding two months.",
        "Meanwhile, annual food inflation excluding fresh fruits and vegetables maintained its favorable course.",
        "Leading indicators regarding November suggest a substantial decline in annual food inflation.",
        "On the energy front, fuel prices drove annual energy inflation upwards in October to 4.71 percent, despite the reduction in natural gas prices.",
        "The rise in fuel prices is attributed to the sustained effects of the raised SCT through October as well as the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the uptrend in oil prices.",
        "Prices of services inched up by 0.35 percent, and annual services inflation fell by 0.39 points to 7.80 percent in October.",

        "Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.83 points to 6.15 percent in October.",
        "The waning cumulative effects of the exchange rate coupled with the deceleration in domestic demand drove annual inflation down in all subgroups.",
        "However, the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira confined the improvement in annual core goods inflation.",
        "The underlying trend of core goods inflation remained flat in this period.",
        "On the other hand, the underlying trend is expected to increase in the short run due to the weak course of the Turkish lira.",
        "In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the fall in inflation.",
        "However, the recent exchange rate movements resulting from increased global uncertainty and high volatility limit the improvement in inflation outlook.",
        "Recently released data indicate a deceleration in economic activity for the third quarter.",
        "The second-quarter downturn in industrial output deepened in the third quarter.",
        "Third-quarter production was principally hit by the loss of working days caused by the extended religious holidays in July and September and the incidents of July 15.",
        "Even excluding these effects, which are to be counterbalanced in the fourth quarter, underlying production was down, albeit at a slower clip.",

        "This estimation is supported by the data on mortgage and auto markets.",
        "Thanks to more accommodative monetary conditions and other newly-adopted measures, consumer loans gained modestly in recent months, buoying up the improvement projected for the final quarter.",
        "Moreover, the public sector is likely to provide an increased investment support for growth in the fourth quarter.",
        "Yet, the recent Turkish lira plunge and volatile exchange rates might weigh on private demand in the upcoming period, curbing already weak investments in particular.",

        "Domestic demand is envisaged to pick up in the upcoming period on the back of incentives stimulating domestic demand and recovering consumer loans.",
        "Given the base effect from unworked days of the third quarter, economic activity is likely to accelerate on a quarterly basis in the final quarter, producing a moderate growth for 2016.",

        "Annual inflation of durable consumption goods maintained high levels with 12 percent, and that of the clothing group hit 9.80 percent.",
        "Upward trend in core goods excluding clothing and durable goods continued.",
        "On the other hand, seasonally-adjusted indicators suggest a slowdown in the underlying trend of core goods inflation due to the dwindling effects of the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira.",
        "In sum, food and energy prices have affected inflation favorably, while other cost factors have limited the improvement in the core inflation trend recently.",
        "January industrial production increased by 1 percent month-on-month in seasonally adjusted terms, which was 1.3 percent above the previous quarter.",
        "Thus, the growth trend of 2015 was preserved in January.",
        "Survey indicators and external trade data suggest a similar pace of growth in February.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest a modest course of private demand growth in the first quarter of 2016.",

        "Survey-based indices for domestic orders also point to a continued moderate rise in domestic demand.",
        "Among indicators of investment, the production and imports of capital goods posted a small decline in January; yet the decline was mostly attributed to the vehicle industry and expected to be short-lived.",
        "The production of non-metallic minerals and the sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are indicators for construction investments, registered a drop caused partly by adverse weather conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, the consumer confidence indices and the investment sentiment reveal that the contribution of the confidence channel to domestic demand is still limited.",
        "Against this background, private demand is expected to rise modestly in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "The growing EU demand continues to support exports.",
        "Turkish exporters’ flexibility in shifting between markets contains the downside risks resulting from geopolitical tensions.",
        "Thus, amid an ongoing EU demand growth, low commodity prices and sustained macroprudential policies, the current account balance is likely to improve further.",
        "Unemployment rates were down month-on-month in December 2015, largely due to growing nonfarm employment and lower labor force participation.",
        "Across sub-sectors, the services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment also increased.",
        "Industrial employment, on the other hand, edged down for the second month in a row in December.",
        "Production and survey indicators suggest that employment growth will maintain its moderate course in the short term.",
        "Accordingly, unemployment rates are expected to remain flat in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "In conclusion, recent indicators reveal that the economy continues to grow steadily as of the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk, the EU recovery affects external demand favorably.",
        "Wage increases and low oil prices support domestic demand through the income channel.",
        "Overall, economic activity remains on a moderate growth path.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "The modest course of loans can be attributed to both supply and demand side factors.",
        "Adjustments in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to support loan growth in the forthcoming period through the loan supply and household income channels.",
        "Yet, indicators for the loan market still point to tight financial conditions, notwithstanding the recent fall in market rates and risk premiums.",
        "Therefore, loan growth rates are unlikely to post a significant recovery in the short run.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Recent data indicate that domestic demand continues to contribute to growth modestly albeit at a lesser extent compared to previous quarters.",
        "Ongoing tightness in financial conditions weighs on loan and domestic demand growth, whereas energy prices and wage developments provide support to domestic demand through the income channel.",
        "On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the economic recovery in Europe and the flexibility of exporters in shifting between markets offset this risk, which is conducive for both economic growth and rebalancing prospects.",
        "Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "On the other hand, the Committee noted that the recent developments in services exports pose downside risks on demand, employment, and the current account balance.",
        "Although this risk is not imminent at the moment, the developments should be monitored closely to have a clearer understanding of the implications for the medium-term outlook.",
        "Overall, the monetary policy stance is based on an outlook where economic activity will remain on a moderate growth path while the current account deficit will narrow further, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 bolster the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "Excessive volatility in both credit and exchange rates has been dampened after the adoption of these new instruments.",
        "In fact, the relative volatility of the Turkish lira has decreased notably since September compared to other emerging market currencies.",
        "This process is supported by the gradually falling demand for foreign exchange amid the improving current account balance and lower energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira.",
        "All these developments reduce the need for a wide interest rate corridor to some degree.",
        "Another factor that has recently reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the global economic and financial developments.",
        "Mounting prospects that global economic recovery will be slow have recently fostered the expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates across advanced economies.",
        "Accordingly, capital flows into emerging economies increased while risk premiums fell significantly.",
        "In sum, global volatility has recently waned to some extent and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map of August 2015 have reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor.",
        "In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the overnight lending rate by 25 basis points.",
        "However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.",
        "Although recent developments regarding imported input costs have eased the upside risks on the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited.",
        "Wage developments and the lagged pass-through effects of cumulative exchange rate movements restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation.",
        "Annual inflation in food prices, which declined significantly in February, is likely to post another sharp fall in March.",
        "Yet, this will be mainly due to prices of vegetables, suggesting that food prices might remain volatile in the upcoming period.",
        "Against this background, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation process is long lasting.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be undertaken in the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets.",
        "In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In March, consumer prices edged down by 0.04 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 1.32 points to 7.46 percent.",
        "As also stated in the Summary of the March MPC Meeting, this fall in inflation stemmed from unprocessed food prices.",
        "In this period, annual inflation in core indicators recorded a slight fall, while the underlying trend continued to improve on the back of the core goods group.",
        "Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 4.25 points to 4.58 percent.",
        "This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which plunged to 0.22 percent due to prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "On the processed food front, annual inflation sustained the uptrend due to the price developments in the bread-cereals group but with a diminishing pace.",
        "Meanwhile, leading indicators hint at a notable decline in unprocessed food annual inflation in April as well.",
        "On the energy front, prices rose by 0.60 percent due mainly to international oil prices, while annual inflation decreased to 1.83 percent due to the base effect.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.38 percent, and the annual services inflation receded by 0.20 point to 8.86 percent in March.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in the other services and restaurants-hotels groups, but increased in remaining subgroups.",
        "The underlying trend of services prices remained at high levels, which is attributed to high levels of inflation expectations and the pricing behavior as well as increased costs amid wage developments and cumulative exchange rate effects.",
        "Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.24 points to 10.13 percent in March.",
        "Having increased since September, the annual clothing inflation recorded a decline in this period.",
        "Owing to the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, core goods excluding clothing saw a further decline in annual inflation, albeit limited.",
        "In addition, the recent stable course of the Turkish lira led to an improvement in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.",
        "In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline.",
        "Driven mainly by the unprocessed food group, this decline is expected to continue in the short term.",
        "Despite the fall in inflation, the Committee stated that the improvement in core inflation was limited.",
        "According to the TurkStat, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by a quarterly 0.7 percent and a yearly 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "Thus, the economy grew by 4.0 percent in 2015.",
        "On the production side, the industrial value-added made the greatest contribution to quarterly growth in the last quarter.",
        "Finance and insurance activities accounted for most of the services value-added over the year.",
        "Meanwhile, the noticeable agricultural value-added growth and rise in net taxes upon the increasing production of petroleum products made a significant contribution to growth throughout the year.",
        "On the expenditure side, investment spending was the main driver of final domestic demand in quarterly terms.",
        "In this period, consumer spending slowed and external demand declined.",
        "In sum, 2015 was marked as a year with faster private consumption growth than the GDP growth, recovering capital accumulation and contracted external demand.",
        "Data for the first quarter of 2016 suggest that economic activity remains on the rise.",
        "Industrial production increased by 1.6 percent during January-February period relative to the previous quarter’s average.",
        "Given the external trade outlook and survey data for March, industrial production is expected to expand further in the first quarter.",
        "Data on spending side point to a moderate domestic demand in the first quarter.",
        "Among indicators of private consumption, the production and imports of consumer goods rose in the January-February period.",
        "Likewise, sales of automobiles, home appliances, and homes were up.",
        "On the investment side, the production of capital goods dropped whereas their imports increased.",
        "Yet, the production of nonmetallic minerals expanded while their imports receded.",
        "Sales of commercial vehicles were also down in the first quarter.",
        "Accordingly, it is assessed that private consumer spending was more robust than investments, and private consumption was the main driver of domestic demand in the first quarter.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "The growing EU demand and Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility limit downside risks caused by geopolitical developments.",
        "Thus, amid continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices, and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is expected to improve further.",
        "Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down on a month-on-month basis in January 2016, due to the increase in nonfarm employment and decline in labor supply.",
        "Across sub-sectors, services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment also increased.",
        "Industrial employment, on the other hand, was slightly down in January for the second month in a row.",
        "In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term.",
        "To sum up, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a steady and moderate pace.",
        "In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported by the income channel through wage increases and low oil prices.",
        "Although geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, the growing EU demand continues to stimulate exports.",
        "The Committee discussed the medium-term projections to be published in the April Inflation Report.",
        "In the first quarter of 2016, inflation remained below the projections of the January Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "However, inflation excluding unprocessed food and tobacco was close to the January forecast in this period.",
        "Considering the assumptions underlying the forecasts and the course of exogenous variables, inflation forecasts for the upcoming period were left unchanged from the previous report.",
        "After the January Inflation Report, the Turkish lira remained stable while oil prices inched up and import prices edged down slightly.",
        "Accordingly, the impact of TL import prices was not significant enough to lead to any change in the inflation forecasts.",
        "Despite the recently slumping unprocessed food inflation, assumptions for food inflation are preserved given high volatility in food prices.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "After slowing down in the fourth quarter of 2015, particularly for consumer loans, the growth trend of loans picked up in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Risk weight and minimum wage arrangements and improving financial conditions are likely to boost loan growth in the upcoming period via loan supply and household income channels.",
        "Thus, annual loan growth rates are expected to remain at reasonable levels.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Recent data and the leading indicators show that economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth.",
        "In the forthcoming period, domestic demand is likely to contribute more strongly to growth while the growing EU demand will further stimulate exports in spite of geopolitical risks.",
        "Strengthened investor and consumer confidence driven by reduced domestic uncertainties, recently improved financial conditions, robust post-global-crisis employment performance, and the early 2016 minimum wage hike are all expected to support domestic demand.",
        "On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments and weaker global growth continue to pose downside risks, with those to exports of services recently being on the rise.",
        "Nevertheless, the economic recovery in Europe and the market-shifting flexibility of our exports cap these downside risks.",
        "In fact, the rising EU demand has had a favorable effect on exports recently, which is conducive for both economic growth and rebalancing prospects.",
        "Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Against this background, the monetary policy stance is based on an outlook, where economic activity will remain on a moderate growth path while the current account deficit will narrow further, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 bolsters the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "The introduction of these new instruments helped to curb the excessive volatility in both exchange rates and credits.",
        "In fact, the relative volatility of the Turkish lira has decreased notably since September compared to other emerging market currencies.",
        "This process is supported by the gradually falling demand for foreign exchange amid the improving current account balance and lower energy prices.",
        "Also, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira.",
        "All these developments alleviate the need for a wide interest rate corridor.",
        "Other factors that have recently reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor are the continued decline in global volatility and the improving global financial conditions.",
        "Mounting prospects of a slow global economic recovery and the sustained monetary easing by advanced economy central banks have recently fostered the expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates across advanced economies.",
        "Accordingly, capital flows into emerging economies increased while risk premiums and market interest rates fell significantly.",
        "In sum, the recent lasting decline in global volatility and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map announced in August 2015 have reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor.",
        "Thus, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.",
        "On the other hand, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance.",
        "Although recent developments regarding imported input costs have eased the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited.",
        "The lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements, high levels of inflation expectations and wage developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation.",
        "Food inflation has recently seen a marked decline on the back of unprocessed food prices.",
        "The falling food inflation led to a decrease in consumer inflation as well, which is expected to continue in the short run.",
        "Yet, given the high volatility in unprocessed food prices, it is important to remain cautious about the inflation outlook.",
        "Hence, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation becomes permanent.",
        "In the upcoming period, monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets.",
        "In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.",
        "Notwithstanding the significant external shocks in recent years, the current policy framework limited the worsening in inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "However, price stability is yet to be achieved.",
        "Ten years of experience with inflation targeting has shown that the fight against inflation requires collaboration from all relevant parties.",
        "Therefore, bringing inflation permanently down to the 5-percent target requires all institutions to continue resolutely with the efforts made in recent years.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In January, consumer prices edged up by 1.82 percent, and annual inflation rose by 0.77 points to 9.58 percent.",
        "This rise in inflation is attributed to the products with administered prices and unprocessed food prices.",
        "The total effect of adjustments in certain products with administered prices in early January amounted to 0.7 points, as projected.",
        "Core goods inflation continued to rise, and services inflation maintained its high level.",
        "Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an increase, while their underlying trend improved slightly.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.82 points to 11.69 percent.",
        "This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices that increased due to the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "Annual inflation reached 20.09 percent in this sub-group, while that in unprocessed food hit 15.33 percent.",
        "On the processed food front, annual inflation increased to 8.41 percent amid the price developments in bread-cereals group in the last two months.",
        "Leading indicators for February suggest a downtrend in food inflation.",
        "On the energy front, prices rose by 0.81 percent due to electricity prices, and annual inflation climbed to 4.61 percent.",
        "Annual energy inflation is envisaged to fall due to developments in oil prices coupled with the base effect in February.",
        "Prices of services increased by 1.34 percent, and annual services inflation increased to 9.16 percent in January.",
        "Prices of services recorded the fastest monthly increase of the last ten years, and high increases spread across sub-groups.",
        "The gradually slowing price increases in the restaurants-hotels group amid the moderate course of meat prices in the last quarter of 2015 re-accelerated in January.",
        "In addition to wage developments and the high course of food inflation, accumulated exchange-rate pass through effects delay the fall in services inflation.",
        "Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.12 points to 10.10 percent in January.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in durable goods, but maintained its uptrend in other sub-groups.",
        "Effects of the exchange rate continued with a dwindling pace in prices of core goods excluding clothing and durable goods, while the decline in clothing prices remained below seasonal averages.",
        "On the other hand, seasonally-adjusted indicators suggest an improvement in the underlying trend of core goods inflation in January.",
        "In sum, energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "Industrial production recorded an increase in December compared to previous month.",
        "Quarterly production in the fourth quarter materialized above the third quarter.",
        "The headline PMI and the PMI production indices fell in January, despite staying above neutral levels.",
        "Business Tendency Survey data suggest that domestic orders registered an increase from the previous quarter’s average, while export orders were relatively weaker.",
        "Given these indicators as well as data on exports and imports, the pace of industrial production growth is expected to decelerate somewhat in January.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest a milder course of private demand growth in the final quarter of 2015 relative to the third quarter.",
        "In this period, the production and imports of consumer goods were down from the previous quarter’s average.",
        "Among indicators of investment, the production of capital goods posted a modest fourth-quarter growth, whereas the imports receded.",
        "The production of non-metallic minerals and sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are indicators for construction investments, registered an increase.",
        "Among indicators for the first quarter of 2016, auto sales remained subdued in January, while home appliance sales were up.",
        "Consumer confidence indices declined in January and February yet remained above the October level.",
        "Meanwhile, data on the investment tendency hint at a moderate growth.",
        "Against this background, private demand is expected to rise modestly in the first quarter of 2016.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "Despite heightened geopolitical risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports.",
        "The recovery in Europe, one of Turkey’s major export markets, continued into January.",
        "Additionally, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility also supports exports.",
        "Thus, amid a continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is likely to improve further in 2016, which, however, might be restrained by the likely fall in tourism revenues due to geopolitical developments.",
        "Unemployment rates were down month-on-month in November 2015.",
        "In this period, employment grew at a faster pace than labor force in nonfarm sectors.",

        "Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace.",
        "Although energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "Meanwhile, food prices remain volatile largely due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "Leading indicators point to a likely downward correction in unprocessed food prices in the short term.",
        "Moreover, the waning of the lagged pass-through effects of cumulative exchange rate movements might contribute to disinflation in coming months.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Committee expects the disinflation to resume by February.",
        "Yet, developments in both wages and inflation expectations pose an upside risk to the core inflation outlook.",
        "Thus, core inflation indicators are likely to remain elevated for some time.",
        "The adverse impact of the above-target inflation on inflation expectations and the acceleration in wage increases necessitates a close monitoring of the overall pricing behavior.",
        "Therefore, the current tight monetary stance should be maintained in order for the impending disinflation to be permanent.",
        "Against this backdrop, considering the impact of wage developments and the uncertainties in global markets on inflation expectations and the pricing behavior, and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",

        "Adjustments in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to support loan growth through the loan supply and household income channels.",
        "Yet, the ongoing financial tightening is likely to keep annual loan growth rates at reasonable levels.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Leading data indicate that domestic demand has slowed somewhat as of mid-2015 but continues to contribute to growth modestly.",
        "The financial tightening due to persisting global volatility dampens domestic demand growth, whereas energy prices and wage developments bolster domestic demand through the income channel.",
        "On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the European economic recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of Turkish exports offset this risk.",
        "In fact, the favorable effect of the growing EU demand on exports has become more significant recently.",

        "The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 strengthen the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "This process is supported by a gradual reduction in demand for foreign exchange due to improved current account balance and lower energy prices.",
        "Meanwhile, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira.",
        "In this context, foreign currency liquidity is provided through flexible foreign exchange sales auctions at amounts deemed necessary.",
        "Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause global markets to remain volatile.",
        "Emerging-market portfolio inflows and risk premiums follow a fluctuating pattern, while exchange rate volatilities remain elevated.",
        "In the forthcoming period, both global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and required measures in foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets will continue to be taken.",
        "In the case of sustained volatility, additional measures might be taken to support the Turkish lira by adjusting the funding conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral, while maintaining the tight monetary policy stance.",
        "In this respect, the Committee stated that the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.",
        "The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed markedly to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility.",
        "The need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in global volatility prove persistent.",
        "Another factor that may reduce the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August.",
        "Excessive fluctuations in both exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments.",
        "The Committee still maintains the view that the monetary policy may be implemented within a narrower and more standard interest rate corridor, should global volatilities post a permanent decline or the policy tools of the August road map permanently contain the effects of the global volatility on the Turkish economy.",

        "Food inflation increased somewhat due to the base effect, yet maintained its low course and continued to limit consumer inflation.",
        "In this period, annual inflation in core indicators registered a decline, while improvement in the underlying trend proved more evident.",
        "Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 1.09 points to 2.47 percent in May.",
        "The low course of food inflation was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which was -4.22 percent.",
        "In this group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels due to increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibited a mild outlook amid the measures in effect.",
        "On the other hand, processed food inflation sustained its high course due to prices of items other than meat and dairy products.",
        "Although leading indicators on June indicate that unprocessed food prices may be subject to a partial correction and the group’s annual inflation may soar, food prices are expected to support the low course in inflation across the year.",
        "On the energy front, prices rose by 1.10 percent in line with the international oil prices and depreciating Turkish lira, while annual inflation sustained the favorable outlook with 1.65 percent.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.76 percent, and the annual services inflation stood close to the previous month’s level with 8.74 percent in May.",
        "Being the culprit of high figures in services inflation, the deceleration in restaurants-hotels and other services groups in the last couple of months continued in May excluding package tour prices.",
        "The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in the restaurants-hotels group, and the attenuated cumulative effects of the exchange rate underpins the slowdown in inflation in other services.",
        "On the other hand, it is assessed that the surge in unit labor costs in the first quarter is also responsible for the high course in services inflation.",
        "Moreover, it is notable that rents soared in May as they did in April.",
        "All in all, the underlying trend of services prices remained high in May.",
        "Annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.29 points to 8.82 percent in May.",
        "Annual inflation recorded a decline in all sub-groups, and the clothing and durable goods groups stood out.",
        "Prices of durable goods registered a favorable outlook on account of the fall in white goods and flat course of automobile prices in addition to declining furniture prices following an uptrend in the first four months of the year.",
        "The underlying trend of core goods improved further, and when clothing is excluded, the improvement is still remarkable.",
        "Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.",
        "In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Core inflation indicators also recorded favorable figures, yet remained high in May.",
        "Meanwhile, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend proved more remarkable in this period.",
        "Accordingly, annual inflation in core indicators is projected to fall further in the upcoming period.",
        "However, the high inflation trend in the services group coupled with the unit labor cost developments limit disinflation.",
        "According to TurkStat data for the first quarter of 2016, GDP grew by 4.8 percent year-on-year.",
        "On the production side, industries and services made the greatest contribution to the first quarter’s annual growth.",
        "Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, GDP increased by 0.8 percent from the previous quarter.",
        "On the spending side, consumption and exports were the main drivers of quarterly growth.",
        "In this period, private consumption accelerated amid wage hikes, employment growth and improving financial conditions.",
        "Exports were buoyed by the strengthening EU recovery.",
        "Nonetheless, with imports gaining remarkably in the first quarter due to increased consumption, net exports contributed negatively to quarterly growth.",
        "In short, growth was driven largely by consumption and supported somewhat by exports in the first quarter, yet capital accumulation remained moderate.",
        "Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate no additional acceleration for economic activity.",
        "Industrial production dropped by 1.1 percent month-on-month in April on the back of mining, vehicle, furniture and computer industries.",
        "May’s PMI indicators and BTS indicators for orders over the last three months performed slightly better than in April, suggesting some correction in industrial production for May.",

        "Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down in March for the second consecutive month.",
        "The strengthening non-farm employment growth pulled unemployment rates down despite the increased labor force participation.",
        "Industrial employment saw a moderate gain, while construction and services employment expanded significantly.",
        "Failing to spread across all sectors, the employment growth in services was driven mostly by public administration and community services.",
        "In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term.",
        "Yet, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism industry has started to affect employment.",
        "Thus, the unemployment rate continues to face upside risks for the period ahead.",

        "Employment remains on a moderate upward path.",
        "Given wage developments, employment growth is likely to support domestic demand further through the income channel.",
        "On the external demand side, geopolitical tensions and the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, while risks to the tourism industry became prevalent.",
        "However, the robust increase in Turkey’s exports to the EU and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to external balance.",
        "Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Global financial markets remain volatile amid ongoing concerns over global growth, developments regarding UK's exit from the EU and continued uncertainty about global monetary policies.",

        "Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.",
        "Moreover, within the context of the road map, related departments made presentations about the arrangements that would increase the predictability of liquidity policy and make liquidity management of banks more efficient.",

        "In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In December, consumer prices edged up by 0.21 percent, and annual inflation rose by 0.71 points to 8.81 percent.",
        "This rise in inflation is attributed to the increase in unprocessed food prices and the base effect in energy prices.",
        "Core goods inflation continued to rise, and services inflation maintained its high level.",
        "Thus, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an increase, while its underlying trend improved slightly.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1.35 points to 10.87 percent.",
        "This was driven by the rising prices of vegetables, and the annual rate of price increases reached 23.32 percent in this sub-group.",
        "Thus, unprocessed food inflation climbed to 13.83 percent, maintaining its high course of the last two years.",
        "On the processed food front, annual inflation increased to 8.33 percent due particularly to the price developments in oils and bread-cereals groups.",
        "Leading indicators for January suggest a persisting high course in food inflation.",
        "On the energy front, despite a monthly decline by 0.22 percent in prices, annual inflation climbed to 2.96 percent due to the base effect in December.",
        "In January, the fall in oil prices notwithstanding, energy inflation is expected to increase further owing both to the low base in 2015 and the adjustment in electricity prices.",
        "In addition to the adjustment in electricity prices, adjustments introduced to some items with administered prices like tobacco and alcoholic drinks in early January will have a direct effect on inflation close to 0.7 point.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.22 percent, and annual services inflation slightly increased to 8.85 percent in the last month of the year.",
        "Thus, prices of services claimed the highest year-end increase since 2008.",
        "Food prices affected services inflation adversely through the catering services channel across the year, leading the restaurants-hotels group to register the highest increase, 13.23 percent, within the sub-groups.",
        "Meanwhile, the cumulative depreciation in the exchange rate coupled with the course of the headline inflation and the effects of wage developments stood out as other factors for the high course of services inflation.",
        "On the other hand, slowing oil prices curbed services inflation through transport services.",
        "Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.61 points to 10.22 percent in December.",
        "Annual inflation followed a flat course in durable goods, but recorded increases in other sub-groups.",
        "The cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core goods, albeit with some slowdown.",
        "Clothing inflation remained on the rise, and annual inflation in this group rose by around 4.7 points to 9 percent in the last three-month-period.",
        "Seasonally-adjusted data indicated a decrease in the underlying trend of core goods inflation in December.",
        "In sum, international energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably.",
        "On the other hand, other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "Industrial production recorded a month-on-month decline in November, yet the October-November average of the index stood above the third-quarter level.",
        "Among the BTS order indicators of the last three months, the domestic market orders registered a recovery, while the export orders declined.",
        "The Headline PMI and PMI production indices recorded an increase in December, following the increase in November, and remained above the stationary level.",
        "Despite the decline in December, consumer confidence indices stood above the level in October.",
        "The investor confidence also increased moderately in December.",
        "Against this background, industrial production is expected to register an increase on a monthly basis in December.",
        "Data on the expenditure side suggest a milder course of private demand growth in the last quarter of 2015 relative to the third quarter.",
        "In the October-November period, production and imports of consumption goods registered a decline compared to the average of the previous quarter.",
        "Sales of white goods and automobiles trended downwards as well.",
        "Among indicators of investment, production of capital goods increased further in the October-November period, yet the imports receded.",
        "Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products and sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are among the indicators for construction investment, registered a decline.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets.",
        "The trend of recovery in the European economy, which is a significant trading partner of Turkey, continued in the last quarter of 2015.",
        "In addition to the recovery trend in the Euro area, high market-shifting flexibility supports exports.",
        "Accordingly, improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue with the support of increased demand from the EU countries, low course of commodity prices, and ongoing macroprudential policy measures.",
        "In October 2015, unemployment rates registered a month-on-month increase.",
        "Labor force in non-farm sectors grew more than employment in this period.",
        "Industrial employment increased, while construction employment remained unchanged.",
        "Services employment, on the other hand, displayed a slight decline.",
        "Industrial production and survey indicators signal an increase in employment in the upcoming period.",
        "Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products hints at no additional revival in the construction sector.",
        "In the services sector, employment data in sub-sectors follow a fluctuating course.",
        "Accordingly, unemployment rates in the last quarter are expected to remain close to those of the third quarter.",
        "To sum up, recent indicators suggest that growth in economic activity will continue in the last quarter of 2015, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Despite the downside risk due to geopolitical developments, the recovery in the European economies continues to positively contribute to external demand.",
        "In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported by the income channel through wage increases and the low course of oil prices, and by the confidence channel through waning domestic uncertainties.",
        "Hence, growth in economic activity is expected to continue.",
        "The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) discussed the medium-term projections to be published in the January Inflation Report.",
        "Inflation in the last quarter of 2015 exceeded the projections of the October Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "However, inflation excluding unprocessed food and tobacco was close to the October forecast in this period.",
        "Core inflation remained high due to the lagged effects of the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira, yet the ongoing fall in import prices in the fourth quarter limited the rise in CPI inflation.",
        "Evaluating assumptions underlying the inflation forecasts and the course of exogenous variables, an upward revision was made to the end-2016 inflation forecast, in consideration of the effects of the revisions in the Turkish lira-denominated import and oil prices, administered price adjustments announced in January and minimum wage arrangements.",
        "Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.",
        "Food prices remain volatile due mainly to the unprocessed food group.",
        "Lagged effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira are evident particularly on the core goods inflation.",
        "Moreover, as the minimum-wage adjustment passes through to overall wages, cost and demand pressures on inflation stemming from wages are likely to increase in the upcoming period.",
        "Accordingly, core inflation indicators are expected to remain high for a while.",
        "The effect of the above-target inflation on expectations and the acceleration in wage increases require the pricing behavior regarding the overall economy to be monitored closely.",
        "In this respect, considering the impact of wage developments and the uncertainties in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior, and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.",
        "Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "The recent growth trend of loans reveals that both consumer and commercial loans remained below historical averages; consumer loans throughout 2015, commercial loans only in the second half of the year.",
        "Recent arrangements in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to boost loan growth through the loan supply and household income channels.",
        "On the other hand, the ongoing tightness in financial conditions is likely to keep the annual loan growth rates at reasonable levels.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "In the upcoming period, it is envisaged that the domestic demand will provide a slightly larger contribution to growth and the rising demand from the European Union countries will continue to improve exports.",
        "The recovery in the investor and consumer confidence led by waning domestic uncertainties, the room for spending amid the fall in oil prices and the effects of the recent wage developments on the purchasing power are projected to boost domestic demand.",
        "Persisting global volatilities and the tightness in financial conditions stand out as the factors that limit the domestic demand increase.",
        "On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the trend of rebound in the European economy coupled with the market-shifting flexibility of our exports cap this risk.",
        "In fact, exports towards the European Union countries have recently recorded a remarkable acceleration.",
        "Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the sharp fall in commodity prices, accompanied by the sluggish course of consumer loans support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Accordingly, the current account deficit is expected to decline further in the upcoming period.",
        "Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause financial markets to remain volatile.",
        "Thus, portfolio flows to emerging economies and risk indicators follow a highly volatile pattern.",
        "Exchange rates also display a quite fluctuating course.",
        "The Committee believes that the policy tools placed in the road map announced in August 2015 strengthen the resilience of the economy against global shocks.",
        "In the upcoming period, both global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and required measures will continue to be taken.",
        "In this context, related departments presented information to the Committee on the foreign exchange liquidity instruments and methods that have been used since and that may be used in the upcoming periods and their effects.",
        "In case the decline in loan growth rates becomes permanent and exchange rates continue to face upward pressure, the Committee, while preserving the tight monetary policy stance, may take measures to support the Turkish lira and loan growth by reconsidering the funding conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral.",
        "In this respect, the Committee stated that the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.",
        "The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility.",
        "The need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in global volatility prove persistent.",
        "Another factor reducing the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective use of policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August.",
        "Excessive fluctuations both in exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments.",
        "The Committee’s assessment still prevails that the monetary policy may be implemented within a narrower and more standard interest rate corridor, should global volatilities see a permanent decline or the policy tools specified in the August road map permanently cap the effects of the global volatility on the Turkish economy.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant.",
        "Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In August, consumer prices decreased by 0.29 percent, and annual consumer inflation went down by 0.74 points to 8.05 percent.",
        "As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of August, this fall was driven by the correction in the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Prices of tobacco products, on the other hand, manifested the dragged effect of the July correction in August.",
        "In this period, core indicators saw a decline in annual inflation, but a slight increase in underlying trends driven by core goods.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages tumbled down to 6.19 percent due mainly to the decline in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables has exhibited a favorable course lately.",
        "Leading indicators regarding September hint at a prolonged downward correction in unprocessed food inflation.",
        "On the energy front, prices declined on account of the falling fuel prices.",
        "Annual energy inflation climbed to 2.97 percent due to the base effect.",
        "In September, lump-sum SCT applied to fuel products was raised, which is expected to have direct effect on consumer inflation by 0.3 points.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.71 percent, and the annual services inflation fell by 0.46 points to 8.09 percent in August.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in all sub-groups except rents in this period.",
        "The fall in annual inflation was driven by the favorable course of food prices in addition to the inflation in the prices of restaurant-hotel services that lost pace due to the base effect.",
        "The surge in unit labor costs in the first half of the year played a significant role in the high course of services inflation, while the slowdown in the tourism sector restricts these effects to some extent.",
        "In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibits a limited deceleration.",
        "Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.15 points to 8.67 percent in August.",
        "Annual inflation crept up in durable goods, but decreased in other groups.",
        "Lagged effects of the exchange rate on annual core goods inflation display a gradual decline.",
        "However, following the July depreciation in the Turkish lira, the underlying trend in core goods exhibited a slight increase in this period.",
        "In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation.",
        "With the help of falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to display a decline in the short term.",
        "However, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation.",
        "Second-quarter TurkStat data indicate that the GDP grew by an annual 3.1 percent.",
        "Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, growth has lost some momentum in the second quarter, up only by 0.3 percent after seeing a modest 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter.",
        "Investments remained sluggish while private and public spending provided a major boost to growth.",
        "The spillovers of the tourism slump became more pervasive in the second quarter, causing net exports to have a heightened negative impact on growth.",
        "Recent data releases and indicators for the third quarter point to a deceleration in economic activity.",
        "Calendar and seasonally-adjusted industrial production dipped both monthly and annually due to the domestic turbulence of July and the extended Ramadan holiday.",
        "This plunge is in part attributed to both the loss of working days caused by this holiday extension (bridge-day effects) and the drop in effective working days following July 15.",
        "In fact, recent indicators suggest that the recovery in August and September partly compensated for July’s output loss.",
        "Nevertheless, third-quarter industrial production is expected to be lower than in the second quarter.",
        "The increased EU demand continues to foster exports.",
        "Despite geopolitically-driven negative effects on external demand, Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification remains supportive of exports.",
        "Recent data on external trade signal that non-gold exports were up in August, offsetting the July descent.",
        "Yet, spillovers from the troubled tourism industry into net exports were more pronounced in the summer months.",
        "The tourism slump is likely to have a short-lived negative impact on the current account balance, but the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans help to improve the current account balance.",
        "Meanwhile, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the coming months.",
        "In June, seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were up month-on-month due to narrowing non-farm employment.",
        "Thus, with the deteriorating employment outlook, unemployment rates jumped for the second month in a row.",
        "The employment decline spread across all industries.",
        "Industrial and construction employment dropped while services employment saw a weakening growth.",
        "In light of actual data and leading indicators, unemployment rates are anticipated to surge in the third quarter.",
        "Moreover, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism industry continues to weigh on services employment as of June.",
        "In sum, economic activity is expected to post a quarterly fall in the third quarter.",
        "However, it is envisaged that the negative impact of the downturn in tourism on growth will be more restricted and domestic demand will start to recover on the back of accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "The Committee assesses that current financial conditions are tight.",
        "The rise in global risk appetite helps to ease financial conditions, but loan standards remain tight.",
        "The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate partly passed through into loan and deposit rates.",
        "Loans are likely to see a moderate recovery over the upcoming period with the support coming from accommodative macroprudential measures.",
        "Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity.",
        "Unemployment rates which have been on the rise for the second consecutive month due to the worsening employment outlook confirm the economic slowdown.",
        "However, leading indicators imply that the significant slowdown in industrial production observed in July is not permanent.",
        "Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to EU members remain strong.",
        "Restored relations with Russia may also support external demand gradually.",
        "Accordingly, exports of goods are expected to provide further contributions to growth in the upcoming period.",
        "Domestic demand is likely to start recovering by the fourth quarter on account of accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "In terms of global economic developments, low levels of advanced economy interest rates and commodity prices continue to affect the Turkish economy favorably.",
        "Although the uncertainty over global monetary policies have somewhat heightened, emerging economies continue to attract portfolio inflows.",
        "In light of these developments and considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and prudent step towards simplification.",
        "The ultimate aim of simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate.",
        "The simplification of the monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule.",
        "The pace and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.",
        "Inflation was down in August owing to improving indicators for unprocessed food and core inflation.",
        "The lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements on annual inflation eased further.",
        "However, the implications of the Turkish lira’s July depreciation for core goods and the pressures from unit labor costs and rigidities on services caused the underlying core inflation to remain high.",
        "In spite of gains from lower imported-input costs, the underlying inflation improved only marginally.",
        "For the upcoming period, the slowing aggregate demand may contribute to the gradual decline in core inflation while falling food prices are expected to pull inflation down in the short term.",
        "Nevertheless, adjustments in fuel taxes and other cost-related developments put upward pressure on inflation and require the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance.",
        "In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "Sustained fiscal discipline has become essential in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant.",
        "Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In November, consumer prices went up by 0.52 percent, while annual consumer inflation fell by 0.16 points to 7.0 percent.",
        "As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of November, annual food inflation receded considerably, while energy inflation increased due to the depreciation in the Turkish lira.",
        "On the other hand, the effect of recent exchange rate movements on core inflation indicators remained relatively limited due to the slowdown in aggregate demand.",
        "Thus, the underlying trends of core indicators displayed a practically flat course.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.65 points to 3.55 percent, which was led by the falling unprocessed food prices due to the decline in the prices of vegetables.",
        "Annual processed food inflation remained on the decline.",
        "Leading indicators regarding December suggest an uptick in annual food inflation on account of the unprocessed food inflation.",
        "Energy prices increased by 1.05 points in November and the depreciation in the Turkish lira resulted in overall price hikes in the sector.",
        "Thus, annual energy inflation rose by 1.44 points to 6.15 percent.",
        "This rise is expected to continue in December due to the uptrend in the exchange rate coupled with oil prices.",
        "In addition to food and energy groups, recent tax adjustments introduced to some items, chiefly tobacco products, is envisaged to put a noticeable upside pressure on December inflation.",
        "Prices of services recorded an uptick by 0.29 percent, and annual services inflation crept up by 0.14 points to 7.94 percent in November.",
        "Annual inflation decreased in transport and rent, but increased in other sub-groups in this period.",
        "Consequences of the slowdown in domestic demand and the tourism sector were evident in the prices of services, while some groups reflected the effect of depreciation of the Turkish lira as well.",
        "In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation registered a slight increase.",
        "Annual core goods inflation inched down by 0.22 points to 5.92 percent in November.",
        "Inflation plummeted in the clothing group, but increased in durable goods.",
        "Recent exchange rate developments had a limited effect on durable goods in November.",
        "This month was marked by a notable depreciation in the Turkish lira, while aggregate demand conditions confined the deterioration in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.",
        "In sum, the effect of the recent rise in exchange rate and oil prices on inflation remained relatively limited due to aggregate demand conditions.",
        "The GDP narrowed by 1.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter and grew by 2.2 percent through the first nine months of 2016.",
        "The Committee assessed that the underlying growth of economic activity is not as slow as third-quarter GDP data suggest.",
        "In fact, mid-July incidents and the loss of working days caused by extended religious holidays had far more implications than normal calendar effects.",
        "Adjusted for such effects, the economy is estimated to register a year-on-year expansion rather than a contraction in the third quarter.",
        "In the third quarter, value-added was up in construction but down in agriculture, industry and services on a yearly basis.",
        "On the spending front, public consumption provided further support to growth.",
        "Meanwhile, construction investments contributed to annual growth positively whereas machinery and equipment investments and private spending declined.",
        "Domestic demand continued to prop up growth, albeit to a lesser extent, while the effects of the tourism slump became more pronounced and net exports provided an increased negative contribution to growth.",
        "Recent data indicate that economic activity rebounded somewhat in the fourth quarter after the third-quarter deceleration.",
        "With working day losses led by extended religious holidays counterbalanced and the underlying trend on a modest upward track, industrial output increased in October.",
        "Data on the production and exports of electricity and vehicles point to further growth in industrial output for November.",
        "Thus, industrial production is likely to post a quarterly gain in the fourth quarter thanks to the base effect from unworked days.",
        "However, apart from the very much technical recovery driven by working day effects, the economy recovery seems to be a moderate one yet to spread across all sectors.",
        "Economic activity is expected to recover further amid accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "This estimation is supported by the data on mortgage and auto markets.",
        "Thanks to more accommodative monetary conditions and other newly-adopted measures, consumer loans have picked up in recent months, bolstering the prospects for a gradual improvement.",
        "Moreover, the public sector is expected to provide further investment support to growth in the coming months.",
        "The growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in particular.",
        "Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand.",
        "Furthermore, the newly-restored relations with Russia translated into a boost for exports.",
        "The gloomy tourism industry continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of loans.",
        "However, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the upcoming period.",
        "The labor market decline that began in May paused in September amid rising nonfarm employment.",
        "The growth in nonfarm employment was mostly driven by the increased construction employment.",
        "Meanwhile, services and industrial employment picked up only modestly.",
        "Leading indicators such as new job vacancies and unemployment insurance claims suggest that employment remains subdued and unemployment rates will remain at high levels.",
        "In sum, economic activity edged up in the fourth quarter and is expected to record a moderate growth in 2016.",
        "However, the potential impact of recent global and geopolitical developments on financial conditions and the lack of any signs of a rosy tourism outlook remain a downside risk to the pace of economic recovery.",
        "Consumer loans continue to improve amid falling interest rates and macroprudential measures.",
        "Nevertheless, due to global and geopolitical spillovers into domestic financial markets, commercial loans remain weak.",
        "Measures taken by the Economic Coordination Committee to uplift the real sector are expected to help commercial loans increase in the upcoming period.",
        "The ongoing uncertainty over global monetary policies and enhanced Fed rate hike prospects lead to financial market volatility and portfolio outflows in emerging economies.",
        "To counteract their negative spillovers into exchange rates and lending standards, the CBRT maintains a stabilizing stance for FX liquidity and a supportive macroprudential policy stance.",
        "Domestic demand is expected to start recovering by the fourth quarter amid accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "Yet, global market turmoil and geopolitical risks keep a firm lid on the pace of economic recovery.",
        "Thus, economic activity is likely to grow moderately in the upcoming period.",

        "The Committee stated that adopting structural reforms might boost the economy’s growth potential to a large extent.",
        "Exchange rate movements and rising oil prices fueled by the recently heightened global uncertainty pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook.",
        "Recent price movements and current weather forecasts add to the upside risks to food prices for the coming months, which, however, are curbed by aggregate demand.",
        "The Committee agreed that future developments should be closely monitored to determine the net effects of these factors on the inflation outlook for 2017.",
        "Against this background, the Committee kept the marginal funding rate constant in December and maintains its position that the simplification should be completed within an appropriate time frame.",
        "The gains that were planned through simplification are performing to a great extent.",
        "The direction and the timing of the next step toward simplification will depend on the developments in inflation and financial stability.",

        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "In the current environment of high global uncertainty, it is critical to maintain and further enhance these achievements.",
        "Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and to reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping the interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In July, consumer prices increased by 1.16 percent, and annual inflation went up by 1.15 points to 8.79 percent.",
        "As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of July, this rise was driven by prices of unprocessed food and tobacco products.",
        "Both annual inflation figures and the underlying trends of core indicators followed a flat course in this period.",
        "Having surged in the last two months, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages climbed to 9.69 percent due to the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "However, annual inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables registered a decline.",
        "Agricultural prices also displayed a similar path, indicating that the rise in food inflation in this period stemmed from producer prices.",
        "On the other hand, leading indicators regarding August point out a downward correction in unprocessed food prices.",
        "On the energy front, prices fell by 0.40 percent on account of the decline in international oil prices.",
        "Thus, annual energy inflation maintained a low course with 2.40 percent.",
        "Prices of services increased by 1.07 percent, and the annual services inflation rose by 0.30 points to 8.55 percent in July.",
        "Annual inflation increased in transport and communication services, but remained almost unchanged in other sub-groups in this period.",
        "Restaurants and hotels group also exhibited a high monthly rise in line with the high course of food inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the monthly rate of increase in rents, which had been high for a while, slowed somewhat in July.",
        "As a result, the underlying trend of services recorded an increase in July.",
        "The surge in unit labor costs in the first quarter coupled with increased rigidities due to the prolonged high course of consumer inflation weigh on services inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the recent deceleration in economic activity may curb services inflation.",
        "Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.31 points to 8.82 percent in July, driven by durable goods.",
        "Prices of durable goods excluding furniture displayed a favorable outlook.",
        "Upon the lingering labor-driven cost pressures since the start of the year, cumulative price increases in the furniture group amounted to 8 percent in the first 7 months.",
        "The underlying core goods inflation posted a decline in July.",
        "However, the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira is expected to deteriorate the core goods inflation to some extent in the short term.",
        "Nevertheless, waning cumulative exchange rate effects are likely to pull annual core goods inflation further down in the upcoming period.",
        "In sum, consumer inflation surged in the last two months owing to the unprocessed food prices.",
        "In addition, tobacco products saw price hikes in July as well.",
        "The impact of this rise will be seen also in August, albeit to a relatively limited extent.",

        "Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index decreased by 1.4 percent in June compared to May.",
        "Thus, following a robust quarterly increase of 1.4 percent in the first quarter, production declined by 0.6 percent in the second quarter.",
        "Despite the favorable figures in exports excluding gold, negative contribution of net exports to growth continued amid the rise in import demand coupled with the growing loss in tourism revenues.",
        "Data on the expenditure side point to a modest course in final domestic demand in the second quarter.",
        "The production of consumer goods posted a decline on a quarterly basis, while that of investment goods remained flat.",

        "Data regarding the third quarter indicate that the private sector demand may weaken compared to the first half of the year.",
        "In fact, July witnessed decreases in sales of automobiles, white goods and light commercial vehicles.",
        "Meanwhile, the new job posts and the PMI employment data also confirmed the signs of deceleration.",
        "Although developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",

        "In this period, non-farm employment growth posted a slowdown, pushing unemployment rates upwards.",

        "The data from the Social Security Institution indicate that the stagnant tourism sector started to have spillovers on employment.",
        "Leading indicators signal a deceleration in employment growth in the short term.",
        "To sum up, economic activity continues to grow at a moderate and stable pace.",
        "Domestic developments of July may cause a pause in this trend in the short term.",
        "However, this is not likely to be a permanent trend, as the recent measures contained the adverse impacts on the markets.",
        "On the other hand, the reduction in tourism revenues is expected to curtail the improvement in the current account balance, rise in employment and growth.",
        "Financial conditions remain tight, while the moderate course of annual loan growth rates continue.",
        "Despite the recent rise in global risk appetite and capital inflows, the improvement in financial conditions is detained due to domestic developments.",
        "The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate spilled over into loan and deposit rates remarkably, yet loan-deposit spreads remain high, and loan standards exercised by banks have not eased.",
        "Moreover, the moderate course of final domestic demand also restricts loan growth.",
        "Given the demand and supply-side factors no noticeable rebound is envisaged in loan growth rates in the short term.",
        "Economic activity maintains a moderate and stable course of growth.",
        "Consumption spending has slowed down slightly, while investment remains relatively sluggish.",
        "Meanwhile, the steady increase in employment and wage developments support domestic demand through the income channel.",
        "Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to the European Union countries remain strong.",
        "Restored relations with Russia may also support external demand gradually.",
        "Accordingly, exports of goods are expected to provide further contributions to growth in the upcoming period.",
        "In this respect, economic activity is expected to show a moderate pace of growth across the year.",
        "Domestic developments in July, geopolitical factors, waning global growth and sluggish tourism sector pose a downside risk to economic activity.",
        "On the other hand, domestic confidence indices have not shown a sharp deterioration.",
        "This, together with the market-shifting flexibility of our exports put a limit on the downside risks.",
        "The volatility in global financial markets has recently eased, and portfolio inflows to emerging markets gained momentum amid the increased risk appetite.",
        "The consequences of the mid-July turmoil in Turkey on financial markets were largely taken back thanks to the rise in the global risk appetite and the liquidity measures.",
        "The tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policy and the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against external shocks.",
        "Accordingly, the Committee decided to take one more measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.",
        "The ultimate aim of simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate.",

        "Lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements eased further, underpinning the improvement in core goods inflation.",
        "However, pressures led by unit labor costs and food prices caused the underlying trend of the services inflation to remain high.",
        "In spite of the support from the low level of imported input costs, the improvement in the inflation trend has been limited.",
        "Growing signals for deceleration in domestic demand stemming from the latest domestic developments and the poor outlook in the tourism sector constitute downside risks to demand and inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, exchange rate movements and possible public price/tax adjustments keep the upside risks to inflation brisk.",
        "In this respect, developments regarding the inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance.",
        "In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",

        "Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 3.20 points to 1.38 percent.",
        "The deceleration in food inflation was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which plunged to -5.94 percent.",
        "In this group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels due to increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibit a mild outlook amid the measures in effect.",
        "On the other hand, processed food inflation sustained its high course also due to prices in the bread-cereals group.",
        "On the energy front, prices rose by 0.34 percent in line with international oil prices, while annual inflation sustained the mild outlook with 1.74 percent.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.64 percent, and the annual services inflation edged down by 0.10 point to 8.76 percent in April.",
        "Being the culprit of high figures in services inflation, the restaurants-hotels and other services groups lost pace in the last couple of months.",
        "The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in the restaurants-hotels group, and the attenuated cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira underpins the slowdown in inflation in other services.",
        "On the other hand, inflation in transport services continued with an uptrend and rent inflation rose to 8.39 percent.",
        "All in all, despite some deceleration, the underlying trend of services prices remained high.",

        "Annual inflation recorded an increase in the clothing group, but edged down in others.",
        "Prices of durable goods registered a modest monthly increase by 0.43 percent, yet the uptrend in subgroups like furniture and white goods proved notable.",

        "Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.",
        "In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Despite the fall in inflation, the Committee stated that the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited.",
        "Data for the first quarter of 2016 suggest that economic activity remains on the rise.",
        "Up by 1.5 percent from the previous quarter’s average, industrial production recorded the largest increase since the first quarter of 2014.",
        "Production of basic pharmaceuticals made the greatest contribution to quarterly growth, while main industries such as food, clothing and textiles also contributed to growth, which is a favorable development.",
        "In addition, the steady increase in the exports to the EU is another factor supporting industrial production growth.",
        "Data on spending side point to a rising domestic demand for the first quarter.",
        "Among indicators of private consumption, the production and imports of consumer goods grew robustly.",
        "Likewise, sales of automobiles, home appliances and homes were up in the first quarter.",
        "On the investment side, the production of capital goods dropped whereas their imports increased.",
        "The production of capital goods declined due to vehicle manufacturing, yet vehicles excluded, it posted a rise.",
        "Moreover, both the warmer-than-normal weather in winter months and the upsurge in the production and imports of nonmetallic minerals suggest some increase in construction activities for the first quarter.",
        "Against this background, it is assessed that private consumer spending was more robust than investments, and private consumption was the main driver of domestic demand in the first quarter.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "The growing EU demand continues to support exports.",
        "High market-shifting flexibility of exports limits downside risks caused by geopolitical developments.",
        "Thus, amid continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is expected to improve further.",
        "Yet, the falling number of foreign visitors weighs on revenues from services, posing a downside risk to the current account deficit.",
        "Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down month-on-month in February 2016, due to the weakening labor supply and the moderate gain in nonfarm employment.",
        "Across sub-sectors, services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment continued to expand.",
        "Meanwhile, industrial employment continued to drop slightly in February.",
        "In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term.",
        "This labor market outlook is likely to spur growth in 2016.",
        "In sum, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace.",
        "In the upcoming period, the income channel is likely to push domestic demand higher through wage increases and a food price-driven decline in headline inflation.",
        "Although geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports, and thus production.",
        "Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.",
        "Risk weight and minimum wage arrangements are expected to boost loan growth further in the upcoming period via loan supply and household income channels.",
        "Thus, annual loan growth rates are likely to remain at reasonable levels.",
        "With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans.",
        "This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Economic activity remains on a moderate and steady growth track.",
        "In the first quarter, industrial production recorded a robust quarter-on-quarter increase while external demand supported growth.",
        "In the forthcoming period, domestic demand is expected to provide further support to growth while the rising EU demand will continue to promote exports.",
        "Employment remained on a moderate upward path in the first quarter.",
        "Given wage developments, employment growth is likely to support domestic demand further through the income channel.",
        "On the external demand side, geopolitical tensions and the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, and risks to services exports became prevalent.",
        "However, the European economic recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to external balance.",
        "Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent amid ongoing concerns over global growth and continued uncertainty about global monetary policies.",
        "Accordingly, emerging-market portfolio flows slowed slightly while risk premiums and exchange rate volatilities recorded increases.",
        "The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against shocks.",
        "These policy measures have tamed the heightened volatility in both exchange rates and loans.",
        "In fact, the Turkish lira has followed a relatively less volatile path than other emerging market currencies since September 2015.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.",
        "Moreover, within the context of the road map, related departments made presentations about the arrangements that would increase the predictability of liquidity policy and make liquidity management of banks more efficient.",
        "On the other hand, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance.",
        "Although low imported-input costs have eased the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited.",
        "The weakening yet ongoing lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements, high levels of inflation expectations and wage developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation.",
        "Food inflation has recently seen a marked decline on the back of unprocessed food prices.",
        "The falling food inflation led to a decrease in consumer inflation as well.",
        "Yet, given the elevated core inflation, it is important to remain cautious about the inflation outlook.",
        "To this end, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation becomes permanent.",
        "In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook.",
        "Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.",
        "Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets.",
        "In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",

        "As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of September, being driven by unprocessed food prices, the deceleration in food inflation continued.",
        "Moreover, weakening demand conditions also supported the disinflation process.",
        "On the other hand, the tax rise in fuel products curbed the improvement in inflation through direct and indirect effects.",
        "Core indicators’ annual inflation declined while their underlying trends somewhat improved in this period.",
        "Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages decreased by 2.03 points to 4.16 percent due mainly to the decline in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables maintained its favorable course.",
        "Leading indicators regarding October suggest some increase in food inflation.",
        "On the energy front, prices increased on account of rising taxes on fuel products.",
        "Annual energy inflation climbed to 4.56 percent.",
        "Recent developments in the exchange rate and international oil prices are envisaged to push October energy inflation upwards, yet this adverse effect is likely to be partly offset by the reduction in natural gas prices at the start of the month.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.89 percent, and annual services inflation inched up by 0.11 points to 8.19 percent in September.",
        "Annual inflation increased in transport services; remained flat in rent, and decreased in other sub-groups in this period.",
        "Inflation in the restaurant-hotel group decelerated further due to the favorable course of food prices stemming from the contraction in tourism, whereas prices of transport services witnessed an upsurge amid fuel price hikes.",
        "In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibited an uptick.",
        "Annual core goods inflation fell by 1.70 points to 6.97 percent in September.",
        "Being more evident in durable goods, annual inflation decreased in all subgroups.",
        "The fall in core goods inflation is attributed to the waning cumulative effects of the exchange rate coupled with the deceleration in domestic demand.",
        "Accordingly, the underlying trend in core goods exhibited a remarkable slowdown in this period.",
        "In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation.",
        "However, exchange rate developments and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation outlook.",
        "Recent data releases and indicators for the third quarter point to deceleration in economic activity.",
        "The second-quarter plunge in industrial production has deepened due to the sharp drop in July.",
        "This output fall in July is largely attributed to the demand-side effects of the domestic turbulence as well as to the loss of working days caused by the Ramadan holiday and the incidents of July 15.",
        "In fact, industrial production recovered by a rapid 9.4 percent month-on-month in August, confirming that July’s output loss was not a good indicator of the underlying trend.",
        "Both PMI indicators for new orders and output and the manufacturing industry capacity utilization rate edged upward in September.",
        "Notwithstanding the upbeat outlook suggested by survey indicators, production may see a renewed slowdown due to bridge-day effects caused by the extended holiday for the Sacrifice Feast in September, leading to a quarter-on-quarter decline in industrial production in the third quarter.",
        "Domestic demand is expected to pick up by the fourth quarter amid accommodative incentives and measures.",
        "July’s domestic tensions dampened final domestic demand to a great extent through both consumer and investment spending.",
        "In the July-August period, the production and imports of consumer goods and the consumption of durable goods were markedly down from the second quarter.",
        "On the investment front, data on the production and imports of machinery and equipment showed that investments remained weak over the third quarter.",
        "An indicator for construction activity, the production and imports of nonmetallic minerals declined, suggesting that construction investments slowed in the third quarter.",
        "Recent data signal that domestic demand started to rebound in the fourth quarter.",

        "Growing EU demand continued to bolster exports.",
        "Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand.",
        "Yet, recent data show that exports and imports of goods were largely affected by the July turbulence.",
        "Despite some recovery in August and September, trade of goods declined in the third quarter.",
        "Spillovers from the troubled tourism industry into net exports were more pronounced in the summer months.",
        "The tourism slump continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is somewhat alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans.",
        "However, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the coming months.",
        "The deteriorating labor market outlook of May and June continued into July due to falling industrial employment, causing unemployment rates to remain on the rise.",
        "Employment gains in services lost more pace amid sluggish economic activity.",
        "Across non-farm industries, the previous quarter’s decline in construction employment came to a halt.",
        "Additionally, according to the SSI data on registered employees, the employment fall in major tourism industries (accommodation, travel agents and tour operators) turned around in July.",
        "Moreover, the PMI for industrial employment signals no additional deterioration for September yet remains low.",
        "Given the weak economic activity and leading indicators for employment, unemployment rates are expected to climb further in the third quarter.",
        "In sum, economic activity is expected to recede in the third quarter.",
        "However, domestic demand is envisaged to pick up in the upcoming period on the back of less uncertainty, restored producer and consumer confidence, incentives stimulating domestic demand and recovering consumer loans.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be published in the October Inflation Report.",
        "In the third quarter of the year, inflation recorded a decline on account of the improvements in unprocessed food and core inflation indicators.",
        "While the lagged effects of the cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation continued to wane, slowing aggregate demand supported disinflation and the underlying trend of core inflation improved.",
        "However, the tax rise in fuel products restrained the recovery in inflation through energy and transport prices.",
        "Although the developments in TL-denominated import prices are expected to push inflation upwards, the mild course of aggregate demand is projected to support the gradual decline in core inflation.",
        "Moreover, forecasts are based on the assumption that the year-end food inflation in 2016 and 2017 will be lower than the projections of the previous Report amid the tourism-induced slowdown in food demand and the actions taken by the Food Committee.",
        "Accordingly, the year-end consumer inflation forecast for 2016 remained unchanged as downside and upside effects on inflation cancelled each other out.",
        "On the other hand, end-2017 consumer inflation forecast was revised upwards by 0.5 points as the upside effects driven by import prices outweighed the effects of the downward revision in the output gap and food inflation.",
        "Overall financial conditions is buoyed by macroprudential arrangements and reduced tightness in monetary conditions thanks to the CBRT’s policy actions.",
        "The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate has partially passed through to loan and deposit rates.",
        "Supported also by the recently enforced macroprudential measures, consumer loans displayed recovery in the last couple of months.",
        "On the other hand, due to global and geopolitical developments that had effects on domestic financial markets, tightness in loan conditions has not witnessed a notable decline yet.",
        "As the downgrade of Turkey’s sovereign credit rating to below investment grade at the end of September was largely anticipated by markets, the reaction of financial markets remained limited.",
        "Even though this downgrade weighs on external funding costs, loan conditions are supported by liquidity measures, macroprudential arrangements and other incentives.",
        "On the other hand, the CBRT may introduce accommodative adjustments to required reserves and other liquidity instruments in case of a higher-than-expected tightness in financial conditions.",
        "The latest data indicate a significant slowdown in economic activity in the third quarter.",
        "Recent accommodative measures and incentives are projected to stimulate a rebound in domestic demand starting from the last quarter.",
        "Accordingly, economic activity is expected to register a mild growth in the remainder of 2016 and throughout 2017.",
        "However, the pace of the recovery in tourism revenues, the global economic outlook, the uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of advanced economies and geopolitical developments pose downside risks to economic activity.",
        "The CBRT will continue to monitor closely the impacts of the developments in economic activity on price stability and financial stability.",
        "There are both upside and downside risks to inflation forecasts.",
        "Inflation may settle on a lower-than-expected path, should economic activity recover at a slower-than-envisioned pace in the upcoming period.",
        "On the other hand, uncertainties regarding oil prices and global markets pose an upside risk to inflation through the cost channel.",
        "Meanwhile, the volatility in food prices pose risks in both directions for 2017.",
        "The CBRT will closely monitor the developments affecting inflation and take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.",
        "Leading indicators for the third quarter of 2016 point to a mild improvement in global economic activity.",
        "However, due to the historically low levels of global growth and trade volume, interest rates in advanced economies remain low.",
        "Accordingly, risk appetite towards emerging economies has followed a robust course in recent months.",
        "On the other hand, uncertainties regarding global monetary policies cause fluctuations in portfolio inflows.",
        "In fact, amid strengthened perceptions about the Fed’s possible rate hike coupled with the uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of other advanced economies, portfolio flows towards emerging economies have recently trended downwards after a surge following the previous reporting period.",
        "Against this background, marginal funding rate, which was gradually lowered under the simplification process since March 2016, was kept constant in October.",
        "The completion of the simplification will ensure funding via a single rate, thereby bringing short-term market rates closer to the CBRT funding rate.",
        "Simplification is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism by providing better assessment of the monetary policy stance.",
        "Therefore, simplification of the monetary policy will be finalized within a reasonable schedule.",
        "The direction and the timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.",
        "Despite experiencing significant external shocks in recent years, the adopted policy framework proved successful in containing the deterioration in inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "However, price stability is yet to be achieved.",
        "Ten years of experience in inflation targeting showed that combatting inflation requires joint efforts.",
        "Thus, to reduce inflation to the 5-percent target permanently, all institutions must fulfill their duties under a holistic approach by also taking structural factors into account.",
        "In this respect, actions taken by the Food Committee set an invaluable precedent.",
        "In the upcoming period, the CBRT will contribute to these efforts by undertaking extensive studies to raise awareness regarding structural issues in inflation dynamics.",
        "In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will continue to depend on the inflation outlook.",
        "The CBRT will maintain its cautious monetary policy stance by taking into account the developments regarding inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation.",
        "Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks.",
        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant.",
        "Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping the interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.",
        "In June, consumer prices increased by 0.47 percent, and annual inflation went up by 1.06 points to 7.64 percent.",
        "In this period, food inflation posted a notable rise due to the correction in unprocessed food prices and the base effect.",
        "Annual inflation in core indicators registered a decline, while the underlying trends remained virtually unchanged.",
        "As projected in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting in the previous month, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages climbed to 6.63 percent in June due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "The prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in unprocessed food category increased notably.",
        "Hence, annual inflation in unprocessed food prices increased by around 9 points to 4.62 percent given the low base effect.",
        "On the other hand, processed food inflation posted the lowest monthly rate of increase over the last 3 years and annual inflation in this category declined to 8.38 percent.",
        "Preliminary indicators in July point out that annual food inflation may continue to rise due to unprocessed food prices.",
        "On the energy front, prices increased by 0.50 percent in line with the international oil prices, and annual inflation hit 2.33 percent.",
        "Prices of services increased by 0.42 percent, and the annual services inflation decreased by 0.5 points to 8.25 percent in June.",
        "Prices of restaurants and hotels, which have been decelerating in the last couple of months, continued to slow down in June amid prices of accommodation services.",
        "Waning cumulative effects of the Turkish lira depreciation and the favorable course of other services supported the slowdown in the services inflation.",
        "Accordingly, the underlying trend of services inflation recorded an improvement in June.",
        "On the other hand, rents continued with the high-rated increases of the previous two months and recorded an annual inflation of 8.83 percent.",
        "Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.31 points to 9.13 percent in June.",
        "Annual inflation posted a rise in durable goods, but remained flat in other subcategories.",
        "Prices of durable goods displayed an unfavorable outlook mainly due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira in May.",
        "Prices in the automotive sector, which enjoys relatively robust sales in the domestic market, displayed an upsurge in June.",
        "Meanwhile, the labor-intensive furniture sector continued to see price increases, albeit at a decelerating pace.",
        "Accordingly, the underlying core goods inflation increased slightly.",
        "Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is expected to slow down in the remainder of the year.",
        "In sum, consumer inflation increased in June mainly owing to the unprocessed food prices.",
        "Core inflation indicators continued to decline, albeit at a limited pace.",
        "The price hikes to tobacco products in July will pose upward pressure on consumer inflation.",
        "The Committee highlighted that inflation may register an upsurge in the short term on account of the developments in unprocessed food and tobacco prices.",
        "Meanwhile, core inflation is expected to sustain its gradual downtrend.",
        "Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate an ongoing yet slowing uptrend in economic activity.",
        "Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index increased by 1.6 percent month-on-month in May; however, the sluggish course in April caused production to see a quarterly fall of 0.4 percent during April-May period.",
        "Current indicators for June suggest that industrial production may follow a more moderate path compared to May.",
        "Survey indicators on output and orders were down in June, while automobile manufacturing recorded a small drop.",
        "Data on the spending side point to a modest course in final domestic demand.",
        "The production of consumer goods remained horizontal during April-May period, whereas the imports thereof declined.",
        "A similar pattern was observed in the production and imports of investment goods.",
        "Meanwhile, sales of automobiles and commercial vehicles remained on the rise in the second quarter.",
        "Firms’ investment demand was relatively weak in the second quarter.",
        "In the April-May period, the non-gold export quantity index was up only slightly from the first quarter, while the non-gold import quantity index posted a fall.",
        "Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance.",
        "Despite heightened geopolitical risks, exports to the European Union countries continue to grow at an accelerated pace in the recent period.",
        "In this regard, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility supports exports.",
        "Yet, the possible spillovers of falling tourism revenues on the current account deficit may be felt more markedly by the summer months.",
        "Meanwhile, commodity prices are also expected to become gradually less supportive of the current account deficit in coming months.",
        "Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates remained unchanged month-on-month in April.",
        "In this period, non-farm employment continued to grow, while the rising participation rate restricted the decline in unemployment rates.",
        "The upsurge in construction employment was interrupted, while industrial employment recovered back to 2015 levels after falling in the first few months.",
        "Services employment continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace than in March.",
        "The employment growth in services continues to be driven by public administration and community services.",
        "In the light of leading indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term.",
        "Yet, the data by the Social Security Institution indicate that the stagnant tourism sector has started to have spillovers on employment.",
        "To sum up, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace.",
        "The income channel supports domestic demand through wage increases.",
        "Although geopolitical developments pose persisting downside risks, the growing demand from European Union countries continues to have favorable effects on exports, and thus production.",
        "However, the ongoing slump in the tourism sector poses a downside risk to economic activity and the current account balance.",
        "The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be published in the July Inflation Report.",
        "In the second quarter of the year, inflation increased in line with the projections of the April Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food and energy prices, but went down across core items.",
        "Even though inflation is projected to rise in the short term, core inflation is expected to settle on a milder track across the year.",
        "The recent hikes in unprocessed food prices and the tobacco price adjustments will cause an upsurge in July inflation.",
        "Yet, food prices may see a downward correction in the upcoming periods.",
        "Owing to the measures taken by the Food and Agricultural Product Markets Monitoring Committee (Food Committee) accompanied by the seasonal decline in food demand caused by the tourism sector, the year-end food price inflation is expected to prove lower compared to the previous reporting period.",
        "In addition, owing to the expected deceleration in economic activity in the short term, core inflation is anticipated to exhibit a milder course compared to the previous reporting period across the year.",
        "Meanwhile, the minimum wage hike is estimated to have a limited effect on core inflation on the back of state support.",
        "Given the forecast assumptions and external conditions, inflation forecasts for the upcoming period were left unchanged from the previous Inflation Report.",
        "Financial conditions continue to be tight despite the recent rise in the global risk appetite, which slightly eased conditions.",
        "Financial conditions are likely to remain tight in the short term owing to domestic developments and weaker capital flows.",
        "Accordingly, loan growth rates are not expected to recover notably.",
        "The moderate course of loans is driven not only by demand but also by the supply-side factors.",
        "Recent surveys show that loan standards did not display any easing.",
        "Domestic developments have recently led to fluctuations in markets.",
        "Liquidity measures taken by the Committee have partially limited the volatility in markets.",
        "It is projected that the effects of the fluctuations in markets will prove temporary and Turkey will sustain its resilience through its sound economic fundamentals.",
        "On the other hand, to balance the short-term effects of the tightness in financial conditions, the Committee may make downside adjustments to required reserves, if deemed necessary.",
        "Economic activity maintains a moderate and stable course of growth.",
        "Consumption spending fuels the domestic demand, while investments remain relatively sluggish.",
        "Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to the European Union countries remain strong.",
        "Restored relations with Russia may support external demand as of the last quarter.",
        "Accordingly, exports are expected to provide further support to growth in the upcoming period.",
        "Meanwhile, the steady increase in employment and wage developments boost domestic demand through the income channel.",
        "In this respect, economic activity is expected to grow moderately across the year.",
        "Recent terrorist attacks and domestic developments pose a downside risk to economic activity especially through the tourism sector.",
        "Thus, the economy may witness a slowdown in the second and third quarters in which tourism revenues register high share within economic activity.",
        "In fact, leading indicators of the second quarter point to a quarter-on-quarter deceleration, which may also continue through the third quarter.",
        "On the other hand, the economy is expected to maintain a steady course of growth amid structural arrangements and investment incentives.",
        "Against this background, risks to economic activity are likely to be balanced in the medium term.",
        "The current account deficit may widen slightly in the short term even though external balances continue to recover.",
        "The current account balance is being positively affected by the lagged effects of the decline in energy prices.",
        "Moreover, the moderate course of loans and the increasing share of commercial loans in loan composition also support the improvement in the current account balance.",
        "However, the fact that the current economic growth is fueled by the domestic demand and that the tourism sector is experiencing a slowdown signals for a possible deceleration in the recovery of the current account balance in the upcoming period.",
        "Yet, the current account deficit is estimated to hover at reasonable and predictable levels across the year.",
        "Inflation forecasts accommodate both upside and downside risks.",
        "Recent exchange rate developments pose an upside risk to inflation through the cost channel.",
        "Moreover, the possible adjustments to administered prices and taxes to compensate for the effect of the recent rise in budget expenditures on fiscal balances may push inflation upwards towards the end of the year.",
        "On the other hand, latest domestic developments constitute downside risks to demand and inflation through the confidence channel and the tourism sector.",
        "The Committee will closely monitor the developments affecting inflation and take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.",
        "Despite experiencing significant external shocks in recent years, the adopted policy framework was successful in containing the deterioration in inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "However, at this point, price stability is yet to be achieved.",
        "Ten years of experience with the inflation targeting regime showed that combatting inflation requires joint efforts.",

        "In this respect, actions taken by the Food Committee set an invaluable precedent.",
        "In the upcoming period, the CBRT will contribute to these efforts by undertaking extensive studies to examine structural issues in inflation dynamics.",
        "Global financial markets and capital flows remain highly volatile.",
        "Despite the recent slight rise in the risk appetite, persisting concerns over global growth and uncertainties in global monetary policies feed into volatility.",
        "The tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policy and the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 enhanced the resilience of the economy against external shocks to a certain extent.",
        "However, adverse domestic developments may cause fluctuations in markets if accompanied by global volatilities and this may place extra pressure on financial conditions.",
        "The Committee will closely monitor the developments in both global and domestic markets and take necessary stabilizing measures by utilizing its large variety of tools.",
        "The recent monetary policy decisions of the Committee should be evaluated under the scope of the simplification process.",
        "The ultimate aim of the simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate.",
        "The simplification is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism.",
        "Therefore, simplification of the monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule.",
        "The pace and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.",
        "Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook.",
        "The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices.",
        "A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.",

        "In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant.",
        "Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."
