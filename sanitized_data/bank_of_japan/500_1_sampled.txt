However, members shared the view that the outlook was attended by a significant level of uncertainty, given that economic activity was likely to be strongly affected by developments in overseas economies and global financial markets.
This operation has been renamed to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
They concluded that developments in private consumption warranted conservative forecasting.
However, slack in supply and demand conditions and slower growth in wages continued to exert downward pressure.
In relation to one of the purposes of the policy -- that is, to influence longer-term interest rates -- some members were of the view that it was important for the Bank to secure market confidence in its policy time horizon, and in doing so, explain consistently to the public that it would maintain the virtually zero interest rate policy until it judged that price stability was in sight.
(2) At the Council for the Realization of Work Style Reform, the prime minister had asked the industrial sector to (1) conduct wage increases of at least the same extent as those for 2016, (2) implement base pay increases for a fourth consecutive year, (3) discuss wage increases that took inflation expectations into consideration, and (4) improve transaction terms for subcontractors and other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Economic activity in Russia remained severe but had generally bottomed out, mainly due to a halt in the decline in commodity prices.
(3) The subprime mortgage problem, which had begun to be resolved, still required careful monitoring.
As mentioned earlier, each country had responded to the spread of COVID-19 in consideration of sustaining economic activity.
Voting against the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.
The consumption activity index (CAI; real, travel balance adjusted) had declined for the January-March quarter of 2024, due to the effects of mild winter weather and suspension of production and shipment at some automakers.
Thereafter, it was projected to continue on a moderate increasing trend, mainly reflecting the recovery in emerging economies and the effects resulting from the set of stimulus measures materializing.
Some members expressed the opinion that, with a view to promoting the transition from the first stage to the second stage of the transmission mechanism of monetary easing, the Bank had been making contributions as the central bank through, for example, the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth.
Members also agreed that consumer prices in both fiscal 2007 and 2008 were likely to evolve broadly in line with the projection in the April Outlook Report.
A few members noted, however, that attention should be paid to upside risks in the Chinese economy.
Most members pointed to the fact that Japan's economy had recently shown signs of a pick-up and was in an important phase of returning to a moderate recovery path, and that the government had announced that it would formulate measures for strengthening the growth potential of Japan's economy and promote them strongly.
Some members pointed out that the Bank's Opinion Survey on the General prices.
(2) The Japanese economy was recovering at a moderate pace and was expected to continue to do so.
They shared the recognition that business spending, such as business fixed investment, was expected to decrease, mainly in industries affected strongly by substantial declines in exports and consumption, and that thereafter it was likely to pick up as the impact of COVID-19 waned.
They concurred that it was appropriate to increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Program by about 10 trillion yen, in order to make financial conditions for economic entities such as firms and households even more accommodative by further encouraging a decline in longer-term market interest rates and a reduction in risk premiums.
A few members expressed the view that overseas economies were unlikely to recover in the short run, given that adjustments in the U.S. housing market, which had caused financial system disruptions in the United States and Europe, had not made progress and a negative feedback loop was already operating between financial markets and economic activity.
Long-term interest rates in the United States and Germany had risen temporarily due to the reduced expectations for further monetary easing but were recently on a declining trend, mainly reflecting relatively weak economic indicators and concerns over the European debt problem.
Members then concurred that a positive output gap had taken hold, given the recent tightening of labor market conditions and the increase in capacity utilization rates, with the latter reflecting a rise in production.
However, the issuing environment for CP and corporate bonds had been favorable, and the lending attitudes of private banks had continued to be accommodative.
With respect to overseas financial markets, along with aggressive macroeconomic policies conducted by each country and region, market sentiment had been improving, reflecting, for example, the easing of preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 followed by a resumption of economic activity and expectations for the development of medicines and vaccines.
A few members expressed the view that firms continued to see financial institutions' lending attitudes as being on an improving trend.
They continued that, nevertheless, as these developments would lead to an increased tightening of labor market conditions during the course of the economic recovery, wage growth was expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income was projected to continue increasing.
As for the employment and income situation, one member said that deterioration in the employment situation had been evident, as seen, for example, in the number of employed persons not at work remaining high and a rise in the unemployment rate.
In relation to this, a few other members commented that, since European financial institutions were currently reducing their assets only at a moderate pace, other financial institutions were able to partly offset the reduction in some way.
With regard to domestic private demand, business fixed investment was picking up as a whole.
Many members said that the forecasts of Policy Board members and the Risk Balance Charts were merely reference materials supplementary to the written explanations of the mechanisms behind developments in the economy and prices, and this should be understood by the public, including market participants.
With regard to developments in overseas economies by region, members concurred that the U.S. economy had been on a recovery trend, assisted by firmness in the employment and income situation and in household spending, although the industrial sector had lacked momentum, mainly against the background of the slowdown in emerging economies.
(3) The government would like the Bank, based on its economic assessment above and taking full account of the government's policy efforts, to continue to support the economy by conducting monetary policy in a flexible and timely manner.
As for prices, the year-on-year rate of increase in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator for all items excluding food and energy had been in the range of 1.0-1.5 percent.
Exports were expected to continue to rise against the background of the expansion of overseas economies as a whole.
The issuing environment for CP and corporate bonds was favorable, and the lending attitude of private banks had continued to be accommodative.
One member added that there was a risk that extreme trade protectionism would disrupt established global supply chains and bring about a contraction in global trade, which finally had been recovering.
These members then expressed the recognition that it was therefore important for the Bank to continue to engage in careful communication.
The government had convened the first Zone Council for the Okinawa Prefecture zone, which meant that it had convened Zone Councils in all of the six special zones it had identified.
With regard to the recent weakness, many members pointed to the effects of (1) the deceleration in overseas economies, (2) recent developments in the relations between Japan and China, and (3) the ending of subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars.
On this point, a few members said that some of the factors that underpinned the current firmness in private consumption were likely to dissipate: for example, the budget allocated for subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars would run out and pent-up demand following the earthquake disaster would wane.
On Asian economies, members concurred that China and India continued to show high growth.
The member continued that it would therefore be appropriate to increase the amount of the Program by about 5 trillion yen.
One member was of the opinion that firms' wage- and price-setting behavior had been changing to behavior that assumed a continuous rise in prices, and this provided evidence that the deflationary mindset was starting to be dispelled.
A few members said that the recent growth in exports had been stronger than assumed in the projection in the April 2010 Outlook Report.
One member said that corporate bond issuance and public offering of stocks had subsided amid reduced demand for funds among firms.
One member, however, noted that there were signs of an improvement in consumer confidence reflecting the recent decline in crude oil prices and this might provide impetus to car purchases, for example.
In relation to this point, one member expressed concern that the June Tankan indicated that the diffusion index of business sentiment in the accommodations as well as the eating and drinking services industries remained significantly negative, not only for the current situation but also for the outlook.
With regard to economic activity, members agreed that the economy had been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment had shown some weakness, mainly affected by the slowdown in overseas economies and natural disasters.
It was expected to turn upward, albeit marginally, in the October-December quarter.
Sales at department stores and supermarkets, which primarily sold nondurable and semi-durable consumer goods, had been more or less unchanged, with fluctuations caused by the weather.
The Policy Board approved unanimously the minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of January 22 and 23, 2018 for release on March 14.
(1) The government greatly welcomed the Bank's decision at the previous meeting to implement drastic measures.
In a situation where reconstruction-related demand was likely to persist, in order to continue supporting the efforts of financial institutions in disaster areas toward rebuilding, the staff considered it appropriate for the Bank to extend the deadline for new applications for loans under the operation by one year, to April 30, 2014, while keeping the existing 1 trillion yen ceiling for the outstanding balance of loans.
(3) Third, it would be appropriate for the Bank to integrate loan durations -- which were currently "3 months" or "6 months" -- into "within 6 months" under the fixed-rate operation, in order to respond flexibly to financial institutions' liquidity demand.
Members made an assessment in terms of the first perspective; that is, they assessed the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity and prices considered to be the most likely through fiscal 2012.
In addition, one member noted that, although the momentum toward 2 percent inflation was maintained, it likely would take a certain amount of time to achieve the target.
Members discussed the draft of "The Bank's View" in the October 2016 Outlook Report (consisting of "The Bank's View" and "The Background") and formed a majority view.
(4) With regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), considerable progress had been made at a ministerial meeting held recently in Hawaii, in that agreement had been reached on various issues; however, it was agreed that further discussions were required for some specific issues.
In terms of global financial markets, members agreed that some nervousness had been seen in some parts of the markets in particular, due to heightened uncertainty over the political situation in Italy and the European situation regarding the support package for Cyprus.
Members voted unanimously to approve the staff proposal and agreed that the decision should be made public.
The government was highly concerned that the appreciation of the yen and increased evidence of sluggishness in overseas economies, due to the anxiety over debt problems in Europe, continued to pose significant downside risks to the Japanese economy.
Some members noted that relatively weak developments had been observed in indicators of consumer sentiment, but these indicators had recently shown signs of bottoming out.
The government had been holding the Government-Labor-Management Meetings for Realizing a Positive Cycle of the Economy.
As for long-term interest rates, yields on government bonds with short-term maturities had been more or less unchanged and those with medium- to long-term maturities remained in a similar situation, although they exhibited developments that followed yields on government bonds in the United States.
Many members commented that the Bank needed to further exchange views with financial institutions based on the preliminary framework to be made public immediately after the meeting, and draw up concrete plans for the measure that included operational details.
This member continued, however, that these changes did not reflect an economic downturn.
Fifth, with regard to the future conduct of monetary policy, he proposed a new expression that "the Bank will, with the aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term, continue to provide consistent support from the financial side.
Yield differentials between their sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasuries, which had fluctuated widely, had expanded recently.
It also expected the Bank to conduct appropriate monetary policy while carefully monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the economy as well as developments in financial and capital markets.
One of these members added that, according to the aggregate results of wage negotiations compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) so far, movements toward wage increases were expected to spread even among small firms.
In this situation, the year-on-year rate of increase in the amount outstanding of bank lending had been at around 3.5 percent.
As for domestic demand in the NIEs and the ASEAN countries, while the rate of increase in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing, private consumption remained firm.
Industrial production had bottomed out, due in part to the progress in inventory adjustments.
This operation would be renamed to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
On this basis, many members expressed the view that, although some indicators -- such as machinery orders for May -- had shown some weakness, firms were maintaining a positive attitude, as the June _Tankan indicated that firms were_ planning to steadily increase fixed investment in fiscal 2014.
The chairman first provided the following explanation for calling an unscheduled Monetary Policy Meeting.
As for housing investment, the pick-up had paused since the middle of 2015 but resumed recently, underpinned by accommodative financial conditions.
The pick-up in indicators related to consumer sentiment was also becoming evident.
Many members expressed the view that the scenario presented in the April 2011 Outlook Report -- that the economy would return to a moderate recovery path from the second half of fiscal 2011 -- remained intact, and growth prospects for fiscal 2012 would likely remain broadly unchanged from the April forecasts.
Based on their assessment of the economic and financial situation, members agreed that their basic thinking remained unchanged on the future path of monetary policy: the Bank would adjust the level of the policy interest rate gradually in the light of developments in economic activity and prices, while maintaining the accommodative financial conditions ensuing from very low interest rates for some time.
One member said that, due to the tightening of labor market conditions, an increasing number of firms would raise wages of regular employees with the aim of securing the labor force and improve labor productivity through IT investment and the working-style reform.
By promoting these measures, the government would raise the attractiveness of Japanese firms and encourage the expansion of domestic and foreign investment, boosting economic growth and strengthening the competitiveness of the Japanese economy.
The supplementary budget would thoroughly incorporate, for example, measures that should be urgently implemented -- taking into account the Urgent Policies to Realize a Society in Which All Citizens are Dynamically Engaged and the Comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)-Related Policy Framework -- while firmly maintaining the target of halving its primary balance deficit relative to GDP for fiscal 2015.
Members also shared the recognition that, on the price front, careful attention should be paid to the responsiveness of prices to the aggregate supply and demand balance as well as future developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and international commodity prices.
Based on this discussion, the chairman formulated the Statement on Monetary Policy and put it to a vote.
On this basis, a few members said that the outlook for the economy was highly uncertain and that the risk of it slowing for longer than expected warranted attention.
Many members commented that, although risk aversion among investors had temporarily eased following the announcement of financial assistance to Spain by the Eurogroup, the likelihood that tensions in the markets could further intensify was not small, as there remained a high degree of uncertainty about the European debt problem -- including how fiscal consolidation and economic structural reforms in Greece following its election in June would develop -- and consequently the global economy.
A few members added that, in Europe, progress had not been made among countries in terms of seeking agreement on the conditionalities for financial assistance to peripheral countries or with regard to identifying the direction to be taken in the euro area integration, thereby leading to the repeat of a situation where the motivation to take coordinated policy actions weakened and a conflict of interests among European countries surfaced whenever markets more or less regained stability.
As for the outlook, they continued that the growth rates of these economies would increase as the virtuous circle of production, income, and spending was likely to gradually strengthen.
They agreed that it would be appropriate for the Bank to substantially increase the total size of the Program, by about 10 trillion yen, from about 70 trillion yen to about 80 trillion yen.
(1) The Japanese economy had been exhibiting signs of upward movement recently, as seen in the steady restoration of supply chains and improvement in consumer sentiment.
One member said that exports to the United States had continued to be on an uptrend as a whole, although the economic slowdown had had some effects, for example, a slowing of growth in exports of automobile-related goods and a decline in those of construction machinery.
Exports were increasing moderately.
The government expected that, with the funds-supplying operation decided at this meeting to support financial institutions in the disaster areas, restoration and rebuilding in these areas would be fully supported from the financial aspect.
Economic growth in India had decelerated, and that in the NIEs and the ASEAN countries had been sluggish.
One member noted that, looking at price movements in October by item, the number of items whose price change from a year earlier turned positive exceeded the number of items whose price change turned negative.
A different member expressed the recognition that it was essential for the Bank to aim to achieve the price stability target while gaining the public's understanding on the importance of overcoming deflation, so that a shift in firms' stance toward raising prices would not be interpreted in a negative manner.
Regarding international commodity prices, while prices of industrial metals had risen, those of crude oil and agricultural products had declined.
Thereafter, they were projected to continue increasing moderately, as the growth rates of overseas economies were likely to rise, albeit with fluctuations resulting mainly from the subsequent decline in IT-related demand following the current increase.
Exports and industrial production had declined due to the slowdown in overseas economies since last year, as well as the decrease in external demand, mainly from China, and the effects on the global supply chain of stopping production, also mainly in China, reflecting the outbreak of COVID-19.
Based on the discussion, members made an assessment in terms of the first perspective, that is to say, they assessed the most likely outlook for economic activity and prices.
As for the outlook, the diffusion index was projected to deteriorate, mainly in view of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase; nevertheless, it was still projected to be in "favorable" territory to a marginal degree.
Members concurred that the first provisional aggregate results for the wage growth rate agreed in the revealed a high figure that clearly exceeded the rate for 2023.
These members then expressed the view that, by establishing a program on its balance sheet through which the Bank would make the purchase, the Bank would be able to clearly distinguish and treat the purchase separately from conventional purchases of long-term government bonds, which were conducted in accordance with the long-term trend of increase in banknotes.
One member added that the rate of change for all items less fresh food and energy had been stagnant at slightly above 0 percent, and this was due to the effects of the earlier sluggishness in private consumption and the yen's appreciation appearing with a time lag.
Regarding the staff's proposal on forward guidance, many members expressed the recognition that it was appropriate from the viewpoint of strengthening the Bank's commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, and of ensuring public confidence in its policy conduct.
Members discussed the economic and financial conditions abroad, and shared the view that overseas economies were still recovering at a slower but moderate pace, led by high growth in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, and would continue to recover.
(2) In order to prevent the hollowing out of domestic industries, the government deemed it important to promptly proceed with the following, by utilizing such means as the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2011: (1) mitigate the pain caused by the appreciation of the yen by further expanding financial support to small firms; (2) take such measures as a decisive increase in location subsidies to firms, to prevent the hollowing out of domestic industries and build a robust economy that was resilient to risks; and (3) make the maximum use of merits of the yen's appreciation through Japanese firms' acquisitions of foreign firms and interests in natural resources.
Members shared the view that, although the pace of decline in the CPI was likely to continue moderating as the supply and demand balance improved, downward pressure on prices was likely to persist for an extended period because the pace of economic recovery would probably be only moderate.
As for employment and income, in a situation where firms were increasingly feeling a shortage of labor, household income had continued rising moderately.
Industrial production has been more or less flat as a trend, but it has declined recently, partly due to the effects of a suspension of production and shipment at some automakers.
Members concurred that overseas economies had been depressed significantly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
These members said that, in addition to successive monetary easing measures implemented in response to the recent decline in inflation rates, future infrastructure investment plans were being brought forward and measures to stimulate consumption had been taken, and that, together with improvement in households' real purchasing power, these measures were likely to gradually produce policy effects.
Many members shared the view that financial conditions in Japan had remained tight as a whole despite improved issuing conditions for CP and corporate bonds.
In relation to this point, a different member said that it was also important for the Bank to continue to explain thoroughly that its JGB purchases were not conducted for the purpose of financing the fiscal deficit.
As for the employment and income situation, members concurred that household income had continued rising moderately in a situation where various indicators had continued to show tighter labor market conditions.
Meanwhile, regarding the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019, one member stated that the negative impact on Japan's economy likely would be limited compared to the previous hike in 2014, due partly to the effects of various measures to be taken by the government.
In the foreign exchange market, the yen continued to move within a narrow range of around 76-78 yen against the U.S. dollar.
Reflecting these developments in demand, the decrease in production was coming to a halt.
Some members, however, said that the deceleration of overseas economic growth seemed to be starting to affect Japan's exports, and therefore due attention should be paid to the degree of the deceleration.
As for the interbank market, interest rates on term instruments had been at high levels, reflecting concerns about counterparty risk.
Regarding risks to the financial system, members shared the recognition that, if COVID-19 had a larger impact than expected, there was a risk that deterioration in the real economy would affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy.
One member -- while noting the relatively weak developments in consumer confidence since October 2013 -- said that this might be attributable to consumers' awareness of the consumption tax hike, and future developments warranted attention.
The number of housing starts, which was a leading indicator of housing investment and had been more or less flat from January 2008 until recently, had dropped.
As for prices, international commodity prices had been more or less level.
One member said that, in order to increase income, including base pay, an arrangement involving the government similar to the one made last year might also be necessary this year.
A different member emphasized that the Bank's expansion of the QQE was necessary as a preemptive action, given that in Japan, where inflation expectations had not been anchored, a decline in the actual inflation rate affected inflation expectations.
Private consumption continued to increase against the background of a moderate recovery in the employment situation; nevertheless, in a situation where balance-sheet adjustments continued to weigh on the economy, the pace of increase had been slowing recently due to a decline in real purchasing power brought about by the earlier rise in crude oil prices.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average had recently dropped to the range of 15,000-15,500 yen.
Some members pointed out that this reflected to some extent structural factors such as the shift of Japanese manufacturers' production sites to overseas.
Some members said that business fixed investment on a real GDP basis and shipments of capital goods continued to increase in the January-March quarter.
Another member noted the possibility that downward pressure on scheduled cash earnings would remain, reflecting the rising trend in the ratio of part-time workers.
The member continued that, therefore, with regard to the purchases of the super-long-term JGBs, an adjustment should be considered in such a way that it would not be incorrectly taken as being part of an exit strategy.
These members then commented that this situation partly enabled firms to absorb cost increases and take a cautious price-setting stance.
Many members said that corporate profits continued to improve, despite the slowdown in emerging economies, due in part to the effects of the yen's depreciation as well as the decline in crude oil prices, and that these profits had increased to a record-high level.
At the Meeting of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, initiatives regarding a variety of sectors were being discussed -- such as next-generation administrative services, regional revitalization, and human capital investment -- in view of the formulation of the basic policies on economic and fiscal management and reform to be completed this summer.
Meanwhile, the deceleration of economic growth in India had come to a halt.
Some members commented that the growth in demand for some IT-related goods was slowing around the world.
Business fixed investment had been depressed substantially, mainly reflecting the decline in corporate profits.
Regarding the direction of the Bank's monetary policy responses to recent developments, members concurred that it was appropriate for the Bank to further enhance monetary easing, given that, due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19 at home and abroad, Japan's economy had been in an increasingly severe situation and financial conditions had been less accommodative in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions.
As for the effects of the sovereign debt problems in Europe, a few members noted that it was also necessary to pay attention to the risk that increased risk aversion among investors would lead to a rapid outflow of funds from the capital markets in emerging economies.
Meanwhile, a different member commented that, although the unemployment rate remained on a declining trend, the number of new job openings was decreasing, suggesting somewhat of a slowdown in economic activity.
A few members said that consumer sentiment had become more cautious due to deterioration in consumers' view of the economy and the rise in prices.
In response, some members expressed a more cautious view on the outlook for prices.
Based on this, most members shared the view that, as for policy rates, it would expect short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.
A few members, however, said that it was necessary to pay attention to whether private consumption would be dampened by the following factors: (1) the budget allocated for subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars would run out before long, (2) the cuts in the salaries of government employees were likely to exert negative effects, and (3) the level of summer bonus payments in 2012 was projected to be somewhat weak.
On this basis, some members noted that there were signs of weakness in some indicators, reflecting the waning effects of subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars and somewhat low bonuses in the summer.
Production, while remaining more or less flat, had shown some signs of picking up.
A different member expressed the view that while the rate of increase in the CPI would definitely rise gradually as a trend, there remained some uncertainty about the precise pace of its rise.
However, with firms' persistent sense of excessive capital stock, the pace of improvement in business fixed investment was likely to remain moderate.
Consumer sentiment had been improving recently.
The member then added that, in order to proceed deliberately along the path of monetary policy normalization in response to developments in economic activity and prices, the Bank needed to decide on the termination of the negative interest rate policy at an appropriate timing as a first step toward the normalization.
The government was of the view that the Bank's measures proposed at this meeting aimed to steadily increase the amount outstanding of the Program.
Some members expressed the view that, by working on risk premiums, the Bank would encourage risk-taking activity within the overall economy, which would in turn increase the economy's productivity and strengthen competitiveness, thereby further enhancing the effects of monetary easing.
In this situation, the Bank had actively injected liquidity into the money market through both same-day-start and future-day-start operations to ensure market stability.
They had recovered, however, due to the announcement of financial assistance to Spain by the Eurogroup and heightened expectations for additional monetary easing.
In such a case, the Bank should increase the amount for each asset category as follows: about 0.5 trillion yen for JGBs; about 1.0 trillion yen for T-Bills; about 1.5 trillion yen for CP and corporate bonds, respectively; about 0.45 trillion yen for exchange-traded funds (ETFs); and about 0.05 trillion yen for Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs).
However, some members noted that the pick-up in overseas economies had been only moderate and uneven.
Some members, noting that households' and firms' short-term inflation expectations were susceptible to actual price developments, expressed the view that attention should be paid to the possibility of heightened expectations that prices were unlikely to rise, given that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI had remained at a low level for a long time, and this in turn could lead to a slower pace of increase in prices than that suggested by the improvement in the negative output gap.
Housing investment had also been showing clear signs of picking up, albeit at a depressed level.
Members first discussed recent developments in global financial markets, and confirmed that, reflecting the further worsening of the Greek problem, strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets in Europe reemerged after the previous Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 30, and there were concerns that these might spread to other markets and financial centers.
Some members said that, in the June 2010 _Tankan, fixed investment plans of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing_ firms for fiscal 2010 were revised upward and the aggregated amount of all industries' plans exceeded the previous year's level for the first time in three years.
A different member pointed out that, as Japanese firms had long been exposed to intense competition, they had improved their production efficiency to secure high international competitiveness.
(2) Although there were no particular concerns about Japanese financial institutions' funding in foreign currencies, it would be appropriate for the Bank -- with the aim of facilitating money market operations as well as ensuring the smooth functioning and stability of the financial markets -- to extend the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangement as proposed, as part of the coordinated central bank actions, together with the effective period of the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral, through August 1, 2012.
A few members noted that the effects of the sovereign debt problems in Europe were observed in some emerging and commodity-exporting economies not only through international trade but also through European financial institutions' reduction of their assets.
As for prices, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, producer prices were rising moderately relative to three months earlier.
Some members expressed concern about a slowdown in private consumption in major countries such as Germany, where it had been rising moderately.
However, members continued that, with the aim of operating the Program more smoothly, it would be appropriate to reduce the maximum outstanding amount of the fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral by about 5 trillion yen and instead allocate that amount to the purchase of JGBs.
In response, a few members, noting that central banks sought to conduct monetary policy in an appropriate manner with a view to stabilizing economic activity and prices in their own countries, expressed the recognition that the Bank needed to do likewise while taking account of developments in Japan's economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions.
Private consumption had been generally picking up.
A different member said that the pace of increase in the number of employees in the Labour Force Survey had been slowing recently, and thus this as well as the ratio of job offers to applicants, which had declined, continued to warrant close monitoring.
Looking at an indicator that represented the difference between the share of items in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for which prices had risen from the previous year and that for which prices had declined in order to capture trend changes in the CPI, this had risen markedly.
The amount outstanding of CP and corporate bonds issued was somewhat above the previous year's level.
They were expected to continue increasing as supply-side constraints eased further, against the background of the improvement in overseas economic conditions.
Based on the above discussions, to reflect the majority view of the members, the chairman formulated the following proposal on the guideline for money market operations and put it to a vote.
Therefore, the government deemed it necessary to pay due attention to price developments and the downside risks to the economy stemming from the slowdown in overseas economies.
The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) had been around zero percent, mainly due to the past drop in crude oil prices.
One of these members expressed the view that, although there did not seem to be any problem with the financial system and the functioning of financial intermediation by financial institutions at this stage, due attention needed to be paid to the changes in the market environment at home and abroad, such as the flattening of the yield curve for U.S. Treasuries and the rise in funding costs for foreign currencies, as well as to their impact on financial institutions' profits and the financial system.
Regarding prices, some members commented that the inflation rate was trending down.
Housing The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.
Private consumption was expected to remain resilient as a trend, although it would show some weakness for the time being, mainly since car sales had fallen back.
However, some members noted that the effects of QQE continued to be substantial, given that interest rates in Japan had been stable at low levels across the entire yield curve despite the rise in overseas interest rates.
In response to the staff's explanation, members concurred that it was appropriate to change the amount of each ETF to be purchased, as proposed by the staff.
On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend.
The government would thoroughly fulfill its role specified in the joint statement, such as promoting measures to strengthen the competitiveness and growth potential of the economy and those aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure.
A few members pointed out that the in business fixed investment for the January-March quarter of 2016, and that various surveys revealed that firms also planned to steadily increase fixed investment for fiscal in the global economy and turbulence in the financial markets, firms had maintained their positive fixed investment stance, supported in part by the further decline in real interest rates brought about by Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate.
The European economy continued to recover steadily, albeit at a moderate pace, mainly in the household sector.
Some members, however, expressed the view that risks had heightened in financial markets again with rising expectations about debt restructuring in Greece, as witnessed by the recurrence of the widening of the yield spreads of government bonds issued by some peripheral European countries over those issued by Germany.
Meanwhile, members reaffirmed that (1) it was extremely important to ensure the credibility of fiscal management; and (2) it was for this reason that they expected the government to steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure, in line with the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan.
Some other members commented that uncertainty about corporate financing had decreased as Japan's economy had started to pick up.
As for the outlook, members shared the recognition that, due in part to the effects resulting from the set of economic measures, the tightening of labor market conditions was likely to continue, accompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate, and capacity utilization rates also were likely to increase again as exports and production would probably pick up.
One member said that the member was previously concerned about the possibility that the recovery in production might slow in summer 2009, but acknowledged that production had turned out to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated, reflecting the pick-up in iron and steel production, which had lagged behind.
As for prices, members said that the three-month rate of change in the CGPI had become negative and the CGPI was likely to continue decreasing for the time being, mainly due to the fall in commodity prices.
The Bank, in accordance with the short-term policy interest rate of minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the long-term interest rate, both decided at the previous meeting on April 26 and 27, 2017, had been providing funds through purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and other measures.
Regarding the Bank's JGB purchases, they reconfirmed that, under the current policy framework, the Bank had been conducting the purchases so as to achieve the target level of the long-term interest rate specified by the guideline for market operations, and therefore the amount of such purchases varied to some extent depending on financial market conditions.
(1) On January 22, 2018, the government submitted the budget for fiscal 2018 and the supplementary budget for fiscal 2017 to the Diet.
One member said that no concrete evidence had been presented to suggest a buildup of financial imbalances.
Some members said that, while the money market had remained stable, stock prices and long-term interest rates had declined reflecting increased uncertainties regarding the outlook, and risk aversion in financial markets could heighten further.
The government aimed to secure smooth financial functions, particularly in the disaster areas, working in concert with the Bank.
On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 1 percent.
One of these members added that this point was particularly important because the period around the year-end and early next year was a critical one when firms formulated business plans and conducted wage negotiations.
Regarding fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, they concurred that the pace of increase in private consumption was projected to be moderate, mainly because it was likely to temporarily turn to a decline due to the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019.
A few members, however, were of the opinion that the growth in summer bonus payments was likely to be relatively small reflecting the leveling-off of corporate profits.
It was meaningful that an agreement had been reached on the framework to hold full and constructive discussions led by the deputy prime minister and the vice president, both of whom were in responsible positions.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average had increased moderately, and was moving at around 16,500 yen recently.
As for durable consumer goods, sales of passenger cars had marked a somewhat large decline, reflecting movements in those of small cars with engine sizes of 660cc or less.
(3) With regard to the subprime mortgage problem, central banks had taken measures, including measures to provide liquidity to address elevated pressures in U.S. and European short-term funding markets, and the problem continued to require careful monitoring.
(1) The Japanese economy had been showing weakness recently due to the effects of the disaster, and this was expected to continue for a while.
As for employment and income, in a situation where labor market conditions had continued to tighten, household income had continued rising moderately, supported by the increase in the number of employees.
The Bank will continue with "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.
Some members were of the view that the decline in housing investment had been coming to a halt, as evidenced by the fact that the number of housing starts had picked up, albeit remaining at a low level, and inventory adjustments of condominiums in the metropolitan area had been progressing.
The government considered that these commitments had been received very positively so far by the market in each of the G-7 countries.
A few members, however, said that domestic car sales had recovered somewhat at the 2010 year-end, and the effects of the reverse following the sharp increase in demand were gradually becoming less pronounced.
Members shared the view that the European economy had picked up from a state of significant depression.
As for the outlook, members concurred that overseas economies as a whole were likely to moderately increase their growth rates, as it was likely that advanced economies would continue to see firm growth and emerging economies would move out of their deceleration phase on the back of the developments in advanced economies.
Japan's economy, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures.
As for the outlook, members agreed that Japan's economy was likely to evolve broadly in line with the projection presented in the April Outlook Report.
In relation to economic activity, they were (1) the ongoing financial crises in the United States and Europe and their impact, (2) developments in emerging economies and commodity-exporting countries, (3) developments in energy and materials prices, (4) firms' expectations of future growth, and (5) developments in financial conditions.
The member then expressed the recognition that, if the current pace of purchases continued, however, the Bank could not avoid a situation where JGB purchases would become more difficult through 2018.
Members concurred that the following thinking on the monetary policy stance for the future remained unchanged: the Bank would carefully assess the future outlook for economic activity and prices, closely considering the likelihood of its projections materializing as well as factors posing upside or downside risks, and would conduct monetary policy in an accordingly flexible manner.
On this basis, the member commented that, if the real GDP growth rate rose even slightly from the current level, the unemployment rate would decline and the inflation rate would rise, and this might bring forward the timing of the shift in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance.
In the ASEAN economies, economic recovery seemed to have paused as external demand had been affected by the earlier decline in international commodity prices and production adjustments in China, and as domestic demand had been impacted by the accumulation of household debt and the delay in implementation of government expenditure programs.
With regard to prices, both the year-on-year rate of change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for all items and that for all items excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco had been at around 1 percent.
Many members expressed the view that due attention should be paid to downside risks to the global economy, in the case where growing tides of protectionism were observed.
With regard to the purchases of JGBs, one member commented that it might be necessary to communicate more clearly to the public the relationship between purchases under the Asset Purchase Program and those conducted in terms of money market operations.
On the other hand, exports remained more or less flat, mainly due to the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction, and business fixed investment continued to show relatively weak developments, mainly against the backdrop of a deterioration in business sentiment of manufacturing firms.
In relation to this, some members expressed the recognition that, with regard to private consumption, it was important to examine household income more broadly and give due attention to differences between households.
Meanwhile, firms retained their recovered financial positions on the whole.
As for upside and downside risks to prices, members pointed to the following three factors: (1) developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations; (2) the fact that there were items for which prices were not particularly responsive to the output gap; and (3) developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward.
This member considered these facts to be a positive development.
Nevertheless, most members shared the recognition that it was necessary to keep paying close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost, given that downside risks to overseas economies remained significant.
As for the outlook, members shared the view that overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- would continue to recover moderately.
It expected that this new framework would further enhance deliberations on monetary policy at the Monetary Policy Meetings and secure transparency, and that the Bank would maintain a thorough dialogue with the government.
The Bank conducted money market operations in accordance with the guideline decided at the previous meeting on October 10 and 11, 2007.
(1) According to the first preliminary GDP estimates for the July-September quarter of real GDP had marked negative growth on the whole, reflecting the decline in business fixed investment and the progress in inventory adjustments, although private consumption had turned positive on the back of improvement in real wages.
The European economy had become depressed rapidly due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19.
Meanwhile, a different member expressed the recognition that, while consumption of durable goods and services had been increasing, albeit with fluctuations, that of non-durable goods including food, beverages, and clothes continued to be sluggish; therefore, vulnerability remained in private consumption.
Meanwhile, a different member said it was important to bear in mind that these measures to facilitate corporate financing were expected to perform the role of a safety net.
Under these circumstances, production had increased.
They continued that, on the other hand, the economy might also register lower growth, mainly due to fiscal problems.
Stock prices in emerging economies had also dropped significantly, due mainly to the rise in inflation.
Exports had been more or less flat.
A few of these members expressed the view that, even if those factors were excluded, the pace of increase in machinery orders might be decelerating.
To reflect the view of the members, the chairman formulated a proposal on "The Bank's View" and put it to a vote.
Members agreed that the tension in global financial markets had eased, mainly due to heightened expectations for recovery in business performance, particularly in the United States.
They shared the view that there had been no sign so far of excessively bullish expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial institutions.
On the other hand, some members pointed out that goods consumption had been firm, owing in part to an expansion in stay-at-home consumption.
Based on their assessment of the economic and financial situation, members discussed the monetary policy stance for the immediate future.
Members first discussed the "understanding" -- that is, the level of inflation that each Policy Board member understood, when conducting monetary policy, as being consistent with price stability over the medium to long term.
Some members said that production had recently been growing somewhat faster than expected on the back of steady growth in exports to Asia.
On this basis, some members expressed the opinion that, at this point, it was important for the Bank to examine the effects of the increase in the amount of the Program, including those of the aforementioned financial market developments on economic activity.
On this basis, members shared the recognition that the Bank's massive JGB purchases, through the reduction in risk premia, were restraining upward pressure on interest rates that stemmed from an improvement in perceived business conditions and a pick-up in expected inflation rates.
Exports had also been rising.
One of these members noted the possibility that the decline in U.S. long-term interest rates reflected a decrease in the expected economic growth rate.
Given the strict movement restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the disease, labor force recovery after the Lunar New Year holidays had been sluggish.
Interest rates on CP with low ratings had been at relatively high levels as investors were highly selective about the issues they purchased, but those on CP with high ratings had declined, generally to below the TIBOR rates.
Thereafter, it had depreciated, albeit with fluctuations, partly reflecting speculation about the direction of monetary policy in Japan and the United States.
On the other hand, a different member commented that medium- to long-term growth expectations of firms and households were likely to have declined amid the prolonged economic downturn, and therefore the member was concerned that it might not be easy for the economy to return to a strong recovery path.
As for prices, there were some signs that prices had stopped decreasing across a wide range of items, indicating that deflation was ending.
With respect to overseas financial markets, stock prices in many economies had declined, including those in the United States, which had been considered to be overvalued to some extent.
As for employment and income, growth in household income had recently been sluggish.
Many members expressed the opinion that it would be appropriate to raise the rate to 0.4 percent when the uncollateralized overnight call rate target was raised to rate would be 0.5 percent.
It had then increased slightly for April relative to that quarter, with a pick-up in automobile sales.
Indicators related to consumer confidence -- which had continued to become cautious -- had slightly improved recently, mainly reflecting an increase in winter bonus payments for 2014 and a decline in the prices of petroleum products.
In order to make further strides toward developing an environment conducive to wage increases in small and medium-sized enterprises, the Government-Labor-Management Meeting for Realizing a Positive Cycle of the Economy had been held on April 2, at which time policies to pass on price increases and to improve the productivity of the service industry had been approved.
Housing investment had also been on a moderate pick-up trend.
Meanwhile, some members referred to the continued sluggishness in Japanese stock prices -- as seen in, for example, the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) temporarily falling to around the lowest level since the Lehman shock -- reflecting the further worsening of the sovereign debt problems in Europe.
In response, most members -- while noting that this was one of various options -- expressed the opinion that in the present situation it was appropriate to continue with the Bank's current stance on the operation of the Program.
As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, with the output gap remaining positive.
However, they also agreed that the outlook continued to be attended by a significant level of uncertainty since it would be greatly dependent on the improvement in overseas economies.
One member expressed the view that consumers' acceptance of a rise in prices would gradually increase with the improvement in the employment and income situation.
One member, noting that exports for the April-June quarter of 2017 had decreased slightly on a quarter-on-quarter basis but had increased firmly again for the July-September quarter, expressed the view that no change had been observed in the increasing trend in exports as a whole, driven mainly by IT-related goods and capital goods.
Private consumption was likely to remain generally weak amid the severe employment and income situation, with the exception of durable goods consumption, which would be supported by the effects of various policy measures for the time being.
The members said that it was exceptional for a central bank to commit itself to continuing with monetary easing until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeded 2 percent, considering that there was a time lag until monetary policy took effect.
The rates in Brazil and Russia remained at high levels but had been declining due to the earlier pause in the depreciation of their currencies.
As for interest rates on term instruments, yields on three-month treasury discount bills (T-Bills) had moved further into negative territory and had been at around minus 0.4 percent recently.
This member added, however, that the current rise in energy and materials prices was characterized by a long-term upward trend against the background of the worldwide growth in demand, especially demand from emerging economies, and that attention to the risk that possible changes in inflation expectations of firms and households would generate such effects should not be slackened merely because second-round effects had not emerged so far.
Housing investment has been more or less flat, and public investment has increased moderately.
Public investment was expected to continue increasing for the time being, albeit at a slower pace.
Japanese stock prices had risen, mainly reflecting strong expectations of upward revisions in firms' earnings forecasts.
A different member noted that one option was to reduce the Bank's purchase amount of JGBs based on the supply and demand balance of JGBs, with the aim of restoring market functioning.
In advanced economies, interest rates had generally been more or less flat, albeit with fluctuations, while stock prices as a whole had decreased.
In this situation, industrial production had been on a downward trend and the number of employees had been declining.
It would also implement in a full-fledged manner the "Comprehensive Package Responding to the Yen Appreciation," recently decided by the Cabinet, and thereby preemptively respond to the downside risks to the economy and the risk of a hollowing-out of domestic industries, both stemming mainly from the rapid appreciation of the yen.
Specifically, the Bank will adopt a three-tier system in which the outstanding balance of each financial institution's current account at the Bank will be divided into three tiers, to each of which a positive interest rate, a zero interest rate, or a negative interest rate will be applied, respectively.
The staff would like to propose that the Bank accept the DBJ's request and take the necessary steps.
In addition, a different member expressed the opinion that, in order to achieve the price stability target, it was essential, mainly for small and medium-sized firms, to implement reforms to raise productivity beyond cutting their costs.
On January 22, the budget for fiscal 2016 had been submitted to the Diet.
A few members expressed the view that the risk of inflation had increased further against the backdrop of the continued rise in real estate prices, wage increases in the coastal area, and the rise in food prices resulting from droughts in southwest China.
A few members expressed the view that attention was warranted on the impact that the vote of the United Kingdom to leave the EU would have on the global economy, particularly on the European economy.
(2) The government projected that the economic recovery supported by domestic private demand would continue, as resiliency in the corporate sector was extending into the household sector, and expected that the October Outlook Report would basically share this view.
With regard to the spring wage negotiations, a few members expressed the view that more firms were likely to raise wages in the new fiscal year starting April 2007 than in the previous year.
Some members were of the view that the euro area economy would likely recover only moderately, because economic activity would be constrained by balance-sheet adjustments and moves toward fiscal consolidation.
Sales at department stores and supermarkets, particularly of apparel, had continued to be susceptible to weather conditions, but in terms of the average for the months in the January-March quarter, they were firm.
Members shared the recognition that inflation expectations appeared to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, although some market indicators and survey results had recently shown relatively weak developments.
One member said that, judging from information obtained from business contacts in particular, there seemed to be a risk that demand would decline through an adverse feedback loop between business and household sentiment.
However, signs of a possible pick-up in the coming period had begun to be observed as the production forecast index continued to increase toward March.
Home prices continued to be on a declining trend, and housing investment and business fixed investment had been contracting noticeably.
One member, however, said that wage increases and price rises resulting from supply-side constraints might not be sustainable.
A few members pointed out that the decline in housing investment following the front-loaded increase was partly attributable to the effects of labor shortages and a surge in prices of building materials.
Many members noted that labor market conditions remained tight, as evidenced, for example, by the fact that the active job openings-to-applicants ratio had maintained the high level that exceeded the peak marked during the bubble period while the unemployment rate remained at a low level of around 2.5 percent.
Exports would likely continue their increasing trend for the time being, as those of IT-related goods and capital goods were likely to be firm, and thereafter were expected to continue their moderate increasing trend, with the growth in overseas economies continuing.
As for interest rates on term instruments, yields on treasury discount bills (T-Bills) had fallen slightly, and had been somewhat below the 0.1 percent level for all maturities.
The rate of increase for all items less fresh food and energy had registered 0.8 percent year-on-year for June.
And second, large nonmanufacturing firms' fixed investment plans for fiscal 2007 showed relatively high growth.
Members concurred that overseas economies had moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase.
One member noted that, if a series of upcoming political events in Europe passed without incident, momentum for economic recovery could strengthen from the latter half of 2017.
Regarding the Bank's outlook for economic activity and prices, members concurred that overseas economies, exports, production, and some areas of domestic demand had deteriorated further from that presented in September 2012 when the Bank decided to enhance monetary easing.
Growth in business fixed investment, particularly in machinery investment, had been sluggish, as business sentiment still remained cautious.
One member added that price developments in the past revealed that consumers in Japan had been relatively tolerant of the rise in import prices being passed on to sales prices.
Some members noted that the pace of recovery in the euro area economy was likely to remain moderate, considering that fiscal consolidation measures in each euro area country were likely to weigh on the economy.
Members agreed that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (excluding fresh food) had been in line with the forecast presented in the April 2011 Outlook Report and was likely to remain slightly positive as the aggregate supply and demand balance improved as a trend.
The number of housing starts -- a leading indicator of housing investment -- had picked up from the start of the year onward, mainly in housing for rent, albeit with fluctuations.
Firms' financial positions had been favorable on the whole, although weakness had been seen in those of some firms, mainly small and medium-sized ones, reflecting such factors as the outbreak of COVID-19.
As for employment, one member noted that, if unit labor costs continued to increase, in order to maintain the large increase in the employment level, the economy would need to grow at a higher rate.
Some members expressed the view that the emergence of the fiscal deficit problem in some European countries had directed market attention to fiscal conditions worldwide, including Japan, and it had become crucial for every country to maintain market confidence in the future course of fiscal consolidation in the medium to long term.
Meanwhile, a few members said that corporate managers -- who had not yet been able to establish a medium to long-term growth strategy, and had grown increasingly frustrated -- had come to attach their expectations to monetary policy.
Some members added that markets in these economies that had taken policy actions such as the raising of interest rates were starting to regain their calmness.
Mr. G. Kataoka expressed the following opinions: (1) the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing toward 2 percent going forward was low at this point, and (2) further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was important in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, and that it was necessary for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations.
With regard to the supply side, Japan's potential growth rate remained at a low level of around 0.5 percent.
A few other members said that, if the recent trend of the yen's depreciation continued, this could be expected to have positive effects on prices through an improvement in economic activity and a rise in inflation expectations.
It expected the Bank to continue taking decisive monetary policy actions while considering the effects of the disaster on the economy and markets, as well as the progress of rebuilding.
It expected the Bank to continue to steadily carry out the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas, and to underpin the economy through appropriate and flexible conduct of monetary policy while continuing to sufficiently exchange views and keep close contact with the government in order to overcome deflation.
As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.
They then decreased somewhat significantly in January 2014 from the October-December quarter, due in part to temporary factors such as the effects of a winter snowstorm in the United States and of the Lunar New Year holidays in East Asia, as well as supply constraints driven by the front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike.
In this situation, industrial production had been on a downward trend and the pace of decrease in the number of employees had been accelerating.
In addition, due attention needed to be paid to the downside risks to the economy stemming mainly from developments in overseas economies and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.
Based on the above discussion, members shared the view that uncertainty regarding the possible effects of the disaster on Japan's economy was extremely high, and it was necessary to continue to closely examine the effects from various aspects, such as the process for eliminating supply-side constraints and developments in demand at home and abroad.
One member expressed the view that, although attention should be paid to, for example, the effects of the recent slowdown in overseas economies on consumer sentiment and other aspects, private consumption was highly likely to be firm for the time being, due mainly to steady improvement in the employment and income situation as well as to an increase in demand prior to the scheduled consumption tax hike.
Production was likely to decrease marginally in the January-March quarter of 2007 but was considered to remain on an upward trend, reflecting the rise in domestic and external demand.
As for services consumption, sales in the food service industry had continued to trend upward, and outlays for travel, especially overseas travel, had been firm.
Regarding funding conditions for long-term credit, while credit spreads of bank debentures were more or less unchanged, their issuance -- including by banks in some peripheral countries -- had been firm.
The rate of change in the producer price index (PPI) relative to three months earlier had been slightly positive recently, mainly due to the impact of the rise in crude oil prices since summer 2023.
(1) Yield curve control a) The Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.
Members concurred that emerging economies as a whole maintained their moderate recovery trend, but some had decelerated due to country-specific factors, and the NIEs and ASEAN economies were under downward pressure, as evidenced by such factors as weak exports to China.
Second, the link between the impact of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve may change as firms explore new ways of raising funds such as issuing super-long-term corporate bonds under the current monetary easing, including the negative interest rate policy.
With respect to overseas financial markets, U.S. and European long-term interest rates had risen, mainly due to speculation about a reduction in monetary accommodation by the ECB.
In addition, the employment situation had been improving steadily.
Industrial production had been picking up, due in part to the moderate increase in demand both at home and abroad as well as to the progress in inventory adjustments.
A few members noted that, if the pace of growth in the Chinese economy were to decelerate noticeably, this would affect the Bank's economic outlook, which assumed a rise in overseas economic growth.
General collateral (GC) repo rates had been more or less unchanged, but they had remained sensitive to changes in the balance between supply and demand in the market.
Business fixed investment was projected to continue to see a moderate uptrend on the back of corporate profits at high levels and highly accommodative financial conditions.
As for prices, members concurred that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy was at around 0.5 percent, partly because price rises by firms continued to be limited, while the rate of change for all items less fresh food was around 1 percent.
Members then shared the recognition that uncertainties regarding overseas economies had heightened further including (1) protectionist moves such as the U.S.-China trade friction, (2) developments in emerging economies including China, and (3) negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU).
In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar had appreciated, reflecting market participants' focus on the difference in the direction of monetary policy between the United States and other countries.
Meanwhile, business sentiment stayed at a favorable level on the whole, although the effects of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike were evident in results of some surveys for April and May.
In contrast, some members expressed the view that the previous year's surge in crude oil prices would result in stronger downward pressure on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, particularly for the period from summer until early autumn of this year.
On this basis, a few members noted that it was desirable to (1) accelerate the annual pace of increase in the monetary base from about outstanding of the Bank's holdings would be increased from an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen to about 80 trillion yen.
As for the outlook, members shared the view that, even if the U.S. economy continued to recover, the pace would be only modest given that the foundation for a recovery remained fragile -- as evidenced by the persistent strains from balance-sheet adjustments -- and that room for implementing policy actions was becoming limited.
(3) On August 8, 2013, the government had compiled the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan and the guidelines for budget requests for fiscal 2014.
The Bank conducted money market operations in accordance with the guideline decided at the previous meeting on January 17 and 18, 2007.
In China, the deceleration of the economy had come to a halt: although exports had declined, domestic demand continued to show high growth.
A few members referred to the fact that the year-on-year rate of decline in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for the Tokyo metropolitan area for October 2011 had accelerated because the positive contribution from the rise in the tobacco tax and charges for accident insurance had dissipated.
Members agreed that many indicators suggested improvement in private consumption, amid steady improvement in the employment and income situation, and that it was appropriate to revise the Bank's assessment upward to one stating that private consumption "has increased its resilience" from the previous one stating that it "has been resilient."
The budget for fiscal 2016 would be the first under the Plan to Advance Economic and Fiscal Revitalization, and the government deemed it necessary to fully realize this plan to achieve its goal of generating a surplus in the primary balance for fiscal 2020.
On this basis, the member noted that the current weak developments could again be the start of stagnation in consumption.
With regard to credit supply, financial institutions' lending attitudes -- as perceived by firms -- were significantly accommodative.
[8] In this situation, the amount outstanding of the monetary base had been in the range of 241-254 trillion yen.
As for the employment and income situation, members shared the recognition that supply and demand conditions in the labor market continued to improve moderately and employee income had also shown a pick-up.
One member expressed the view that the economy would likely be able to maintain its growth rate of about 6.5 percent on the back of an upturn in the rate of increase in fixed asset investment -- reflecting in part the progress in manufacturers' adjustments of excess production -- and with the support of stimulus measures.
Regarding global financial markets, members shared the recognition that market participants' risk sentiment had improved, mainly against the background of growing expectations for progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, and that the markets recently were stable compared with some time ago.
This member therefore was paying close attention to how the GDP-based figure for real fixed investment would be revised at the second preliminary estimate, and to how fixed investment plans were being implemented.
(5) Regarding the National Strategic Zones project, special zone meetings had been held in the Kansai area and Fukuoka City, and discussions had progressed with regard to efforts such as drawing up plans.
One member pointed out that, as a positive output gap pushes up prices for the immediate future, which simultaneously brings about the secondary effect of raising inflation expectations in an adaptive manner, it was appropriate to assess the impact of the output gap on prices in terms of the "area" calculated by multiplying the degree of the positive gap by its duration.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average had increased somewhat, mainly due to anticipation of improvement in corporate profits.
Some members commented that firms were increasingly suffering from difficult funding conditions, especially limited availability of funds, as shown by, for example, the continuing decrease in the issuance of CP and corporate bonds and by the December Tankan, which indicated that the number of firms that saw financial institutions' lending attitudes as "severe" -- not only small firms but also large ones -- exceeded those that saw them as "accommodative."
In the United States, downgrading of securitized products backed by subprime mortgage loans and the emergence of subprime mortgage-related losses at some financial institutions had led to a considerable drop in stock prices.
In response to these remarks, one member noted that, as inflation expectations in the medium to long term tended to be formed based largely on economic fundamentals such as the rate of growth in productivity, it was unlikely that such expectations would converge toward 2 percent and lead to achievement of the price stability target in about two years.
They expressed the view that the functioning of the CP and corporate bond markets had been recovering steadily.
(2) Furthermore, the government considered that it was important for the soundness of the Japanese financial system that financial authorities in Japan and abroad continue to cooperate closely.
As for the outlook, members concurred that overseas economies were likely to remain in a state of slight deceleration for the time being, but to moderately increase their growth rates as advanced economies would continue to see firm growth and emerging economies would move out of their deceleration phase on the back of the developments in advanced economies.
The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (excluding fresh food) had been around 0 percent, mainly due to earlier declines in crude oil prices.
This member, however, continued that the potential need for additional monetary easing by affecting longer-term interest rates had not yet decreased, given that there was a risk that the time necessary to achieve price stability would be prolonged.
It had launched the Council for Promotion of Foreign Direct Investment in Japan on April 25, and confirmed such items as the guidelines based on the Report on the Expert Group Meeting on Foreign Direct Investment in Japan.
Meanwhile, currencies in emerging economies and crude oil prices were generally unchanged.
One member said that, although the Bank's purchase under the Program was an unconventional policy measure, its transmission mechanism was no different from that of a conventional measure, in that the purchase would affect interest rates and risk premiums and subsequently feed through to economic activity.
Housing investment was projected to continue picking up with the employment and income situation continuing to improve steadily, supported as well by accommodative financial conditions.
The government strongly expected that this new framework would facilitate the elimination of deflationary expectations.
Private consumption, notably durable goods consumption, was picking up mainly due to policy measures, despite the continued severe employment and income situation, and this trend was likely to continue for the time being.
A few members pointed out that labor market conditions remained tight, as evidenced, for example, by the unemployment rate remaining at a low level in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent and the active job openings-to-applicants ratio maintaining its high level.
It was expected to increase gradually as supply-side constraints eased and disaster-stricken homes were rebuilt.
A different member said that growth in sales tax revenue tended to be slower in those states where the rate of decline in housing prices was faster, and this might indicate that the decline in housing prices had started to have an adverse effect on private consumption.
Private consumption had been decelerating, particularly in the ASEAN countries, against the background of (1) the end to the boost from policy measures targeted at car sales and (2) consumer sentiment having turned cautious.
In this situation, financial institutions had been tightening their lending standards.
After declining sharply following the earthquake, production and exports continued to increase with the easing of supply-side constraints.

Regarding the outlook, although such consumption was expected to be affected by price rises, it was projected to keep increasing moderately with nominal employee income continuing to improve, and partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions.
One member said that housing investment in the United States had only relatively limited effects on other economies and therefore, in examining the impact on the global economy, it was important to evaluate the extent to which the correction in the U.S. housing market and the resultant turbulence in financial markets would affect private consumption and business fixed investment in the United States.
One member was of the view that there was no change in the uptrend in the CPI, because examination of the CPI excluding energy by goods and services showed that goods prices had been rising at a very moderate pace, and services prices continued to increase gradually reflecting the increase in labor costs and the fact that imputed rent of condominiums had stopped falling.

Some members pointed out that the CAI -- calculated by the Bank by combining various sales and supply-side statistics -- had continued to rise moderately since summer 2016.
They also agreed that the Bank's massive JGB purchases had the effect of compressing risk premia, and this effect would become increasingly pronounced as the Bank proceeded with the purchases.
Based on the above discussion, members concurred that the global economy as a whole was continuing to expand, with growth gaining breadth geographically.

[6] In this situation, the uncollateralized overnight call rate had been in the range of 0.075 to 0.085 percent.

One member added that firms might have changed their price-setting behavior in the course of the recent increases in energy and materials prices and might now tend to revise their sales prices in response to external shocks more quickly than before.

With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) was likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, due to factors such as the remaining effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices.

They shared the view that overseas economies were decelerating primarily as a result of a decline in real purchasing power brought about by the earlier rise in crude oil prices, supply-chain disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan, and the effects of monetary tightening in the emerging economies.
A few members then said that, although exports were likely to maintain their moderate growth for the time being, it was important to continue monitoring them carefully as there were some developments suggesting a slowdown in overseas economies, such as a decrease in machine tool orders from China.
In addition, this member -- noting that, even if such payment were to be abolished, market functioning would be maintained under the current guideline for money market operation -- expressed the view that, in abolishing this payment, it was appropriate to review the interest rates on the loans under the Asset Purchase Program and the Loan Support Program.
